"Welcome to the (ir)regular check-in post - a place to take a moment and share what is going on and how you are doing. If you have an accomplishment you want to talk about (these shouldn't be standalone posts in the sub as they violate the ""role model"" rule, but are welcome here), or are having a tough time but prefer not to make your own post, this is a place you can share.We try our best to keep this space as safe and supportive as possible on reddit's wide-open anonymity-friendly platform. The community rules can be found in the sidebar. If you aren't sure about a rule, please ask us. If you have concerns or questions about the community policies, this is a good place to raise those as well. This time I want to share some points about helping OPs who may be at risk for suicide.   Although we understand that depression and suicidality are distinct issues and we encourage people whose main issue is suicidal thoughts and feelings to post at /r/SuicideWatch, we don't feel that any kind of ""you should post there, not here"" message could conceivably be helpful to a person in great distress.  However, the information in [the SW sidebar](/r/SuicideWatch/about/sidebar) may be of help to anyone trying to support someone struggling with thoughts of suicide.  We link the two most important posts for helpers, the talking tips and risk assessment guide, from the sidebar here, but there's a lot more there.   Almost nobody posts about their suicidal thoughts on reddit because they don't know that hotlines exist.  Just providing a hotline number without finding out how the person might feel about that option can make the person feel invalidated.  Also, if it does make sense to suggest a hotline in a particular case, don't just assume a person's in the US. Imagine the how it would feel for a US redditor to be told ""just call 116 123, that'll work everywhere"" meaning everywhere in the European Union. There's a global directory in the /r/SuicideWatch sidebar, which is also linked here, and that's the best link to offer someone whose location you don't know.   Remember that anonymity is a safety device in suicide intervention that saves far more lives than it costs.  The situations where breaching someone's confidentiality is the best option are the outliers, like when someone is strangled by a safety harness. Plus, we almost never have enough risk assessment information to justify outing someone (which has to go through reddit's admins and their legal team) and subjecting them to a traumatic, invasive, involuntary intervention, which may discourage them from opening up about their feelings in future.   If you do feel that a post needs attention from the mod team for any reason, including high risk of harm, please take a few extra seconds to send us a modmail rather than clicking ""report"".  The linkage between reports and spam is hardcoded into reddit's DNA, so clicking ""report"" on a post increases the risk that the post will be snagged by the sitewide filter, which we have no control over.   Keep in mind that the most reliable way to de-escalate someone is to give them the experience of feeling understood.  A strong interpersonal connection is usually enough to reduce immediate risk of suicide. That's one of the many reasons why [this little empathy video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Evwgu369Jw) is always linked from our sidebar. ","1"
"I'm 25, college grad, engineer, fiancee, 50k savings.I hate it all. Our life is just a constant grind. Work your ass off in school so you can go to ""good"" college.

All this effort is supposed to make you happy.

My mind is too clouded to concentrate on doing anything well. It takes so much effort to deal with all the paperwork and money management of life. I can't find a job. I owe money to like four different hospitals because of all the times I went to the E.R. thinking I was dying from something that turned out to be a panic attack.

"Jesus. How do I even start. All of this is so obvious and yet for years I haven't been able to grasp what's been happening with me in the past 12 years (I'm now 22).I'll start with the context. I've been dealing with depressive thoughts and anxiety for a period of about 5 years now and haven't been able to pinpoint the exact reasons for why I felt about myself the way I did (yeah, the imfamous ""brain fog"").I managed to finish school with ""good enough"" grades and enroll at a nice university. I have been an alright student for the most part and been successful with all the exams/challenges that came my way. But in late 2015 (the last year of my bachelors programme) I started noticing that I was not actually satisfied with my education, in fact - I didn't even like most of the courses. That dissatisfaction had lead to me questioning whether or not I should continue the chosen academic path and whether a master's degree in that specialization was worth investing an additional 2 years into or not. At that time I thought to myself: ""Of course I should go on with my education, it's a no brainer!"". Well, things started getting really bad this year when the time for my dissertation to be written has finaly come. Oh, how much was I procrastinating while having no coherent idea of the subject for my thesis... This struggle made me wonder why it's so difficult for me to come up with good ideas and that's exactly when the revelation came.FAKE. Faking. I've been faking everything since age 11. My middle school education, my interest in university courses, ""friends"". Everything was fake.I'm yet to fully grasp all the details and circumstances of the moment I turned from being a clever, curios and inquisitive boy to someone who felt the need to fake everything. But I know for a fact that it all happened when I stopped hanging out with well-behaved kids and made friends with a kid who acted like a hooligan all the time. Oh well...It's kind of shameful to arrive at such conclusion when I'm a 22-year old guy but I guess better late than never. The new road is ahead of me and I'm both scared and intrigued...","1"

My days are all the same and sometimes they all blur into one... work, sleep, eat, repeat. I spend 90% of my time alone and I dont know what its like to have someone I can trust. Someone I can talk to about the simplest things, laugh with and cry with. I have no passion. No motivation. But I do want to change. I want to be loved and I want to be needed by someone. Its hard when youve got nobody because you will never get invited places. Everyone around me has their life sorted already and they dont need a new friend. I lie about what I did on the weekend if someone ever asks and Im getting good at pretending. I get anxiety even thinking about breaking out of my daily routine that Ive created over the past few years. I dont even know where to begin. Home is my safe place. ","1"

"It's been over two and a half years since you last said you loved me. It's been just over two years since you last spoke to me. I've moved, changed jobs, travelled the country, made new friends, climbed mountains, had experiences I could once have only dreamed. Yet try as I might, I can't get you to leave me. A day, an afternoon, many times an hour can't go past without me thinking of you. Longing for you, your love, your companionship, your friendship. And that truly is what I miss most of all; I miss my best friend. You were everything I ever wanted in life, angel. Unfortunately for me, you still are. And knowing you will never even give me the time of day again is slowly killing me. It's a slower death than I first thought it'd be, I admit. I'm still here, after all. But I don't want to be. It's been so long since I've wanted to be alive I'm not really entirely sure I know what that feeling is like anymore. I'd trade everything for just an acknowledgement of my existence by you at this point. Everything I've done the last six or seven years or so has been for you, angel, that way somebody truly in love just exists. I wish I could turn that off. To move on. To stop loving a woman who will never love me. But it turns out, my thrive damned loyalty has a lot of experience staying loyal when things suck. Even when I don't want to. In all those terrible fanfics we love(d?) to read, eventually that loyalty would pay off and we'd get our happy ending. In reality, my love for you is a ghost that haunts my every step, reminding me every minute of every day at how close I came to nirvana. Of how of all people I was going to get my happily ever after. That we were going to be one of the lucky ones. How naive. All I want for Christmas is still you, angel. And it always will be. Whether I want it to be or not. I love you. ","1"

I don't feel qualified for pretty much any kind of job in my field. I don't know why anyone would hire me. I hate everything. There is no hope. Only the daily slog. I don't have intentions. Only desire. I would and could never do it. There are people in my life I love far more than I love myself, and for them I will keep going. But it just seems easier to stop.

I was staying at my family house. There was nothing to worry, no feeling of loneliness and my anxiety got much better. I would sleep at like 11 and wake up at around 7, go to the gym and then have a breakfast with my mom. I was so happy and feeling confident. Now I'm in a different city for college. I never experienced something like this before. I'm feeling this way for like 2 months. I used to have some bad days but thats it. Now im so scared and anxious about my future thinking i will never get better and be the person i actually am. I'm a 20 yo male and i feel like wasting my young years and thinking this makes it even worse. Waking up is so hard these days, i miss the days i wake up feeling refreshed and radiant. Now i don't even want to look in the mirror. Only thing that would make me feel better is being with my mom but its not possible now. I can't even go to school for days.

"Well, probably it isnt first one,but first official one. Had no idea what was going on, whole body started to shake, hand and head felt numb, called ambulance and went to the hospital. Spent night there was feeling well, doctors told me to go check heart later. Got home and it started again but i learnt how to control it.Almost week later after that, i feel really strange. It feels like i'm in a dream. Everything is boring, i can't even play my fav games as i just dont focus to them. I feel like i'm still sleeping, i also feel empty. I hope someone else felt like this before and could help me. I don't know if everything is like this because i have depression. I don't know if i do. Feels like it. But before when i was sad i could play,read books or such and feel better. Now i'm afraid to get out of my bed because it might start again. And it happens even if i'm in bed, yesterday before sleep my right arm started shaking randomly and i couldn't control it.  So, is it possible that my fear is somehow connected to depression and vice versa? Should i go to doctors again? (Was at heart doctors yesterday, said i'm fine,nerves doctor also said i'm fine). Should i go to psycho-something(lol) for the first time? I really don't know what to do anymore. Don't want to tell more about this to my parents as they would be afraid, don't want to write about this to my friend either:I Sorry for my bad english, hard to think about grammar when i'm feeling like this, and i'm also very sorry if this is wrong sub for this.

"Hey there my depressed babes! I just wanted to share some hopeslowly Ive come out of the worst bout of depression Ive ever experienced, and I just want to encourage anyone who is going through it that it can and will get better, even if slowly. Sometimes we have to force ourselves to keep moving and then we get betterthats what happened to me. I lost my job, lost my apartment, had to move back in with my mom, and was a general wreck of disassociation and suicidal thoughts. Turns out I also had a B12 deficiency which can cause depression/anxiety. Found a new job, started taking vitamins, slowly got backinto a routine, and now Im fine. It was a weird time. I hope to never go back there; it scares the living shit out of me, but to those who are going through it, you are valuable and you do have purpose. Find something, anything, and do that.

"Hi everyone. First time poster. Trying not to internalize my emotions so much, and honestly, I need someone to listen.I've been diagnosed with depression since I was 13, and now that I'm 22 it's just gotten so much harder to handle. Normally I can handle myself and still stay productive, but over the last two years I've felt my grip on myself start to slip.For the past 3 days, it's been worse than it's been in years. I can't even talk to anybody I know about it because they don't understand what it's like. ""Just do something fun that'll make you happy"" and ""You need religion"" were two of the responses I've gotten so far when I try to reach out.I had a friend who understood, someone who has experienced it for himself, but last night I lashed out and now I think it's over between us. Whenever I get really depressed, I don't know how to handle myself. I can't afford meds or a therapist with my work and insurance now and I'm just really scared.Last night, for the first time since I was in high school, I seriously considered suicide. I managed to convince myself that I only had friends because they pitied me, and my family only kept in contact because they feel guilty. For the first time in a long time, I felt completely alone.Don't get me wrong. I enjoy life and all it has to offer, but last night, a switch was flipped and now all I can think of is the pros and cons of offing myself so I'm no longer on this crazy ride. Again, I really don't want to, but the thoughts are like thunder in my head.I must not be the only one who's been in this situation. How do you manage and keep your head above water when it feels like you're trapped under the ice?","1"

"I'm exhausted. Physically and mentally. Depression has been with me for most of my life. I ended up making big life changes to hopefully break out of it. Lost a ton of weight, moved to new area, found a job I enjoyed, and made friends. Yet, my depression is worse. I feel empty as ever.I used to have escapes. Being with family, movies, games, writing, music, going out, working out, etc. But, my depression is vampiric in the way that it sucks the enjoyment out of everything. One by one each have become joyless and chore like.  It feels as though depression finally won. It has consumed me. Broken me. And the worst part of it all is knowing that I'll always have this. I've never wanted to give up more.It has gotten to the point where all that is on my mind is suicidal thoughts and bullying myself. If I could just have one escape back it would be great. Even just being able to sit down to enjoy a video game instead of forcing myself to. I just want to escape the thinking. Just for a bit.","1"

"I was having a chat with my friend whos off in university yesterday and I talking about humanity as a topic. Hows were all truly selfish and how compassion is just a lie. Where in reality we all do these actions to make ourselves feel better. To boost our ego and to just make feel like were someone better. Just if your comforting someone whos crying and youre comforting them out of pity so that you can make yourself feel better you know? He said, that my views on humanity are dangerous and thats hes concerned for my mental health now. He says that its getting worse. I said that I dont trust everyone except a select few (3-4 people) not even my parents or my relatives. Cause I dont trust people until they reveal their true intentions, colours etc. After I said this, he got very concerned.  Hes asking me to see the real world. But I see the real world for as it is. Hes saying Im not and instead of looking at rose-coloured glasses Im looking at the world with Dark-Black coloured glasses.  Afterwards I asked him why, and he said that hes afraid Ill kill myself because of these thoughts or think so little of human life that I become a sociopath and kill someone. He remembers when I was a compassionate and caring, and how he says that Im hiding everything behind a black and negative curtain. How Im losing myself and turning into a very dark and cynical person. Theyre right I guess. My mental health and my own personality has been very dark and cynical lately. I dont like talking to anyone, like I used to. I consider everyone an annoyance. All the chores I do are just meaningless. Like right now I should be studying. But I dont want to. Like whats the point. I just want to forget everything. Not only that, I feel like Im running out of time. Of my own existence or how long Im gonna last. And judging from that sense, Im not gonna last that much longer if I keep going down this path. ","1"
"So maybe this post isn't all to the point in some places, but I just like to get things off my chest.I'm a guy in my mid-twenties and I've been living in a new city on my own for a couple of months now. I moved out of my parents' after I had my first full time job for a year or so. I've had periods of depression before, mainly due to feelings of loneliness and (social) anxiety. I don't have any close friends, because in the past I'd either feel fine being on my own or otherwise felt too anxious to go out and actually meet people. I was certain that living on my own would become more difficult in that regard, so I needed to do something to counteract a possible recurring depression. What I did was join a dance class in that city. I still take classes and go to social dance evenings regularly and I really enjoy it. It has also been a great boost in building self-confidence and I've become a bit less uptight around people. So this has been one of the best decisions I've made in life so far I'm certain.Another thing I did was join a martial arts class, to get more in shape and also to make friends of course.I sometimes attend a meetup. I've also been thinking about going out of the house more and work on my sketchbook in public places; since I enjoy drawing and might also meet people this way hehe. But aside from these things I don't much hang out with people outside of the classes and I feel lonely a lot. Yesterday I felt miserable to spend the night alone in my apartment.A couple of months ago I was travelling somewhere for a week and I met a lovely girl. We were both interested in drawing, it's actually her profession, and I think it clicked well between us. We spent a couple of days together there, and after separating we kept in touch through texts because we live quite far apart now. A while ago we talked about travel plans and she said she liked to meet again when I asked her, so now we're going to travel together again for about three weeks. :DSo that's going to happen and I'm very excited and happy about this. However, what makes me feel a little sad and sometimes bitter is that, when I hear what's she's doing or when I look her up on social media, it looks like she's having such an interesting life. She seems to have many good friends and her career allows her to travel a lot and meet so many interesting people. I know she's worked so hard for this and I think she has really earned it, but I can't help the feeling of inadequateness and sadness when I reflect back on my life right now.Maybe I'm just whining. Hope you guys are willing to give some advice on how to approach this. Thanks!","1"

"TL;DR:Depressed, anxious, shut in, lonely, heartbroken, suicidal, really need someone to speak to.Heya, I've posted here before which you can see on my profile, but nothing has stuck. Basically the same thing applies, but I really do now know how I can even make it through tonight feeling this empty and lonely. I don't start my anti-depressants until Thursday, and even then they can take weeks before they come into affect. I never speak up until I'm was past my limit, which is why it has taken me so many years to even see a doctor, which I did for the first time last Thursday but I was stupid and hesitated on the anti-depressants so now I must wait until Thursday. I have something for my anxiety but all it does is stop my body from shaking by slowing my heart or something, but does nothing to actually help the feeling. I'm still shut in and even struggling to go downstairs for food.I appreciate kind messages, but the amount of times I've heard the same stuff, it just feels so meaningless and empty. Hopefully I can find someone who understands, or even willing to just try and understand. I would prefer voice calling too, even though I get so scared of answering the phone etc, words on a screen are just so empty. It would be awkward to start with but I'm okay once I warm up to people a little bit.Again, with my stupid thoughts, I would appreciate it if you were female, I've never been able to speak to guys, I use to have one close guy friend but he moved away when we left school and I haven't spoken to him since. He was the only one who knew how I felt, with my self harm and suicidal thoughts. I'm sorry I have this mindset but I find it far easier to speak to someone who is female. I went through a really tough breakup in September too so love is not on my mind, I don't want to love or be loved in that way again.If you made it this far, I really appreciate it and I hope you have a lovely afternoon. I'm in the UK if that matters.","1"
"How do you even get help when you barely have the energy or will power to get out of bed? The idea of just finding a primary care doctor and/or therapist seems like Mount Everest let alone getting on a medication, going to therapy consistently and taking other steps to get better. I don't know what to do anymore. I hate being alive, but I have to go to work. I have to take care of my daughter. I have to be alive, but I'm not living. I'm existing and even that seems like a strong word to describe what I'm doing. Every day feels like I've reached my breaking point, but when you're this far gone, how does rock bottom even really help other than to make you feel more miserable because you have nothing left inside of you to climb out of rock bottom? Has anyone been here and made it out? Where do I start? I need a plan that is micro-baby steps at a time. Not only do I struggle with the depression and anxiety, but I have several chronic health problems that make everything that much harder. I don't know how to hope anymore. I wish I could just wake up tomorrow and be happy and ""normal"". ","1"
"It basically translates to ""I don't really care about you but I'd feel bad if you killed yourself"".  I mean, ignore me the rest of the time and then once I'm actually feeling good, just make me feel like an inferior piece of shit.  Thanks a lot.  I'm a big boy now, I can sort myself out.I know the intentions are good, but I just managed to work my way out of a depressive episode - completely isolated - and tbh felt pretty good about having so much self control, something to prove to myself that I am managing to get better without anyone else's help.  That is probably the last thing I wanted to hear.  I would have preferred someone to tell me to kill myself, at least then you can tell them to fuck off and gain a little bit of determination to keep going.I can't get over just how shit that made me feel.  I mean, is that really all people think of me?  Yes I have my demons but you have no idea what I'm capable of.  Stop treating me like a fucking child.","1"
"Hey there! I've never actually posted a new thread on reddit before, but I think this is a topic that is most definitely worth giving the honour as my first post.I've been living with endogenic depression for a couple years now, I tried councilling and I found it way too difficult to open up to a stranger, so that didn't really work. I went to the doctors and was prescribed Sertraline. For a lot of people this drug does wonders, but for me it did not. Less than a week in I started to develop violent thoughts. After a couple weeks they were getting way too much to handle and I decided that they were not the answer for me.This made me feel hopeless, as you could imagine. I felt like this black hole which festers inside of me would never go away. About a week ago, my dad has suggested that I should try Valerian root tablets (500mg). I was very skeptical at first, I thought that if modern day pharmaceuticals did not work, then how could a plant? I know Valerian is usually used for Anxiety, but often enough anxiety and depression go hand in hand. Since I started taking them, I've woken up every morning feeling calm & composed. I haven't felt depressed now for about 4 days (unprecedented since I've falled prey to depressions foul grasp) and I haven't felt this good about myself for longer than I can remember.If anyone reading this can relate to anything I have wrote, I really do suggest you try it. I got 60 tablets from my local herbalist for 9 and I can honestly say you should give it a try. I don't know how much drugs like Sertraline cost in the US with your healthcare system, but if its more expensive than that, it may be worth exploring...If you're feeling like there are no more avenues to explore, don't give up hope just yet! You never know when a branch of hope will be extended, but it will come! If you've made it this far, then I really thank you for reading :)","1"

I think Ive reached a point where I have no choice but to detach myself from these people once and for all. Theyll never change and will suck me dry as long as Im around.Anyone else feel this way.

My dad was gone for most of it and got back so late I didnt do the traditional cake and candles. Everyone else kind of went about the day as normal. I spent my birthday eating popcorn alone and watching bobs burgers under my blankets trying not to cry.Its been really conflicting. I hate that all these things made me feel sad on my birthday.

"I feel like Ive hit the highest point in my life. There really doesn't seem to be anywhere I can go to improve anymore.I went to college to get an associate's in Game Design, couldnt after one semester since my parents worked so hard against me to assist in financial aid that I still owe 23k for that semester. My own art isn't much better than it was before either; its pretty much stabalized at average-mediocre compared to other artists out there. And now Im just a supervisor for security at a museum barely scraping by for rent and other personal bills with a few roommates while still being unable to pay my student loan in any way shape or form.What I really detest is that I am aware I should get help, that maybe I just need proffesional guidance, possibly medication. But I cant seem to find any place around NYC that doesnt already cost whats basically an arm and a leg to me to be at and I can barely afford live paycheck to paycheck anyway. Just, once again reminding me that I cant even afford to keep my own life afloat, let alone attempt to improve it. I also know I can speak to my partner, but the problem is with her having own mental issues it can get in the way of me trying to explain my feelings; i.e. getting angry at me/feeling like I dont trust her and therefore not trusting me because I didnt tell her I was feeling a certain way asap, or uncontrollably crying because she feels inadequate for keeping me from feeling the way I do despite reassurance that this is just an effect of depression. So, I kind of keep it to myself really, and then have spikes and think ""wow I need help"", leading to thinking about how I cant afford it, then remembering that I'm in a spot that wil very likely not improve for a very long time.Honestly, I have every tool I need to just end it straight away but I'm fully aware of the impact it will have on my loved ones and how inconvenient itd be to those around me, so I continue to stick around.

"My friend has cut twice now, and has only told it to my other friend and I. The first time after we talked with her, she seemed to know not to do it again, though I think she was only more depressed thinking herself an idiot for doing it in the first place. However, a few days ago she had done it again and showed it to my other friend. This other friend told me and we both agreed the school counselor needed to be involved, as her parents supposedly previously dismissed her depression and refused to have her diagnosed. I assume her parents were immediately contacted as when I got back home, she had been threatening my other friend through a group chat, saying that now her parents knew, her life was ruined. Today, somehow she found out I was involved as well and has been spamming me angrily. Im scared to confront her on Monday, but I was prepared for that. What Im more scared of is the possibility that she may think because of this that her life has been ruined and that continuing cutting and even suicide is a good idea. Edit:I just want this to end. Im depressed myself but right now I cant stop looking back at those messages and laying here and thinking myself in to a hole. Ive felt like this before but I still hate it. Even if you have nothing to say a comment helps. Sorry. ","1"
"This is a pretty long and personal post so I appreciate everyone who reads this.Growing up I had a pretty rough childhood. I used to always get bullied by the other children because of how weak I was. I remember not getting past a day without crying till the 9th grade. Nobody really cared about me at school, everyone just thought of me as the class clown and someone to make fun of. Our financial condition is very poor so I never had all the new stuff that others had. Every passing day was hell for me but I somehow coped up with it.In 9th grade I started trying to be more extroverted. I met this girl who was in my class and we hit it off pretty well. I think at one point she even started to like me. But no matter what I would do I was still weak and pathetic. I was too much of a pussy to tell her that I loved her. Its been more than 3 years since I last talked to her and I still miss her to this day. I would leave away everything just to be with her.Because of this I have been single till now. I'm extremely introverted and haven't had a good conversation with any girl since then. The anxiety and depression also comes due to my poor financial condition. Where I live mostly everyone drives a bike whereas I walk around which just shoots my anxiety up. I'm too poor to even buy new clothes for myself. I've thought of working part time at some job but that's impossible due my college timings. Although I've started making efforts by freelance web designing they have been to no use. In two weeks I will be turning 19 and this is the most depressed and low I have been all my short life. I have officially hit rock bottom. This depression is resting on my heart for two reasons: Love and money. Every day goes on and I keep living like a lifeless zombie. I have no compassion left in life anymore. It's like I don't see the point in living. I would try and kill myself but I can never do that to my mom . She is the only person I care about as much as the girl I love. Even therapy is pointless because I live in a third world country and if I told everyone they would just tell me to deal with it and spending money on therapy is pointless. I don't even know what to do anymore. I am scared about my future. I feel like I am going to die alone and poor. I just want my life to change.","1"

"I apologize for the length of this post, but I'm not much of  a talker and these things tend to fester in my mind for a long time before I air them out. i am not sure where the best place for this post is, so I may put it in multiple subreddits.  I feel like I am losing control now, and something horrible is going to happen. I am no longer feeling ""positive"" about anything. Whereas before I sometimes felt hopeful about things and strived towards socially acceptable goals(although I inevitably fucked up every single time), I am now simply filled with rage. Before it was mild anxiety, or sadness, or hopefulness. Now it is just hopelessness, despair, and RAGE. I feel like I need revenge on something. I cant put my finger on it, but someone needs to pay for my life, and not just mine. I want to break things, I want to scream, I want to beat people to a bloody pulp for minor annoyances. I have never been a sociable person, although I have tried to be in the past two years.   All of these efforts seem wasted, because just like all of my other endeavors, fitness, healthy eating, learning a new language, musical interests,  etc, they are obliterated and made useless in at most a few months, when I slump back into an acceptance of the meaninglessness of life, and feel as if I am unplugged from the matrix. This analogy is a strong representation of how I feel about life in general. Other people are always working towards something and all of their problems seem to be related to that concrete thing. I cant even get past the idea of why I should give a shit in the first place. Perhaps I am cuttoff from the biology that allows them to feel meaning. I am unplugged from my coworkers, my friends, my family. People always say, take a step away and look at a sunset, isn't it beautiful?. Is this supposed to be a trump card or something? Fuck no it isn't beautiful, its just a waste of my time!. Does anyone truly believe in these platitudes, or is it simply a desperate grasp at happiness? IT makes me feel so alien and as if I am simply of a different species when people tell me to do this. Or to find a hobby, or do something I enjoy, or follow my passion. Obviously I do all of these things to the best of my ability, with little success. Perhaps I really am an alien, if the solution is this evident to to other people, and meaningless to me/  Things are only getting worse despite my recent efforts. I don't want to try to get better again. I feel like I am simply pulling the wool over my eyes for a few weeks only to have it inevitably ripped off like a band-aid, and immersed back into the horrifying, real, hopeless world that I know. The temporary hope only makes this process more painful. I hate everything. I used to want a girlfriend. Now I cant understand why anyone would want a girlfriend. I don't want anyone to have these things, I wish only the worst for others. I used to want children. Now I could never bring myself to perpetuate this species, and to bring more people into this world. I hope for the apocalypse. Every day now has simply become a matter of distracting myself until the next day. Its getting more and more difficult. I see no future any longer, which can only mean death. But not before something horrible happens. I am too angry and have too much dignity to simply take myself out of the equation. I have the sinking feeling that someone or something needs to pay for my life. I know it doesn't make sense, but nothing does. I feel abandoned, I am a 20 year old male, and I feel like my childhood was a lie. It didn't prepare me for life as a 9-5 worker. I wasn't quite raised on a silver spoon, but to many I would be. I was raised on the fantasies of the adventures of adult life, rather than grown to accept them. I am not used to feeling this alone, or this independent. My parents always had money, but what they didn't give me was a reason to live. No religion. And many people seem to be able to cope with this, but I cant for some reason. When I fall, there is nothing there to catch me. I mostly live plagued by those dreaded existential thoughts that can never go away. I feel like the next 50 years or so wont be able to compete with my childhood and will only get much much worse. Why should I keep on living? I am having the most terrible thoughts now, blaming others for my misfortune, hating people simply to have something to do, and even though I know they are illogical, I see no reason not to feed them. My life has not gotten better, it has shown me the carrot for brief periods of time, only to plunge me deeper into darkness than ever the next second. I am starting to grow irreversibly bitter. I feel that the truth of the world is horrible. I am starting to accept that. All I do is eat, watch porn, play video games, and watch TV. These are the only things I can sort of focus on. This is not for lack of trying. I have tried innumerable activities. I lose interest in them very quickly. I have attempted to develop the supposed key to life, the holy DISCIPLINE, numerous times and have failed miserable every fucking time. I have tried using a checklist to make my goals manifest, have tried taking things slowly, making small changes here and there, have tried to delay gratification. But why should I? Evidently this question defeats me every time. I am cursed with a brain that thinks itself out of existence. Many people seem to buy right into life. Caring about others, feeling guilt and shame, and happiness, and  sadness. They follow these emotions as if they mean something. As if they have some true level of authority and give them the right to continue to live, a warrant of sorts. I have come to view my emotions as simply another level of control my body and the world put upon me, mere shackles.   I feel like I have a front row seat to the making of a monster. The first step to becoming a monster is to cast off your emotional shackles. The next is to deny responsibility. I have a hard time beleiving in free will, so this has already been accomplished. The last step is to lose hope in a future. Despite the near completion of this process, I feel a strange urge to look back at the illusion. That illusion of  society, unity as a species, love, longingly. I am a little bit afraid to cut ties with this. My whole life has been guided by the facade of a common good, objective meaning, and love for my fellow man. And it has been gradually ripped from my mind piece by piece. I am mildly terrified by all of this, and as always, confused. Is it possible to escape this ?","1"

I was stupid and I guess I either fell for an elaborate job scam or the guy who gave me the job just fucked me over really badly. My paypal account is negative 15k. The people who sent me money kept opening up disputes against and paypal took their side, even though I told them about my thoughts and showed them pictures of my conversations with the guy who gave me the job .  Even though Im on prozac, Ive had suicidal thoughts over this because Im so ashamed of myself for being so stupid and being my own worst enemy.  I reported it to ic3 but then I think why should they help me? I got myself into this mess.  I told my mom about this but she was disappointed in me and didnt make me feel better I know I need to get back up and find a real job but it seems so overwhelming and scary right now. In September  I was vacationing in Montana with $6k and now Im going through financial trouble again. I have a lot of  student loan debt and going to need new breaks and tires soon. Really brings me down.  This is going to make me sound like a narcissistic selfish cunt, but when I think about those stories about rich people being depressed, I feel jealous but keep it to myself. I cant help it. Then again I shouldnt feel jealous because they are probably successful and not a dumbass like me. I just spoke to a free mental health crisis counselor and now gonna look for ongoing counseling for this.  Sorry about the self pity party. TL;DR: was stupid and got myself financially fucked over and just hating myself for it. If you read the whole thing, thanks for your time. ","1"

"I don't have interests because I'm too unintelligent to learn about anything, even when I want to. I never did great in school. I don't understand people or how to befriend them. All around I am a very stupid person.Whenever I look for support people tell me to get a hobby, go look out in public, or something. But I'm too stupid for any of that to work. So I think I'm not fit for life.I don't have friends and people never really like me. I don't know what I'm waiting for from life. I've never enjoyed life. I don't know what I expect to happen but I still have a little optimism.I have to wonder if I was born like this or I became like this. I was molested as a child and I believe that might have given me depression and possibly PTSD though I'm not sure about that. But I have been depressed from a young age and that didn't help me growing up.All I want is friends and support, I would be the happiest I've ever been. I've never had someone tell me they love me or someone who wants good things to happen to me. I can't imagine having someone like that. I'm just not interesting enough for friends.","1"

"At the beginning of the year I was going through complete hell when dealing with clinical depression and anxiety. Living day by day was a struggle. There were days where I felt depersonalization, loneliness and pure sadness. I'm happy to say I'm functioning almost normal again but numbness and rumination still remains. If you're reading this don't give up your fight just yet. It'll become better in the long run ","1"
"Hi, I'm F[18] and last year/this spring I ended up with a depression, the second time in my life. As I was 12, I developed an eating disorder which continued as a depression and then led to some test for autism and ADD. The test come out somewhat positive but still very unclear and I have never related to them either. They prescribed me on top of the antidepressants and sleeping pills some Ritalin and later they changed it to Elvanse. Jumping forward a couple years, I'm still taking Elvanse and just as the Ritalin, it gives me some side effects - like headache, sleep deprivation, loss of appetite. No doctor took notice of this so I kept taking them for a couple of years. So last year, medicine was all wrong at the same time as I went through the toughest year in school AND I managed to fuck up almost all my relationships with friends. Some due too jealousy, some due too an arising depression. Letting go of some of these people was hard but really, REALLY good. I don't see any reason to go into my depression any deeper but it was pretty bad.After a while, I actually got some real help and some better medicine. I bought myself a little puppy, Lola, who became my new friend and routine helper. Stuff got a little better and the summer came. I had some trips planned with my family and I actually looked forward to them. My mental state was actually good! I met a guy, who lives 4 hours flight from me which was kinda perfect at the time because I couldn't be coughed up in this relationship like I've done before...School started and it went okey. No social stuff but still okey. It felt good. Met the guy a couple of times during the autumn and my dog Lola made me company every night etc. But now I'm starting to miss having some friends but I have no idea how to find new once. So I'm asking you, other past-depressive people of Reddit who have been in the same position, how'd you do it? Because even if I feel like getting social again I'm still insecure and unmotivated from the depression which makes it all more confusing for me. And btw, sorry if I'm unclear in my storytelling or/and grammar.. :)","1"
"Its been a few weeks since I've been done with my Ketamine Infusion. I'll try to to keep it short and simple and I'll be around to answer any questions if they come up.What it didnt do:1. I didn't have any trippy experiences or out of body while being on ketamine. 2. Didn't do anything at all for my anhedonia. 3. Didn't eradicate depression. What it did do:1. Put me in more stable and calm state, no more highs/lows but more of a baseline mood.Where depression is still there but not on the endless loop cycle as it was before.2. I'm starting to do small things bit by bit, reading, working out, cleaning up my room , getting rid of stuff I don't need.3. I can't be around too much negative stuff anymore,sometimes I do get stuck being caught in it but can quickly get myself out. 4. Starting a small part time gig doing repetitive stuff which I think is good for me right now. 5. Mood swings are almost non-existent.Will it benefit you? I can't tell but I would have to say if its more related to glutamate then Ketamine may be of help. Alot of our diet and a few other things wreak havoc on our glutamate system while most of the mainstream chooses to just talk about dopamine and serotonin. Glutamate being out of wack is a serious condition that can lead to horrible diseases down the road.I feel that this can be extremely beneficial to those with suicidial thoughts, depression loops, and need something to cut that thought pattern. You may also have to go on other medications as well, since ketamine can give you brain a break from all the negative thinking and then throw in something to give you motivation to get stuff done. It sucks how much the treatment costs.I'd love to do it once a month. When  ketamine works right its almost like it shuts off a part of your brain that wants to be depressed and over think things. Almost like an anti-anxiety with slight relaxing euphoria. But it doesn't last long. I truly believe the god of dissociatives and depression healing in the future if it ever makes a comeback and begins trials will be MXE. I've tried all sorts of medications with absolutely horrible side effects. While the 2 weeks I did Ketamine wasn't too much fun (had highs/lows) ,once it was over I've been put in this relaxed state of mind. Only bad thing is  that since I have nothing to do or like due to anhedonia it can drive me a bit crazy at times.","1"
"Hey all,I'm a college student and this semester was absolutely horrible. One of my closest friends who helped me so much through this is dead, I hate my classes, I'm starting to hate friends, and I just generically have no hope for anything. I don't want to drop out but I don't want to sit at home and work and work and work endlessly. I'm barely finding the motivation to finish this post. I can't find the motivation to finish a half-page cover letter to an extremely important apprenticeship for the summer that I need, and I've been working on that for literally 3 weeks now, for half a fucking page. Just, how the hell do you cope with this? Video gaming is a bore, I'm exercising my sorry ass off, I eat healthy, I read, and nothing is helping me. I'm trying meds and I hate them. I've tried journaling to cope and it's done nothing but made it worse. The person I could just hug it out with and talk to forever is gone. Just what the fuck? How do you manage this shit? Fuck this depression.I do hate to say I've fallen enough where I've tried/attempted/made an attempt to kill or hurt myself 5 times in total these past 3 months (wussed out trying it with a knife twice, next time I messed up the noose and it failed(The closest I've gotten), third I tried to  walk to a bridge to jump off but couldn't after a friend saw me and wouldn't stop following me after they detected something was wrong with me, after that I generically tried choking myself out with a belt which clearly does not work).I mean, I dunno I don't want to die but fuck this. I hate this shit. I talked about all of this with her and she always comforted me and just hugged it out with me until I was better, and now she's gone. I'm trying to talk about this little by little with my other closer friends, but they don't understand. Like yes I'm depressed stop over reacting. I don't know how I'm suppose to bring up my attempts.I don't know what to do. I've got a school break in 2 weeks and desperately want to get better in my month-long break. I desperately want to get off working at least until Christmas to cope. I don't want to take a college break. I want to come back happy next semester. ","1"

"I was very depressed as a kid. I lost a parent when I was 10, but it didn't affect me directly. It was having nothing to do, no parent to guide you. My dad (who took care of me) had lost his wife so he was in bad shape and never really gave me attention. I played video games,  a LOT. 10 hours a day. I failed school and got a dead end job, all that rubbish.Then, while I was 17-19 I found it. I found the thing that took me out of what seemed to be a depression cycle. I started earning good money. I mean really good money. Money a 17 year old shouldn't earn. But I was the best salesman that company had ever seen because I just wouldn't stop chasing the money. Like a fucking rabid dog. Them two years I worked my ass off to make my own company, because I wanted more and more money. I took better care of myself, but most importantly I got a girlfriend. It was like I never realised I had depression, and I had finally broken out of it. I could walk into any public place with a smile on my face. I felt like people were always happy to see me. Felt like the king of the world.I started my business, it failed. I learned a lot. I didn't give up, I was on the verge of doing well. I got back to the drawing board, working hard to rewrite my mistakes.Then my dad kicked me out. 2 months I was sleeping in my car, no contact. I was in a bad place, but still happy. I had my girlfriend, and got another deadend job so I could invest the proceeds to my business.Then my girlfriend left me. It's hard losing the first girl you love, we were together for 2 years. Combined with the lack of money and progress, and the homelessness, that's where I slipped back into the depression cycle.Right now it's the weekend, usually I'd be out for dinner, or away visiting another city or even country. I had everything, yet here I am writing my thoughts out in the hope to find some motivation.My business is all set and ready to go. I've been working at this dead end job for 5 months, saving as much as I possibly can. Everyone took the piss out of me at the start. I was put in bins, stones thrown at me. Beaten up, verbally abused every day.I don't know if I'll ever be like I was. I would much rather relive the last two years than the rest of my life. All I know is that I have been working my ASS off. I'm talking 16 hour days.They say money doesn't make you happy. Maybe it doesn't to the majority. But I strive to be wealthy. It's what I've always wanted. On the new year I'm going to get back to business, and start making some serious money. Quitting both jobs. No bullshit, no feeling guilty for leaving. I'm going back to the person I used to be, taking no shit from anyone. Get myCharisma back. Clean myself up.I've worked so hard to reach the level of happiness I've always wanted. I just hope that it works out.","1"

"I got the nexplanon implant almost a year ago and as a form of birth control I love the fact that it's always just there and I don't have to ""maintain"" it (like taking a pill every day) and I especially love that it's completely stopped my periods.Since I got it I've noticed myself having more mood swings and feeling depressed more often, especially after 6 months when my periods stopped. I know these are possible side effects but I don't know if they are coming from the implant or if it's just me and I don't know what to do. Like I said I love it as a form of birth control and the main reason I chose it is because I know I wouldn't be able to swallow a pill every day since I hate swallowing pills. I also know that most forms of contraception have the same possible side effects so switching to something else would likely have the same effect on me.I know I have a tendancy to be depressed anyway before I had it but it has got a lot worse, however there are other factors making my life very stressful at the moment so I don't know if the implant is to blame.I've obviously been thinking about going to the doctors but I'm worried they'll just want to take it out when I'd prefer to go on medication for my mood if possible. I've never seen a doctor about it before because it's always been something I thought I could handle on my own, I was embarrassed and I don't believe in medicating everything (for example if I have a headache I'll never take aspirin etc I'll just try alternative methods to alleviate it). Now it feels like it's taking over too much of my life and I've been getting into depressed moods that last for days, sometimes weeks, at a time and I just can't shake them off anymore.What should I do and what's your opinion on changing contraception method?","1"
"A while back I was really depressed, but after anti depressants and some therapy I started feeling really chill. Actually, I have been feeling quite happy and relax lately.

Appetite issue: Have been binge eating...okay that can be an issue Sleep too much, do not feel like getting out of bed...may be that's an issue too  Some anxiety, well its mainly due to work probably Okay, i have above issues, but I do not feel like trapped and sad and troubled...My doc insists the issues I have are signs of depression. I mainly go to her due to social phobia and these discipline issues etc, I have been feeling fine overall though. What has been stressing me out is actually the fact that she said I am still troubled while I have been thinking I'm fine..that's what's been stressing me out and is making me wanna cry.Also, feelings like ""guilt"" and ""worthlessness"", I do not think I really have those, but she says you are in denial, you are trying to make excuses....Really I am not the kind of person who does wrong to others, so why would I feel guilt...and ""worthlessness"", I have been an independent and career oriented person, yes I have flaw of interpersonal skills, but that does not make me ""worthless""...I do not like that she is insisting like that...is she stereotyping me or something...Any thoughts?

"Hey whoever reads this..So I have some things I am longing to understand and I'm hoping maybe someone can help. I always found myself quite different from others, still normal but like I had something else too. When I was around 14 my interest in and desire to experience something more became manifest and I got into smoking hash which eventually turned into almost 10 years of daily smoking weed ( with some breaks here and there) I also got into cocaine which I believe was very damaging to me, also speed, MDMA.. I suffered alot and when I look back now it seems that from 16 onwards I was a mess, alot of depression and struggle. I stopped all drugs by age 22 , hardest thing to stop was weed, after I stopped I was a mess, the world was empty to me , had anger issues, couldn't find any pleasure or peace or normality anywhere.. around this same time I started to notice a pattern.. that I would have 2 weeks where I felt really good, the world was great and I loved myself and life.. then I'd have 2 weeks of horrible depression like someone had switched the life switch off.After noticing this I began to research over the next few years and became convinced that I had bipolar ( the more mild type not sure if it's type 1 or 2 , think it's 1 ) so this went on for few years , up and down up and down until recently.. This year since august something really changed.. I haven't felt that ""high"" , mania , or normality.. whatever it actually is.. it just doesn't come anymore.. and I'm going through hell trying to figure out what's wrong with me and how to fix it or improve it.. last few months I feel like I've lost my identity, lost my personality, lost my existence.. I have no desire to do things, I always feel unsatisfied and am longing to feel the goodness of life again.. I believe I have some damage or problem in my dopamine system, my symptoms exactly match those of a dopamine deficiency.. Now I have done much research into supplements , and have tried a few.. they do nothing at all for me for some reason..THE ONLY THING THAT FILLS THE EMPTY GAP AND GIVES ME LIFE AND FEELING IS DARK CHOCOLATE OR COCAO. This is the only thing that can do that, and I really want to understand why , what's going on in my brain when I take cocao ? And what does it indicate, can I work out from this what my problem is ?There's too much information about depression and the different reasons behind it , so hard to find out what my specific issue is.. I really want to see some kind of doctor who really knows what they're doing and can do tests and find out what's actually wrong with me , why I don't feel right and how to fix it.. I'm wondering if anyone here can help or share anything with me, seems it's the easiest place to find help and someone to share with.. Thanks for reading this if you did :) and please if you have anything to share don't hesitate.. ","1"
"I've been depressed for basically my whole life. Recently it's gotten bad again. I've gotten pretty damn good at hiding it from the world.

While everyone was still there. I feel like I've outed myself to all my friends. Now it's 5 a.m. and I can't sleep cause I'm thinking about the disaster that was me last night.

"Ive never done this before. My mother always taught me to keep personal life and problems to myself. I am 28 yrs old(male) and ive been feeling depressed for a while now but recently its becoming so crippling unbearable its hard for me not to break down all the time. Its a long story but i feel alittle background will help you understand how I feel.I have always been a happy go lucky kid. Never the cool kid but everyone loved me and i loved everyone. I always wanted to please everyone i could and somtimes i would purposly take the brunt of jokes to see someone else smile or happy. Maybe because i felt the pain of being sad and never wanted anyone to ever feel that way. Anyways, my dreams were always small. Have kids, raise a family, buy a house have a decent job and car. Basically all i ever wanted. Even when i was in my teens these were basically all of my main goals in life.Cutting to the chase somewhat. A girl i always had a crush on in middle and high school was my best friend. I was infactuated with her. Loved everything about her. I am hispanic and so is she. And i knew she always had this little spicy attitude to her but for the most part she was practically perfect in my eyes. No drugs, doesnt smoke, not a partier, doesnt drink unless socially and very family oriented. Eventually after high school i took a gamble and told her my feelings which she responded by sharing she had the same feelings for me. We started dating (in order to do so i had to basically destroy my life, story for a different time) and we were so inlove. I never felt so happy. Love making multiple times a day, every time our hands met i could feel goosebumps surging through my whole body. And that went on for about 10 months. Then we had a daughter. For the record i think being a father is the best thing i do in life. She is a great mother too. But down the road we started resenting each other. We knew we were essentially perfect for each other but our prides always made us butt heads. We started fighting so much our neighbors would complain about us over in the other apartment.Alot happened over the next few years like her cheating on me with my best friend aka her ex (once again anither time) but after a year breakup period we began dating again. We now have 3 kids. I dont kno if i truly ever knew the type of person she was but at this point she is so cruel its unbearable. I never met anyone more jealous in my life. Always asking me who im with and calling me every  10 minutes if i go out, thats if she ever lets me. Over 10 years of working at the same job she has created confrontation with atleast 70% of my female co workers, how im not fired yet because of it is beyond me. She gives me no respect and always talks at me instead of conversating with me. She loses her temper over very trivial bullshit and always end up screaming where our neighbors neighbors can hear. When she gets mad its like she forgets about our kids just becomes so cruel to the family, when she isnt in a bursting rage she is actually a great mother i must admit.I am def no saint but i always initially try to be respectful to her and talk to her and try to make us come to a solution to our arguments but never to any avail. I usually end up apologizing just to stop the usless fighting. 95% of our arguments essentially consist of me asking to be spoken to with respect and she overly upset about, i dunno, dirty dishes or laundry on floor or def about random women. Ive tried breaking up multiple times but she always threatens me with taking my kids from me or moving to a diff state or get about $800 in child support from me for every kid. She has done a few of these already in the past. She manipulates the courts so well and tbh im awful in court. (Btw i bring my daughters to school every morning and tuck them in at night. I need them in my life daily they r the only things keeping me from falling apart). Didnt mention this earlier but i always kept the relationship together in the beginning chapters cause i believe raising kids in one household like my parents did. Ive seen them fight and work it out so why couldnt i? Well thats what i use to think. So over time i gave her large assurances that i wanted to have a happly ever after and stop fighting. Our bank accounts are combined(she doesnt work), we have a 2015 nissan, we bought a house together in both our names. She basically has my life in her palm. Yet the fighting just keep getting worse. To the point we r both screaming at each other everyday.I feel like im steping on glass around her. She is upset about everything and anything. Shs says she hates me and wishes i was dead that i ruined her life daily. Tbh recently i met my breaking point and have been telling her the same. All i fight about is wanting her to talk to me calmy and with respect. Everyone we know thinks we r this perfect couple cause i always put on this front and we have so many successes.I recently started realizing im actually mad at myself for allowing myself to hand my life over so easily to another human being. My life is not my own but its honestly my fault. I now have a stable job, beautiful kids, great new car, amazing house and a family. I met all my goals i wanted in life and im so incredibly pained. I can not feel more sorrow then i do now. Im sad and hurt. This pain has become unbearable. Knowing im going to live the rest of my life like this or live in studio apartment barely seeing my kids for the rest of my life. I feel so depressed, i wanted to kill myself a few times but honestly i never would. Im to much of a pussy to do it and also ill never hurt my kids like that. But somtimes i just take a quick drive and breakdown so my kids dont see me sad. Im still that happy go lucky guy on the outside to everyone. But inside im in so much crippling sadness i can feel it physcially on my chest. Its embaressing, im a grown man  and all i want to do is fall on the floor curled up hoping somone would come save me. It saddens me deeply i might have to live another 40 years feeling the way i do now. It kinda feels like the time my grandma past away and i was so crushed. But this pain is amplified by 2 and i feel it everday, every hour.I dont think there is anything for me to do at this point but i was hoping writing this would relieve this swollen pain in my chest a bit. I guess i dont really need help but im feel glad someone else knows my story.","1"

"I've been having some slight medical issues, so I've been bedridden and not getting much done for the past few days. And, some days, I just take a series of naps, waking up at all hours of the night (for instance, I woke up about 4:30am, and it's now 5:00am, and I'm still exhausted).Yesterday, I had a huge feeling that I just wanted to go out and hang out with friends, like I used to, but I couldn't think of anyone I wanted to hang out with. That's when it really, officially hit me -- I have no actual friends. The only sort of ""social outlet"" I have is my work, where I talk with others sometimes. But, there's nobody that I hang out with in my day-to-day life. Not one.So, when I'm at home, in bed, feeling like crap, wishing I could get back to my old self and get my work done, I'm left to realize only one thing:Nobody is missing me right now.","1"
"This post isn't for sympathy but rather to hear your stories if you're in a similar position, your views on it and how you deal with it. I didn't have many friends in school and eventually I became used to being by myself. For the last few years I have absolutely loved my own company and still do many things alone. I've gone abroad many times by myself, had dinner watching the sun set over the mountains and have eaten at restaurants with my only company being street cats wanting food.  I'm now changing my life around and taking exams to get me on the path to my dream career. I don't have any form of parental support, friends who are uninterested in my journey and don't know I'm depressed, and an unsupportive partner. Even if I do well who will I celebrate with? For the first time in my life I actually feel lonely... I'm on medication but medication cannot change the fact I have no one being there when I fall or to celebrate with when I succeed...

"I'm under so much pressure right now that I feel I'm so done with everything. Not only having to finish college, I'm working to financially support myself, applying for grad school, and then have to live up to expectations of so many people around me. You know what, part of the reasons I'm applying for grad school overseas is to get away from my own family who always care for their own business and yell at each other all the time.But grad school application is not at all easy. As a college senior I'm still too green to decide on my research field, and every mentor of mine keeps telling me my essays are not deep enough, my performance should be improved to impress the admission commitees. They ask me what I can do to contribute to my future profs' work. I don't fuking know okay??? I know that I want to learn more, that's all. Is it a crime to not know what I can do for a research field???I can't give up. Really. I have to get out of this country right after graduating from college or my family will force me to get a job and get married. Yes but that's what my family will do.I can't give up.

"The ineternet has been my refuge, but lately there are two reasons I feel almost sick logging on. One is boredom: I'm bored. Nothing is interesting, and I just sit there reading or watching mindless things I happen across. I can't bring myself to use the internet for anything useful - I've thought about taking classes, but can't being myself to expend the effort, I don't know why.  The other is fear. That's the strangest and most bizarre. I'm coming down off some very odd obsessions, basically rejoining reality after a year or so. I mean, I'm usually off in some fantasy world, disconnected from what's going on in the world, but never so much as this. Along with coming out of that, I guess I've been trying to be more involved in the world, in life...and I end up overwhelmed. I never know what's true or not. There's argument and confusion around every corner on every issue. Ideals can't survive, or at least mine can't in the face of so many screaming that people like me are stupid and wrong. I don't know what to think, like, believe, want, or do. Some deeply held ideals and outlooks came close to dying - not because of evidence, so much, you can't really prove or disprove an abstract worldview. But just because of hearing so much to the opposite, I can't fight doubt. And yes, there are some other issues, trying to reevaluate beliefs, being wrong and feeling like more and more of a failure.And of course, that's to say nothing of constantly running into drama, bullying, the world going to hell (and being simultaneously inspired to do something, anything at all...and too empty and discouraged to bother) that I can't bring myself to look at it for very long. I hate myself for this - I feel like a coward, like I'm weak. I can try to tell myself at the very least I need a break from constant internal crises, time to recover and figure myself out again emotionally. In fact, I really like not logging on every day, or at least only occasionally. I feel so peaceful, if a bit bored, until I go online, then this sense of anxiety and emptiness sets it. I'm not sure what to do. I have no motivation, I'm bored, I'm nervous about everything, I'm lonely but want nothing to do with people. And I feel so empty and hollow I could die.","1"

"No matter how hard I try, people just hate me. Im the quiet girl in class, dont start talking unless spoken to. I do my shit and get good grades. It started off with my fake friends who ditched my birthday plans. So I cut them off, it was easy to anyways because highschool had separated us. But I kept them on Snapchat incase I was going to get classes with them senior year (because that would be awkward to deal with) , well it didnt happen so I guess I can remove them all. I try to be friendly at school, but then they go off with other people. So I fell into videogames. Its the best escape I could ever ask for in life, as far as I know lol. I gained people I consider friends, but it hasnt really been going well since, I hurt them all. Im not kidding when I say all the friends Ive made online just tried to go after a relationship. So the cycle was always: become friends, they ask you out, I say no, and we just fade apart. P.s I have only met 3 girls online and they all hate me because guys go after me.. even though it just happens and the only way I can stop it is just stop talking to guys in general. So Ive only kept the 2 online friends that respect me and my current (yes I really dug my own grave) online relationship.My father knows about my sad life. He doesnt approve and doesnt consider the people I meet online are friends. I even had a mental breakdown in front of him revealing how shitty school life was and how alone I felt in the real world. How I would just do my work, and look forward to video games because it made me feel better. He just told me he didnt know what to say and that was it. I feel. As if it would be better if I didnt coexist with people at all. I could never get hurt that way. ","1"

"I have a friend who I really like and he told me that he is suicidal.

What do I say when he tells me he wants to die? What do I do if he asks me about the purpose of life? Because I really don't know, I have the same problem.Right now, the plan is to bake some awesome cookies and spare them in an emergency can, be the cheerful friend as best as I can (it's hard for me sometimes) and bring a movie when he asks me to come. To tell him ""let's talk if you want or just watch the movie and when you want to talk press stop.But what if he can't stop thinking about suicide when I'm there?

"First off, I'm not the most grammatically correct or articulate, so forgive me.My wife and I have been married for three years and together four, and we love each other dearly. She is 23 and was 19, still living at her step mom and dad's when we met. We dated for a while and she moved in. I was in college, but had a part time job good enough to keep us afloat, but barely. She had a myriad of problems that I learned about. All mental, such as depression, anxiety, etc. Her step mom didn't believe in doctors and refused to help her. A long story short, after all if these years, multiple doctors and a misdiagnosis of bipolar disorder, she finally has the right medication. She found a job a little over a month ago and it is a decent one. One that she can make a career out of, plus she enjoys it. This is the first job she's ever been able to hold and I couldn't be more proud of her. I had to transfer to a four year school and graduated last May. Since then I've been jobless. I can't find anything with my degree. Also, I've been very depressed for years and I've never been able to see a doctor foe myself. All of the money went to her doctors and medication. We simply don't have the money for me to see one anymore. All of these years I worked and worked to help her get to where she is. To help her get medicine, a vehicle, a career, an apartment, and a good life. She has worked her butt off and it payed off.But now I have nothing left. I'm depressed. So much so that I can't hardly force myself out of bed. I'm unemployed, student loans are piling, she is taking care of me and paying all of the bills alone. I have no motivation, no will, to do anything and we can't afford a doctor. We have one vehicle and there are no free or reduced cost clinics near us that are even worth it, as she went to the only one and we got her out of there fast. That place was awful. She is paying for everything, and if I wasn't here, if I left, she would financially fine. After all of these years she is finally self sufficient, and now I'm dead weight. I can't get out of my own head.She would actually have more money if I divorced her. If I left and tried to stay with my mom until I found some other job. My wife would be successfully without me, and I feel like a 25 year old bum. I simply can't do anything. I feel so weighed down with no direction, no motivation, no way of getting help.Also, the depression isn't just now rearing its ugly head. I've been depressed since I was a teen, but my mother's answer for it was to simply ""Get over it cause it ain't gettin' no better."" What do I do?","1"

The prospect of being alone forever is depressing. I go to college, ive joined clubs, i take care of myself. I follow all the generic tips people give me online. Nothing, not a single smile.

"I dont know if this is the right place to post this, but it is making me very depressed so I figured it was suitable. I am a maintenance worker at the retirement home my grandma lives at. I am 24 and I have been in the construction industry for a few years, so Im not new to the trades, but by no means do I know everything. I still have lots and lots to learn. A lot of people assume I got hired because my grandma lives here so it was a conflict of interest, but really it cant only be that, I am licensed and certified in heating and air, which is what they needed someone knowledgeable in his field in the maintenance department, so I demonstrated my skills in the interviews and I was hired. Anyway, I have worked here for about 10 months now, and there is this older Mexican man we will call him M, and M has worked here for around 8 Years and he is in his 40s and he is highly skilled and knowledgeable about anything construction or maintenance related. He is what is causing my depression. Instead of trying to teach me things when I cant figure something out he tells me figure it out on your own, thats how you grow up anyways. And he walks away. He says this so much so to the point where now I fear even asking for help because he talks down to me like this. It seems as though he is constantly trying to undermine me. I dont know why because I have always tried to be nice to him, nothing else. For example, this happened just yesterday on our lunch break. We have another third coworker in our maintenance department we will call him Q. Q is about 30 and he is much more skilled and knowledgeable than me, but no where near as much of an expert as M. Q has grown to become one of my bestest of friends over the past 10 months so much so that I would want him to stand by my side in my wedding next year. He always has my back, like I wish M did. Anyways, yesterday at lunch M said, I once got called in to work at 3am when I was on-call. And Q responded, What?! 3am?! Man, I have to go to sleep at some point so my phone is on silent at that point in the night. And, all I did was agree with Q and say that thats crazy. So Q has been working here for 3-4 Years so he is much closer with M and M doesnt try to undermine Q like he does me. So, M went to upper management and said that I said that I wont answer the phone after a certain time when Im on call because my phone is on silent and I want to sleep, when in reality I am not the one that said that, Q said it, M was just trying to undermine me and make me look bad to management. So, yesterday before I left work, management came to me and told me to remember you have to have your phone not on silent when you are on call in case there is an emergency and we need you here. You can get written up if you do not answer your phone and you are on call, because that means that someone else has to go in to cover for you when its your turn to be on call. I tried to explain myself that I was not the one that said that I was just really a by standard, but they really didnt believe me because M has been there for 8 Years and I have been here for 10 months of course they will have his back over mine. So I dont get what his problem is with me. M is constantly pulling things like this and micromanaging me and not helping me when I am trying to understand something new and need help. When I need him he is not there but when I dont need him he is micro managing me and undermining me. He is causing some serious depression in my life and I am considering quitting my job. What do you think I should do? Ive tried talking to him and management. I want this all to end and I really just want to quit, but this job is such a great job the benefits are not comparable to any other work place and the pay is amazing not to mention this is where my only living grand parent lives and I would hate to have to explain why I quit to her. Please offer me some suggestions. Thank you for reading my story!","1"

"I was on a certain medication for about a year now and unfortunately just realized it wasn't helping due to the way life was going. I kept thinking ""well the medicine isn't supposed to help (this personal thing), it just supposed to help with my general depression."" Meaning it wasn't supposed to help me feel better when a family member died or I went through a break up or was in a shitty job. I'm currently off of any medication, not because I'm doing better but because of other reasons and I've noticed something. I've had to relearn how to react to emotions. I've been so...blunted and dull for a year. For instance (the good) I find myself laughing at a lot more things. Like seeing something funny elicits more of an emotion than ""-heavy exhale- that's funny"" and ""touching"" things are effecting me more too but I'm also dealing with how to feel frustrated again. Like every small thing I almost lash out. I was wondering if anyone else has had this experience or is there more going on here","1"

"Last night I sent an email to the information officer at my school mentioning my suicidal thoughts and how Id appreciate the counselors email. Today I woke up to find out the police had called my work, my girlfriends work, and they had gone to my girlfriends grandmothers house where we use to live to try and find me. I found my phone and saw a missed call and dialed that number thinking it could only be the police trying to reach me. The officer on the phone was very frustrated that I was feeling depressed and tried to ask for help. He sounded like he just wanted to have a squad car come to my apartment and arrest me. They actually did come to house, but I had already gone to work. So now not only do my new neighbors think we have issues with the police, but my girlfriends coworkers, grandmother, and my coworkers are all asking questions making assumptions ranging from domestic abuse to drug charges. Id like to personally thank my school and the police for handling this situation with upmost care.

"I've been dealing with depression for about 4 years now.. see a psychiatrist, take medication... and at times like most, I have my highs and my lows. Recently I lost my job due to my depression impacting my work performance and that took a bit of a blow on my self confidence... Granted I didn't really feel happy at the job but I would have liked to have left on my own terms. It's just hard when you feel like you have no one to talk to or when no one understands what depression really is. They all think oh just do something fun or force yourself to do thing and you'll be fine.. no depression is more than being sad or being anxious.. I feel like I'm just stuck with where I am... I'm 26 and I feel lost, like I don't know what to do with my life while I watch everyone else improving and doing things that'll push them ahead and I'm stuck playing video games... even that doesn't really make me happy anymore. I admit I don't have any hobbies and I don't even know where to start... I don't even know what I like anymore. I wake up and I feel this pressure in my head, scared, wondering if I'm going to sink into an episode of depression again.. I try to force myself to just do normal things but after losing my job it's just like I have all this open time and I have no idea what to do. I've been applying for jobs of course, but very non-chalantly...as if Though I just don't know. I feel like I can't go to my friends to talk about things or my family because I've bothered them enough with my issues and that's what hurts so much when you feel like you have no one you can turn to and talk to... like you're slowly burning all your bridges and relationships because you don't know what to do... that's basically why I decided to write this and post here.. Just to let some of it off my mind and seek advice when you feel like you're just stuck...","1"

"I have no friends, no family member to lean on or to ask for help, even my online buddies dont even bother messaging me. My mom and dad resents me so much, she favors my twin and my little sister is doing way better than me in everything. All I wanna do is make them proud and be acknowledged but I suffer from extreme anxiety and being depressed and I dont know what to do or where to begin to get myself back on track. Tomorrow extended family is visiting, I dont want to be here while they ask me what I'm doing with my life or even wonder where I'll live once they move to Arizona next year. My only choices are with guys who think of me as sexual objects or become homeless because no one will take me in. I dont know what to do. I feel like I ruined everything when I had so much going for me. All I do sleep, wait for the next day to begin and the same cycle begins. I dont want to live like this but I don't have any money to move on my own, no way to support myself to go back to college. I just want to make a change or have something to work for but all I have is nothing, absolutely nothing. I'm tired. I'm too ashame to ask for help, even with my healthcare still available for the time being. I feel so alone, I just want to be strong and not weak anymore.","1"
"Im a 16 year old girl currently doing online schooling after leaving public school last year because I couldnt even bring myself get out of bed in the morning. I didnt keep in touch with any of my friends and now Im all alone and spend my time in bed on the Internet. All I want to do is sleep forever. I get obsessed with small things like tv shows or celebrities to keep myself going and spend all my time thinking about them instead of dealing with the reality of wanting to die every day. I get obsessed with the idea of being in a relationship and having someone who cares about me which is so stupid but I cant help it. I just want to feel less alone. Im missing out on doing all the dumb shit that teenagers do and Im ruining my education. I just barely passed 10th grade. I cant help but think it would just be easier to end it all. ","1"
"(Sorry. May contain some grammar errors as English is not my first language)I met her when I was 8 years old. She's also from my hometown. We went to same school. Gradually we became friends. By the age of 14, I started considering her one of my two best friends. She was a genius girl and I was an average student. I can't exactly remember when I got the feeling 'she's the one for me', but it happened when I was around 16. She must have felt the same way. Suddenly our relationship got changed. The friend turned herself in to a shy girl around me. We became the 'unofficial couple', though I never asked her out.She was the bright, studious girl in our school, and I was not good at studies compared to her. I wanted to be a somewhat valuable boyfriend to her than just being an average guy. So I decided to work on my goals. I started focusing on my studies more than ever. I achieved first rank 5 times in the final 6 exams. We faced the Advanced Level exam (somewhat equal to the SAT in the US) She got selected to the engineering degree, but I wasn't lucky enough get selected for the medicine degree course. I wanted to get selected just to impress her. I worked as hard as I can, and got selected in the next attempt after an year.On the first day of medical school, I asked her out, and she said ""No""!I learned that she had found a boyfriend in the year I haven't been in touch with her.I was shocked hearing that. There isn't any fault of her, but I felt myself useless. I felt all my hard work went in vein. I may have overestimated myself. I wished her good luck and left.Since then my life has become a living hell. I determined not to interfere her relationship. I wanted get myself distanced from her.That happened two years ago. I still feel depressed. I have no interest in studies now. I continuously failed all subjects in the medical school, and missed two batches. Next exam is my last chance to survive, but I have no interest. I felt suicidal several times.I met my college psychiatrist last year, discussed with her about my lack of interest in studies and suicidal thoughts. But I avoided telling her about my friend as I felt uneasy with discussing it with her, and also it might become long and boring. She prescribed me 100mg dose of sertraline. After few months having breathing exercises and antidepressants my treatments ended.I tried to text her few times, but she doesn't seem to be interested in having a conversation with me. Most conversations are limited to few lines, and even for that she responded after days.I don't know what to do now. My best friend has become a total stranger for me now. She is getting her degree end of this year, and I am struggling to pass my first year exam.It's okay that I'm not a good option to be a good boyfriend, but I don't know why I lost her as my best friend. At least I just want to be around her. I have no target in my life as I had few years ago. I didn't let her know about my failures and treatments as she would think that I'm trying to gain sympathy. Help me.","1"

To fix that I tried to understand who I was, thinking ""if I know who I am, then I wouldn't mind what they're thinking of me"" and then I realized that  am a dumb lazy loser. All I've been doing for the past 3 years in college was waking up, getting fucked up or waste my time with video games or watching tv shows, and going to sleep. And working on my assignments the very last minute. Every time I tell myself that I'm going to change, it does not happen. Because I'm a dumb lazy fuck that can't get anything done. When I goto work, people try to conversation with me. But my mind always go blank, laughing off whatever they say. What is wrong with me?

"  Im in my early 20s trying to get my life together. My parents are divorced and i currently live my dad(whom i believe is a narcissist). For as long as i can remember hes never been there for me emotionally, yeah hes around for birthdays and some holidays but we never really bonded other than that besides the occasional movie.  Hes been engaged to different women 3 times and each one ended within a year due to his commitment issues which makes me sick but i think has made an impact in my dating life because i cant seem to hold a long relationship. He sends me to grab him food(including his girlfriend who is my age), drive my grandma around, and do house maintenance. I dont mind doing any of this, i understand i live under his house so i must abide by his rules but i feel like its a bit much. He sits in his office all day doing work and everything in the house is my problem. He even makes me babysit my sister for hours while hes working(which he did to me when i was younger) like he cant be bothered with watching her for more than a couple hours so he throws her at me or my grandma. My sister(3 years old) just cries the whole time cause he wont play/watch her(this is mostly on weekends, shes at her mothers on weekdays). Im afraid because of this my sister is going to end up the way i am with my father and end up resenting him in a way. I just feel used and like an object to him, and i cant talk to him about it because we just dont have that relationship. But i do get my privacy in this house which i love, Ive grown to isolate myself.  My mom on the other hand has remarried and has 3 girls that i love to death but honestly Im not that good with kids. My mother wasnt always there for me when i was younger but now that she has all these kids shes much better and really tries to talk an connect with my which i love. But i cant open up to her about me being depressed. Id love to move in with her but i would get no privacy at all.   Ive dropped out of College twice and recently took out a student loan to go back now that Im serious about it . I had a really bad anxiety attack about a month ago and i spent all day thinking about where Im going with my life. I want to turn it around so bad but i feel so overwhelmed. I feel like Im letting everyone down, they had such high hopes for me and dropping out twice makes me feel like shit and i cant stop think about it . I want to be a better Son/brother and make them proud but i just feel worthless and it makes me unmotivated. I also used to be really good at holding down a job, i had a job for 2 years and another for a year but now i can barely hold one for 4 months because every job just seems unfulfilling and a waste of time...i dont know what Im doing but i know i want to go back to school to feel a sense of purpose....   Basically i feel like a burden to everyone and telling them Im depressed to me feels like i would be burdening then even more. I can barely have a conversation with people anymore because i feel like i dont have anything accomplished in life and Im a waste of space. I literally just play video games now to get everything off my mind until next semester starts. Sorry for the rant, i had to get it out somewhere","1"
"I don't like very many of the people in my life right now - in this individual moment - and I know I'll look past it in a few hours, or days, or whatever; I feel like this is a moment of clarity, though, unobscured by the apologies of emotion. I don't like the way these people treat me, and I like even less the way I know they think about me, the way they talk about me when I'm not around. I feel like I'm just a joke to them, like they keep me around to laugh about. Or at.I've been rather disillusioned with the concept of ""people"" and having them in my life at all for quite a while, and things are just getting worse and worse and worse. I can't even keep up the pretense anymore. People ask me what's wrong when I'm around because I'm just too tired for the fucking charade, and they don't understand when I tell them that there's nothing wrong - that this is just me, that who they know isn't, because I just don't care enough to even attempt to appease them anymore. I really couldn't care less.I'm unlikable, and I'm okay with it. I don't want to be liked anymore. I don't want people in my life. I don't want to want people in my life.

"Im a full time college student, and today has honestly been a good day, for the record.   I got an offer to work as a tutor next semester, and I found out that next week I dont have to take one of my finals due to the fact that I had an A.  I have a new job that pays well, and every physical need in my life is taken care of.  In spite of that, last week I managed to get into hot water with my parents due to falling asleep in church and being generally ungrateful.  On my back to my apartment from their place, I fell asleep behind the wheel of my car and nearly ran it off the road.  The police stopped me, and thankfully didnt ticket me.  Up until today this week,  due to those events Ive felt like a spectacular failure.  Tonight, I went out with a group of friends from a recreational club for an end of the semester dinner, and I left early.   There were two reasons for this, the first being that I saw myself in the mirror again, and remembered how much weight Ive gained this semester from a poor diet and lack of exercise.   The second thing that caused me to want to leave was my inability to interact with anyone.  I saw a friend of mine and a girl that I had tried to date earlier in the semester really hitting it off, and everyone else at the table seemed to be laughing and enjoying each others company.  I just couldnt do it.   I dont know why I couldnt, because I really wanted to.  I wanted to be part of that, but I just cant be fun.  I think both my weight issues and social problems are both causes for my inability to find a partner, which is something thats bothered me since my freshman year of high school.  Even if I managed to get into shape, which I have no confidence that I will given how late I am in my life at this point, I just dont have the personality to keep someone else entertained and happy enough to stay with me.  I have a lot to be thankful for, so I think its wrong of me to even be complaining about this, but my parents and friends are probably sick of the whining.  I dont know who else to talk to right now.  ","1"

"Throwaway account. Things that are contributing to my depression:- I'm a 19 year old female studying full-time at my local community college, due to my inability to work because of my busy school schedule, my boyfriend (21) had to pick up a 50/hr a week job with a one hour commute in order to support us, So he's gone now for 14/15 hours a day 4 days a week, 16/17 hours if there is really bad traffic. I barely see him now. He contributes to a lot of my happiness. - I'm going for a doctorate so I won't even be done with school until I'm 27, and then I'll have to deal with several thousands dollars in student loan debt. I feel such an immense amount of pressure to have a showy career and make an overwhelming amount of money because I grew up incredibly poor with a broken family, in which my dinners either consisted of a handful of otter pops or a $1 Mr.P's pizza split between my two siblings and I. - My boyfriend and I have been together for four years now and were considering eloping next year or the year after, and now I'm scared that i'll get cut off from fafsa If we do so, because it'll change my status to an independent.  - I have no ""girl-friends"", I have tried everything, friendsmatch,  girlfriendsocial, not4dating, strictly platonic forum on craigslist, local subreddits. Nothing has worked. - I have no health insurance, constantly fearful that i'm sick or dying and have no idea. - Sometimes the only ways to get me out of suicidal thoughts is to place myself in a daydream where I have endless money and nothing to worry about, I find myself living in these fantasies more and more lately. - Constantly struggling with anxiety and body dysmorphia, I'm thin now, but can't stop seeing the zit riddled fat kid in the mirror. - I'm growing increasing terrified of where I live, Someone has been stealing my mail for the last month, a man was murdered on my street a few weeks ago, and a hole was shot in my window with a BB gun, my only form of security is my German Shepherd. - The ever growing thought that all of this can go away if I just kill myself, or attempt to go off-grid. I'm terrified of dying, yet feel sometimes like it's the best option to avoid pain and disappointment. ","1"

I keep telling myself, I'll go running when I get home, but that never happens, because I'm just too mentally exhausted to do that. I've lost my interest in gaming, because that requires some form of thinking. I have no friends, or none I can go hang out with either.

"Sometimes it feels like it might be easier to live a life as a normal 9-5 zombie, plodding along to a job I despise deep down every day. I suppose in ways it would be nice to have a simple life, nothing too mad but to be able to take anything that comes to me. But at the same time although I don't know exactly what it is I definitely want to do with my life, I have multiple things I would love to be doing with myself.A few examples are marine biology, police, paramedics, Royal Navy or working in the TV/Film industry. I also weirdly enough like helping others and get at least some joy out of it despite not even being able to help myself. Despite all these ambitions I can't seem to get myself up to take action on them, I get myself hyped up and watch a few motivational videos to help but they only last for so long. I know not to be jealous but I can't help but look back on Facebook and seeing people from school who tormented me both physically and mentally as a kid doing extremely well, having good homes, money, etc, one of them just got lucky and happened to marry a footballer who plays for a smaller team but she has more money now than she can count and not a penny of it was worked for. I wish I did well in school, in life in general, I wish I wasn't a shell of my younger self who drinks way too much just to cope and give myself some sort of coping mechanism. I wish I was still like a kid, with barely any cares in the world, with the closest thing to real happiness I've ever known, I'm sorry to you, younger me.

"They make comments about being overwhelmed, and they've mentioned being seriously depressed in the past in an offhand way. They show a lot of concern for others who seem stressed or unhappy, the kind of concern that you just know comes from personal experience. They just have that look in their eyes like they're really suffering; a look I rarely see. But: they're the teacher and I'm the student. A subordinate. They're the kind of person who doesn't want to ""muddy the waters"" in any way, so professional relationships are strictly that. No jokes, no questions about family, no mentions of personal life, no discussions that are not related to work and in some form of meeting.

"But I want to share something that's fuckin me up.I got involved with a friend. We are very much alike and we've been attracted to each other for a while until we finally hook up. Now here's the deal: I have anxiety and haven't been able to talk to girls for a long long time, starting to get better just recently. This friend of mine was an exception to the rule and I was actually very open with her. After the first time we hooked up we were texting and I was panicking about her saying she liked that night and wanted to repeat, etc. I guess I feel a lot of pressure hearing this as if I've set some expectation that I can't live up to. So, since my brain was bailing out, I said maybe we shouldn't do it again so we could stay friends and don't ruin that. But I also said that it could happen if it was spontaneous (I guess this was a sane part of myself that knew I wanted it).Anyway, a lot of time went by and we hooked up again. The first time I was drunk and loose, but this time I was sober and it was absolutely great. We didn't talk about it for a while and when we did she told me she was seeing this guy that she really liked and whatever so, again we wouldn't be doing this regularly. But at that point we weren't thinking about doing it regularly, until one day we met and I was being too quiet and she noticed it. So without thinking I told her I really enjoyed kissing her and I wanted more. She had told me she feels very attracted to me and you liked to have me too. Stupid as I am, I told her I was confused because I couldn't see us as a couple and she agreed, but that wouldn't stop us from having a friends with benefits thing. Also she was still seeing that guy and all.As time goes by I begin to think more and more that we would actually be a great couple. We are the closest friends and we are sexually attracted, so why wouldn't it work? Now here's something I didn't know: a male friend we have in common actually hooks up with her occasionally too. I guess this shouldn't bother me since we never had anything serious, but man! Hearing him say they fucked was just a deep stab. And that just got me even more confused about how I feel towards her. I mean, I'm being jealous!I think I felt really disposable after knowing that I just another one of her friends that she uses for pleasure. But that thought doesn't add up to how we interact, me and her... I'm really confused.I had a lot more going on: not knowing what to do with my life, my anxiety got extremely worse to the point I can't eat anymore, I feel like my friends are drifting away and I have nobody to talk about anything, my family isn't the best... I also had a lot of suffering going on in my teenage years about love and relationships (friends included). Thanks thing with my friend was the final drop to release the tears I've been holding back for years.Today I woke up too early, shaking, feeling stomach pain and I just bursted in tears. I couldn't stop crying and I'm almost crying again while writing this.Sorry if it sounds like some bullshit drama, I really don't care right now, because I felt like I needed to get this out of my chest.Tl;Dr: I hooked up with a friend that hooks up with other friends and I got an avalanche of feelings added up to the feels soup. That made me wake up to cry, something I haven't done in years.EDIT: To be clear, that's a reeally compact version of what goes on in my brain. I guess many of you will know that since you probably experience similar things. This story is but a glimpse of what's behind it.","1"

I don't exactly have binge episodes but for probably five years now on a consistent basis I have forced myself to throw up food in order to lose weight or honestly, just to feel good. It's the only thing that makes me happy, like actually happy. I'm obviously suffering tooth problems but nothing severe. The only thing that makes me anxious is people finding out and they're starting to. I also have PTSD and a combination of other issues that make bulimia a convenient way out; the perfect evil as opposed to the other more horrible ones. How can I stop? I know I need to, but how? I don't even want to.","1"

"It started with a panic attack. Just one. No depression, no nothing just a perfectly reasonably stressed awkward lonely college freshman who overloaded on Starbucks. I always listen to what my doctor says so I cut the caffeine and started Celexa. He said the Celexa would help me relax but it made me feel like an amnesic soul recently transplanted into the wrong body. The feeling is unrelenting and haunts me as I write this.After the depersonalization began the depression became clinical where it has since stayed. I don't talk much and making friends among the self-absorbed crowds of undergrads from So Cal is hard, harder than regulating my emotions or understanding Hofstadter's books. The counseling center recommended clubs, I have tried some of them but no one seems to be able to start a club at this school without a politically correct socially just white guilt approved awareness agenda, and you know, that stuff just doesn't really make me feel better about myself-- sorry.My peers feel like... other people. Everyone feels like other people. I just want to be friends with good people but it's hard cause the good ones are so BUSY being good and getting their lives together while I'm... getting by? Hence the title. Lately I just want to read GEB, watch the Star Treks with Picard, noodle on my instruments, and get off on the sweet satisfaction of a perfectly rev matched double clutch into second that is so fine I don't even feel the synchro on the way in-- sorry.Waves of fine-ness come and go. I'll feel just okay for a few minutes here and there, a few days here and there. Those times are nice but I still have the depersonalization which is a CURSE FROM HELL-- sorry.On Monday I'm joining a depression/anxiety group on campus. I find it painful to listen to the helpless wails of other depressives but sometimes there someone in there who kind of sees it like I do and that's special.","1"

"Hey guys,Recently, I've become more and more isolated. I've been hanging out with friends less and less, as my best friend started dating the girl he's been crushing on for years, so he's been spending the majority of his time with her, and the rest of my friends have been curving me recently to hang out with each other. Because of this, I have basically ended up staying in except for going to class, work, church with my family, and visiting my girlfriend. All of this has taken a toll on me mentally, which as only been worsened by the time of year for me. Winter brings on my SAD, and it also triggers a lot of memories of some of the worst times of my life. I've just been feeling like I have nowhere to go, nothing to do, and no one to talk to. My girlfriend is amazing, but I always feel as if my problems would just be a huge burden on her, and she already has enough stressing her out right now that I don't want to make it worse. I don't really talk to my parents about it because, like with my girlfriend, they already have enough to stress about without me making it worse. I haven't felt this terrible in years and I was just starting to feel like I had finally escaped my depression this last year as I entered college, but now it seems like it's back with a vengeance. Sorry if this is a long read, I just really needed to get this out somewhere. Don't feel obligated to reply, but any sort of assistance is much appreciated.","1"

"Ill try to get right to the point with this. I suffer from depression, anxiety, and insomnia. I am alone most days and am pretty much confined to my bed, no school, work, or friends. Ive been seeing a therapist and considering different treatment, excluding medication, and have come to the realization that what I think is best for me is a support animal. I live in an apartment with my boyfriend and another couple who already have two dogs (max limit for animals stated in our lease) and another (secret) cat so I have been avoiding the idea of a support animal (trying to stay on good terms with landlord) until tonight. Tonight, in particular, was hard for me, sleep-wise, due to my boyfriend being sick and constantly getting up to vomit (tmi sorry). I finally was able to sleep after taking melatonin, but was woken by him several times and realized that I couldnt take it any longer (or the smell) and went to sleep on the couch. I realize that this is an asshole-ish move of me to abandon him while hes sick, but he does try to understand what Im going through and honestly, depression has turned me into a bit of a dick. Either way, I end up on the couch, unable to sleep, still, and start thinking those terrible thoughts (suicidal and all) about myself and my life that I always do and begin to feel INCREDIBLY alone. So alone, that Im almost to the breaking point, when I hear a door creak and see the cat hop onto the side of the couch and immediately run to my lap like she was sent from some Devine being to do so. I couldnt keep from bursting into tears. The immediate sense of relief that came over me was insane. She is still here by my side and hasnt left once since I started crying, but honestly I dont know if Id be here right now if she hadnt come..Anyway, Im thinking about suggesting a support animal as a kind of treatment to my therapist, but scared to do so because of how many people I know that have abused the system. I dont want to come off like that, but as bad as Ive been feeling lately, I want some sort of relief soon so I dont keep feeling like I had tonight before the kitty showed up. I need advice on what to do at this point. Suggestions? (Please be nice)","1"

"I graduated with a political science degree in August of 2016. During undergrad, I only worked at Target for 4 years and did an internship in youth advocacy.I graduated with a pretty good GPA, then got a job at a telecommunications company where I only made about 28k per year as a bottom of the barrel, entry level project manager.I spent eight months there until I was offered a job doing legal research for a real estate law firm where I was making nearly 40k per year...it only lasted for 4 months until I got fired for a number of reasons. My anxiety, poor communication at work, and the fact that people weren't buying houses in my area led to me losing my job.It's been three months. I temped at a warehouse for two months, but I'm finally back on my feet working for the state at my DHHR as a youth service worker. Once I finish training, I'll be making around 29k per year, only slightly more than I made at the telecom place...I'm happy that I'm on track now, but upset about the path I've taken in life. I always wanted to help people for a living and I've finally gotten the chance to do so. But the path I took to get here, and the things that I could have done better are haunting me. That, and all of the people my age and older who are saying that my degree is worthless, and that I should have gone to trade school...hey, my parents strongly encouraged me to go to college..I was on track to enlist in the military until my parents threw a fit :\Things aren't all bad. I'm medicated now. I manage my issues much better. I live on my own. But, I'm worried about the future. It'll take over a year until I get a chance at a raise. It'll take four years until I can become a licensed social worker, and two years until I'm offered any tuition reimbursement. I plan on going back to school. But man...right now, I still feel like I'm in the pits. I'm okay, I'm taking it day by day, but this is the worst depressive episode I've had since I lost my job in September.

We punish ourselves for pleasures though we are fated to die and be forgotten. The end is ever closer. Our existence, consciousness, is finite.

"Don't get me wrong, depression sucks. Depression can be dangerous. I don't know how to explain this. But my anxiety can be so intense, it makes it hard to breathe and it paralyzes me. Depression is different because for me it's like a heavy emptiness... a lack of everything. In contrast to anxiety, it's like an absence of feeling instead of intense feeling. Therefore I find it ""easier"" to stand depression than anxiety. Has anyone else thought of this?","1"

"Idk. Maybe I feel this way because I've come to not give a shit about things. The thought that I'll never get better, anything that us self-defeating, I don't see as a negative in my life. I don't think it's a bad thing to be isolated. I don't think it's inherently a bad thing to become destitute, homeless, or to give up. I don't think it's a bad thing to die, or to inconvenience others, or neglect them. I just legitimately feel like nothing matters. What sucks is nobody respects that kind if outlook. Somehow thinking and feeling this way is immature, sick, and wrong in the eyes of most people. Why is even saying that always associated with immature teenage angst? Why does this line of thinking always have to be intellectually written off by most people? Why does thinking this way have to mean you're just trying to hard to ""rebel from the norm"" and be and ""individual"" with the tone of ""I'mfifteenandthisisdeep""? Idk man. It has to do with stereotyping. I can't even type these words without thinking I come off as an angsty teenager, but that's not how I want to come off. I don't think refusing to fully accept and be happy with the way things are makes a person immature. ","1"
"It's not much but it's something.I'm lucky I live right next to a grocery store. Eventually hunger overpowers apathy (though sometimes it does take awhile). This time when I needed to get food, I decided fuck it, I've lived in this apartment a couple months now and I don't even know the area other than spots I drive to. Might as well go a bit extra since I feel so shitty.So, I threw in some headphones and took a walk for a few minutes before circling to the grocery store to grab some food. It wasn't far. It wasn't really all that much to look at. But it's a start and it made me feel a bit better.It's not some magic cure or something that even really means much but maybe someone will give this a shot too and it'll be a bit of a boost. Sometimes any sort of physical exertion you choose to do and fresh air can make a difference even if it's not much.","1"
"Hi all, I just wanted to let you all know Im rooting for every single one of you. I wanted to write this because my SO suffers with depression and social phobia and Ive realised how important it is to celebrate the small victories and not to punish yourself if you struggle. We never used to be able to go out to eat/drink together as he was struggling, couldnt attend any family occasions or celebrations as it was just too much for him. However, slowly but surely he is improving and weve done everything on that list :) I couldnt be happier.. but what Ive noticed is he still doesnt feel its enough or that hes improvingI think its really easy to assume sometimes once you accomplish something youve struggled with the rest will come easily, thats not the case though and thats ok!There are times he will struggle again and not be able to do those things even though he has done them once.. and I hate that he (or anyone else) would punish themselves for that. Depression is NOT your fault, and even if you accomplish something others may see as small, its a huge victory when struggling with such an illness. Im proud of my boyfriend and Im proud of all of you for fighting everyday. ","1"
"Hi, i never really saw myself doing this so it feels kinda weird to do.Since i was little i was left by both my mom and my dad.My dad left when he heard my mom was pregnant and my mom didn't wanted to take care of me so i had to live with my grandparents. I lived with (Only) them 7 years.Ever since that i always noticed things were not okay. Even when i was really small i was self-conscious of what was happening around me, i knew i did not had a dad, i knew my mom was mean (she would visit every now and then) and i knew my grandparents were just petting with me, treating me as a pet 'cause i was little, not because they actually liked me or wanted to spend time with me.Then things got better, we moved to a better house (An apartment) , my mom came back, i was happy for a little bit, that was until my mom left to live with one of her boyfriends, they would visit, when they were both drunk, and things like that, i remember once they took me to mcdonalds, when i came back i went to my room to show my mom one of my toys and when i came back she had already left with her boyfriend, she ran away from me.The same christmas of that year, i put a chemistry kit on my list, when it came i was super excited and happy, it was like my biggest wish, her boyfriend saw i was super happy and that my mom wasn't even paying attention to me and he said; i think i'm gonna leave, and my mom got mad at me she said i wish you were never born and she ran with him.Again, i was alone.one more year passed and i would see my mom once every month or something like that.She had a fight with her boyfriend, he cheated on her and i found myself on the middle of a house full of fights between her and my grandma, police had to come to separate them like 5 times... At that point i was just questioning why, i would cry on my pillow, or just try to forget about the situation, but the beef would always get to me and they would get me involved in some sort of way, once my grandma was trying to trow a knife at my mom and i jumped to try to get in the middle of it, i couldn't stop it, fortunately it didn't hit her but it was very traumatic to see all of those things happen.I was always bad at paying attention, all of those things made me just daydream a lot or just develop lack of attention to most of things.Although that... I always wanted to learn, i liked it, i could always get used to most of things without having to study them, just by practicing.After that it was just constant fights, every day for the next 5 years.I wanted a good school?No, go to a bad one.I wanted a good computer so i could play games?No, go outsideI wanted to go outside with some friends to some cool place?Nop, too expensiveI got to the point where my mom just sent me to a saturday highschool saying we can't afford a regular one aaand then she would buy fancy boots and clothes and go out, and everything, at that point i had to buy clothes from garage sells and she would get hers at the fanciest places at mall. I was always alone, i never talked to them since i didn't really felt comfortableThey would always treat me bad, make fun of me for saying an explanation, they would talk 'about a certain topic, and i would say oh yeah, it works like that, and they would say; no it works like this (nonsense) and they would make fun of me for getting the right answer, sometimes they would say is there something you don't know? mocking me and telling me to shut up.I tried different things, to accept my life, to just try to be like them, not to talk to them, everything... I just couldn't do anything.Right now i'm working and on college.And my mom wins x20 as me.I told her i needed help with college and i wanted to move somewhere else, since mxico does not have the best colleges and is not the safest place. She's just staying here because of some mxican guy she likes, sad thing is she doesn't even know him, it's a whatsapp boyfriend she met at some bad group of her work, he lives 12 hours away and he's cheat on her twice with her knowing 'about it. I tried to explain i always accepted everything and never complained, but i just needed help to find a better college; and she told me: No, stop telling me what to do, leave me live my life, i tried, i told her how i felt, how i wanted to get out of this country and she would just make fake jiggles, at some point i just couldn't contain myself, i was crying, i was not letting her get out of the door since she always does the same, she walks away and ignores me. she was pushing me and telling me i was crazy and worthless putting her face like 5 cms away from mine it's your problem, it's your problem then i said i'm your son, please help me you can't put a guy you just met 6 months ago before meand she jiggled hard on purpose, i got carried away and i did the movement of pushing her face away but did not touch her, she did a suprise noise and she was gonna start fake cry like she always does (she did that when she used to fight her mom numerous times) but then she noticed i didn't touch her so she did a dumb face and she keep repeating the same. The feeling of her trying to make me feel bad by fake crying, lying to me, laughing about her ruining my life just got me really mad, and i pushed (again not hit)  her face away, she did this horrible fake cry again and played offended for a bit, then afterwards she ran to her mom and dad's (Oh yeah, she's too bussy drinking and buying gucci boots to buy her own house) And she started telling her mom he hit me, he punches womans, he's so mean when all i wanted was her not to say those things in front of my face 'cause they were really really hurting me.3 days before this happened my grandma almost died, she drank a lot of pills, i had to break the door and go through a bathroom window to save her, when they came home they were acting like if nothing was happening, and my grandpa did not wanted to take them to the hospital, i got mad because it was a bad scenario, she was super bad, and he told me something like shut the fuck up you dumb shit I replied with What are you gonna do if i dont? he tried to scare me but as he saw i was not scared he said ok, remember this He's been treating me even worse than he used to.When this happened he came and told me to get out of his house, and that i was a worthless idiot.And now i feel bad and guilty because of that, because i would never ever solve problems with violence, i feel like the worst piece of human being.i just don't know what to do anymore, i've always felt bad 'bout my life,but i've always had hope on one time i'll go to college and i'll make my family proud but they don't even want to help me with that, i can't afford a private college on my own, and public colleges on here don't really give you much, i'm not learing anything and it's only valid on mxico,plus paying for transport is not that cheap on here, i can't even afford food. I've never talk about everything from the past with anyone, there's more, a lot more, but i just don't want to spend 3 hours trying to explain... I've always had hope, but now... I don't even know anymore, i don't see a good thing at all.sorry if my grammar is bad, i was still super shaky and nervous 'bout the situation.","1"

I still cry myself to sleep some nights being lonely. Why do I have to be like this, I don't know what else to do.","1"
"It seems I've been dealing with this shit my whole life and only recently have I began to see what is going on with me. It felt normal, it felt like who I was. Guess what though, it's not normal, its not me. I'm so god damn sick of feeling like absolute dog shit, day in and day out. Nothing ever seems to go my way and all I've done is blame myself for being such a piece of no good little shit. But its not me. This isnt me. At first I thought everyone felt the same way about themselves, as if this is just the way things go. I'm so sick of it, I really really am. I just want it to stop. I want it all to just stop, but nothing ever does. If I had any quick way to end it all, I wouldn't be here writing this.It's funny though isn't it? Everyone asks if you're okay but no one ever wants you to say ""Hey, you know what? No, I'm not okay, I'm actually pretty damn NOT okay right now."" No one ever really cares. It's so easy to just hide away from all that, give a little smile every once in a while, a little Ha Ha at some not so funny joke and everyone just assumes you're completely fine. At some point though the smiles and the Ha Ha's stop because its pointless. It's all pointless. Nothing ever really matters. I don't know what to do with my life anymore. Whatever interests I've had have all just vanished like the people who kept asking if I'm okay. I don't even have the desire to plan ahead because I honestly don't think I'm gonna make it as far as some people think. They keep saying that it'll be better out of school and when you're out in the real world and all that jazz. Will it though? Will it really be better? I have my doubts, you know why I have doubts? Because I don't even wanna go long enough to find out if it will be better. I just don't CARE. I can't wake up in the morning and suddenly choose to give a single flying fuck if anything will be better. I just want it to stop. The only thing that's stopping me is the little voice in my head, that's getting quieter and quieter, telling me that this isn't me. This is not normal. You are not okay. But its fading and I'm getting pretty scared.","1"

"Lost all my old friends due to mental illness. Finally made a friend a few weeks ago but they are super busy all the time so idk what to do.

It just seems so pointless despite remembering how good it felt.","1"
"At this point, I just have to laugh at the situation. It's good comedy. Someone's having a good fucking laugh up there.As may be the case with some of you, depression makes me extremely cognitively slow whilst at work. I do this thing where I sort of zone out when I'm forced to endure something I hate. I appear to be present to everyone around me, but consciously I'm really only half-there. I daydream. I've done it my whole life. I can't help it - it's as if it's an automatic defence mechanism. Through school and college and all of the jobs I've had, this has caused me problems.Now, as a 24-year-old man, I'm working as a waiter in a hotel restaurant. I haven't been there long and I don't plan to stay. I don't get on with anyone. All of the staff are quite a bit younger than I am and do not want anything to do with me. I have no self-esteem and I'm absolutely terrified of social interaction. I can't do anything to change it, so I just have to accept it. It's not how I want to be, but that's how it is. I keep my head down, and I don't bother anyone and I get treat like shit in return. I try my best to be content with that, but honestly, it's fucking awful.Very recently, this girl began to focus on me a little bit. It started with her just getting in my face and saying ""hiya"" in a stupid tone, in a blatant attempt to make me feel uncomfortable in front of the other staff. I don't know how to react to that. It did make me uncomfortable. Everyone's looking at me and expecting something back, but I just can't produce anything. I stand there and take it and desperately try to make it appear to have had no effect.Now it's at the point where she'll openly mock me in a room full of people whilst they all laugh. It's relentless. She'll tell people how slow and boring I am. I'll be called a ""fucking retard"" multiple times a day, she'll throw food in my hair and I'm pretty sure one time she spat in my lunch. It might sound like playful work banter, but it's not. And now a few others are joining in.With no one else to talk to, I told my mum about what was happening. It wasn't an easy conversation to have, and she couldn't decide whether or not I was being serious. ""So, a seventeen-year-old-girl is giving you shit at work? There must be something else the matter with you, that can't be it.""She seems to think that the bottom line of my problem is my ego. She says that only an ego is bruised by what people say. ""Ignore your ego, and you'll be fine.""To be honest, she's right. If I had no ego, none of this would bother me. Maybe I should just accept that I'm a little bitch who's terrified of talking to people. A man with nothing going for himself. Someone who'll never meet anyone, never have kids, and never be content with his life. Someone who deserves all of the shit that other people give him. Maybe that's who I am, and who I'll be until the day I die. If I accept that then none of this will hurt anymore.Sounds like a plan?","1"
"From start i would like to say sorry for my english its not my native language, and i really wanted to share my story to anyone.I have been suffering from depression for 5years now if not more. It all started when girl rejected me and i fall apart and givedup on my life, i just don't want to live since then. When i see couples holding hand i just start crying and something hurts inside me and i think in my mind ""This guy, what a life, what he done he lives it like it, he must be living a dream""(I'm a man to be exact 22) I never had any close relationship i have no friends not a single one to meet and spend time with. I don't leave my home to prevent seeing coupes kissing hugging and all this lovely unbelivelbly stuff. I can't sleep at nights i all the time go to sleep at 12PM and actually fall asleep at 4-5AM, in these hours i keep thinking how shitty my life is,none cares about it parents dont give a fuck even tho they know about that i have it. Now about the nights, i keep thinking about how wonderful it would be to have a girl to hold Her hands, to kiss Her, to talk to Her spend my whole life with Her give it to Her all of it, love as none else can, cry from happiness everytime i see Her, and most importantly hugs, thats my biggest dream of them all, to feel Her, Her body someone else touching me, actually feeling that i exist, someone do fucking care about me in this world i would hug Her deeply with pure love without faking it at all, then i sqeeze in my bed crying out loud and hugging my cover really hard like its Her. My dear love i will never have. Why? every time i see a girl i think 3 ways, either she must be in relationship already its worthless to try talk to Her, other way; Oh my She's so pretty and i keep staring at Her deeply with my ""love stare"" and they usually stare as well and it usually ends becouse of bus stops or something, last one, the worse of them all, at the beginning i already think ""Nah, she will reject me anyway im worthless and shit, not even worth a try"" Here is my story, deep down inside i have that feeling that a Girl that would love me as much as i love Her would cure my depression. Any thoughts? Should i even post this garbage here? ","1"

"What I mean by this is, I do plan on trying to get better... but only IF this thing happens to me first and the thing that needs to happen is not very likely to happen. And I can't make myself do this any differently.

I can't get myself to do any of this, unless something happens first. And that something has a 99% chance of not happening. I know people will say, just to do these things before hand whether or not this thing happens, but like I said before.. I can't get myself to do any of it unless it does happen.

"So I've been struggling on and off for a number of years with my mental health, generally this manifests in me eating and drinking too much, isolating myself when anxiety is particularly bad but on the whole I feel I mask things well and get on with it (I know this isn't heathy either). I have quite a responsible job, I manage people and deal with quite complex issues, it can be quite stressful. I've had a number of issues in my personal life over the years, I've been sexually assaulted amongst other things that aren't easy to deal with. I'm very close to my family and my mother has been sick with cancer over the last 18 months, we thought she was getting better after treatment but this week we found out the treatment hadn't worked so things aren't great.Apologies for the huge spiel above, the reason for posting is I feel I have hit breaking point. Yesterday with the stress around my mother I found myself driving on the wrong side of the road, I only moved over when a car was coming towards me, it wasn't intentional I was just suddenly, weirdly confused. Last night I reached a point I was just scratching at my hand to feel pain and want to do that now again. I have been prescribed sertraline before but been reluctant to take it, Inthink I'm going to give it another go. I'm sorry for this huge moan, I guess I want to know if others have done this, just want to be in bed, getting dangerously confused (me driving on the wrong side of the road) and wanting to cause myself pain (the scratching of my hand). Am I badly depressed? Anxious? Sorry.","1"

"I'm 19 and I started balding when I was around 18. It made me very depressed and disappointed due to the fact that it made me feel like it's wasting my youth. I used to be really happy because I didn't care about how I looked. Ever since I started balding, I began to look and examine my other imperfections very deeply. I started noticing that I have a weak jawline, a slightly big nose, and my lack of tall height (5'8). This obsession of not being able to stop thinking about my imperfections has made me insecure, which is now even giving me social anxiety. Whenever I walk around school, I start thinking about what other people think about me. It's really annoying because I start walking very weird when I have anxiety and it's quite embarrassing.I feel like I lost all of my social skills. Whenever a stranger approaches me and start talking to me, I start getting very nervous and my heart starts beating, and I usually respond with a very stupid answer that shows that I have anxiety.So how can I stop being so insecure? I'd like to beleive that I'm at least a 5.5 - 6/10 but my brain is telling me that being a 5.5 - 6/10 is not even good enough. I just wanna end this social anxiety and insecurity. I take so many videos of myself every day and start looking at my imperfections.I also started browsing r/truerateme and it made me feel like shitSo what can I do to stop being an insecure beta fuck with social anxiety?

"I used them twice before. I regret not using all of them at once. The first time I took them before bed and woke up with generic dizziness headache etc. It was honestly a terrible experience. The second time I went to bed crying after cutting and took about 3000 mg of my medicine. I don't think I'll ever forget the day. I woke up to a splatting noise. At first I ignored it but then I saw a little spider on my bed and freaked out. I flicked it away quickly but kept hearing splatting noises. Eventually I realized the spiders were dropping from my roof onto my bed and got out of bed instantly, threw everything in the wash machine, and tried playing games. But I noticed that I couldn't focus no matter how hard I tried. Everything blurred together and I couldn't keep track of anything I was doing. It kinda sucked because I had a league tournament that day and lost for my friends. But after I have up trying to play games, I went to make tea. My vision was going like crazy. Everything that was far away got closer and farther as I walked, and close things went farther. So sometimes is try grab onto something just to find out it's actually really far away and fall. My legs were also shaking to the point that they couldn't support me. First found out when I collapsed and banged my head. I went around the house on my knees and hands because I also needed to feel where things were since my vision was messed up. I would feel around and then slide in that direction. My heart was really heavy and rapidly beating too so I had a constant feeling of anxiety and panic. But after I made my tea and slowly crawled back downstairs, I just layed on the couch. My brother asked why I was out of my room and I just said I'm bored. I spent the entire day on the couch panicing except for when I lost the tournament. After the day was over I realized the  spiders were hallucination. Oh I also had a constant headache lolBut I still have about half those pills in my room. I really really wish I could swallow them all tonight and be promised death when I wake up. I want to do it tonight but thelast time I did it was just excruciating. I also want to hang myself so much. It seems so easy. But right now I can't. I still live with my dad and really feel bad for him. We've been through 3 different girls now and it all ended the same way. He s 47 now and I think he is just giving up. So he s really miserable because the 3rd just left a few days ago. When I move out though, I promise I'll do it. Nothing gets better everything is boring and my thigh is basically being colored by all the scars.Side bote: Hygiene doesn't help???? I have showed EVERYDAY except for weekends for the past couple years, brushed my teeth everyday since last year and even started doing sit ups and stuff before bed. It really hasn't changed a thing.

"Man no matter how strong you are, life just beats you down again and again. I'm feeling very lonely lately: - I've never had a GF, so this girl I met back in August, on our first date on Oct the 19th I got her some cupcakes and a book she wanted to read when I picked her up at the train station. On the way to drop her at her house I ran over a lady, whom is just fine, got out of the hospital 3 days later. - She stopped talking to me just because of that accident when we've been talking for 2 months, I wrote her a letter every day we didn't talk, 19 letters total. She didn't want them and blocked me from all media. I don't know what I did wrong, besides the event of running someone over, why didn't she stay? Not even after the letters I wrote? Not even after the book or the fact that I've been patient for 2 months to finally go out on a date with her? - She had mood swings on me via text messages even before we didn't meet and I tolerated that.- She forgot my birthday and I tolerated that.- She told me that the way she spoke to me through the phone is how she spoke to everyone, and I tolerated that.- I called her a friend once and she got pissed off, and I tolerated that. I felt real love, which is why it hurts so bad, I didn't get it from her but I gave and got nothing back.I feel alone on this.","1"

"The suicidal thoughts are not the worst part of the situation Ive been in for the last eight years. Nor is the Crohns disease. Or the anxiety. Or even the depression in general.

I just want someone to give me a hug. To tell me I matter and mean it. And yet, if even if I get those things (which is rare), its not enough. Its never enough. My twisted mind always finds some way to doubt it. Maybe they arent genuine. Maybe theyre just saying that. Why would a person as miserable and useless as me matter in the slightest to anyone other than perhaps my parents?And I know Im not alone. I know hundreds of thousands of people, probably more, feel the exact same way I do. I know I have a family who cares about me. I know I have friends, even though Im not close enough to any of them to talk about this stuff with. I know I have coworkers, and acquaintances, and friendly encounters, and social outings.

Before I begin though, I want to mention that I write fanfiction.

Where I can pretend that Im noticed, where I can pretend that people actually listen to me, where Im not a nobody that no one cares about. Now for the reason of this post:I talk to myself. A lot.I dont do this when there are other people in the room because I know that there actually isnt anyone there but when Im home alone, or in my room, I pretend there are other people there. I have conversations in my head, I talk quietly so that no one else in my house can hear me but I act as if there are people there with me. Even though I cant see anyone there and I know Im still alone, Ill look to an empty spot on the wall and talk as if theres someone there. The reason I mentioned the stories at the beginning of this post is because the people I pretend are there with me are the fandom characters I write about. Characters from Doctor Who, Supernatural, Sherlock, and Harry Potter.Am I crazy or am I really so lonely that Ive actually started pretending I have friends?","1"

"I've never gone to anyone for help or advice in my life because I've never felt like I had someone to go to so this is awkward for me and I want to keep it short, so this isn't going to be some long story just some sentences that do something I guess. (this part is a lie, I couldnt stop writing)I've always felt like my mom didnt care about me as much as my siblings. She's always saying I'm going to get rich one day and buy her a house and ingrained that into my brain as a child. As I grew older (now 15) I realized more things like that. I'm the only one of my siblings that actually has REAL chores, she always makes her problems my problems, and since I was a kid I've always felt the need to impress her. As I got older I couldn't keep up with her expectations as now I'm always in my room and keep to myself which shes always feels the need to throw in my face. When I cant keep up with my chores she always tells me how lazy and useless I am even though I'm the only one out of my two siblings that do anything. I will never forget one night when I came home from school and was just so exhausted that I went to sleep. Apparently while I was sleeping she told me to take down the laundry and do it (I have my own laundry basket and that basket she was referring to was the bathroom laundry) obviously I was unconscious and couldnt hear her. So at about 8:00 when she sees the basket still in the hallway, she burst into my room and starts yelling at me about how worthless I am and how I cant even do the laundry, she asked why did she even have children when they cant do anything. I get great grades, I do my homework, I keep my room clean, I try to keep up with my chores, but if I screw up just once, she lets me know. It got to the point where I would genuinely be scared when I heard her steps in the halls because I thought she was going to yell at me about something I didnt do.2016 she told me we were moving to a new town despite how much I begged her not to. She was stressed and took it out on me every time reminding me how little I did. On my birthday she didn't get me any gifts which I didn't see as much a problem because I understood she needed the money for the move, but she had the money to buy my brother an Xbox One just a few months later. For Christmas she spent at least $80 each on my siblings while I had a $20 PSN gift card hanging on the tree, I don't know why it didn't bother me at the time but looking back on it sucks. I know it's just materialistic things and I dont really care for those things anymore, but treat you children equally.A year later now that we were in a much better financial situation and moved into a new house I assumed everything would get better which it kinda did. She didn't burst out yelling at me as much but it still happened time to time. So now that my 15 birthday was coming up I wasn't really excited and I didn't know why. I felt awkward asking for anything just because over the years I didnt really receive much. I just generalized thing I would have liked to receive but nothing specific. When my birthday came around I once again didn't receive a gift. I thought it was going to be a surprise or something simple like going to a restaurant or something so I waited. The next day, nothing, maybe one more day? Nothing. And as days turned to weeks I realized I wasn't going to get anything. It may not seem like a big deal but when you see your siblings receiving things all the time and you get nothing, it really sucks. For a while I blamed myself thinking it was my fault for not being specific enough, but come on, at least buy your kid some McDonalds or something, anything at all really. What really got me pissed though was just the next week, she took my sister shopping and spent $150 on clothes while I'm sitting here with the same 8 outfits I've had since 8th grade. Since then I learned if you never ask for anything, which I never do, you'll never owe anyone anything, so hey I guess it's a bit of a learning experience?For a few months after that I tried not to care, and I cant describe it in words because this was years of being kicked down over and over again (metaphorically btw, she never hit me), so eventually you learn that if you dont care about somebody, they cant hurt you. This worked for a while but it was obvious to everyone in the house that I was being cold. I wouldnt talk or eat much, I'd NEVER ask for anything from anybody and I still dont to this day no matter what it is. Her one sided yelling at me turned into mutual arguments. She never realized how many times I walked into my room and just cried. I'd cry in the middle of the day and continue like nothing happened, I'd cry in the morning just before I got out of bed, I cried myself to sleep. I was crying because I knew how much I was being physiologically fucked and there was nothing I could do about it, this is how I will be my whole life, I wont get the chance to experience of feeling loved.One day after some stupid argument I went into my room and cried like usual but this time I didnt close my door and she came in. She said that she was going to kill herself. In the moment I hated myself for being a terrible child, like it was my fault, like I was the bad guy, I felt like shit, but now that I had time to sit and think about it, HOW THE HELL are you going to tell your child that it's THEIR fault that you want to die?? That ate me up for weeks and now not only was my mom putting me down, I was putting myself down. I've learned that if you put a smile on your face and pretend your happy, nobody will question why your sad. I do this all the time and I dont even try anymore, it's just an instinct to smile in every and any situation.Quick side story shortly after we moved into the house. We got a dog. She loved the dog when her boyfriend (technically my stepdad at this point) was around. She used to take out her anger on er boyfriend all the time and I was always the ONLY one in the house who would defend him, she used to get mad when I did but I couldnt help it, I understood exactly how he felt. Eventually they decided to take a break from each other because too many arguments and he moved to Florida for the winter. I didn't realize how much I cared about the guy but when I heard he left I was extremely sad. Now with him gone, she turned to the dog. If you dont want to continue on I understand, skip the next paragraph because it gets really messed up.This is the part where my ""not caring"" turned into hate. First she moved the dog from her room to the basement. A couple of times he would poop in the basement because we were at school and couldnt take him out obviously. She would build up anger for days and wait for the perfect excuse (the dog poop) for a release. She hit the fucking dog, not once, not twice, but every god damn time he pooped. It wasnt even discipline I was just her releasing anger. This truly fucking broke me. I was ok with her yelling at me, but the dog, he's defenseless, she was just pure evil. It got to the point where she build a wall of all the junk we had in the basement to lock him in a corner so he wouldnt poop anymore. I'm shaking just writing this part. I can tell you that it happened a lot when I was in the house, but I cannot tell you how much that dog when through when I was at school. One day when I heard her hit him from my room and hearing his whimper I just couldnt take it anymore, I ran downstairs and we got into one of the biggest arguments ever, which ended with her saying ""I'm the mother of this house, if you have a problem, you can move to the streets and see how long you last"" I moved him to the front porch with a little cardboard house, his bed, and his toys, she wouldnt go in there because she was scared there were mice.He eventually got ticks and lime disease and after taking him to the vet after my sister begged her, she didnt allow him in the house anymore and he couldnt stay outside as much like he used to. He needed extersize, he was a growing dog. One day, he broke a screen in the porch and got out into the woods overnight. He was attacked by a porcupine and had the quills in his nose. We took him to a vet but because my mom didnt want to pay she left him there. The vets saw how sad I was when we left and called her and said we could have him back, she said no. She PROMISED me that she would tell me about what was going to happen to him but yet I heard this over a phone call she had with a friend a week later. How can I trust anyone, when I cant even trust my own mother? I never told her I knew. She took away my family when we moved to a new state, she took away my friends when we moved to a new town, she took away the closest thing I had to a father figure I've had in years, and now she took away my dog. I guess it was for the best, hopefully he has a better home.Just a couple months later (present day) we are moving again. She acts like it's a surprise we cant afford the house despite the fact that I did the math and told her 2 years ago that we wouldn't be able to. The stress has gotten to her again and guess who shes been taking it out on. The reason I made this is because an hour ago she told me she doesnt care about me. I've been thinking about posting this forever now so here it is. I know in the beginning I said it was going to be short but I kinda just started writing and well look what I've gone and did. I was going to ask for help but writing this and sharing it for at least someone else to see has felt good enough. If you read this far, thank you and goodbye.","1"
"I just don't find the answer. I am not ready for this world. The slightest impulses I receive from other people cause my feelings to turn 180. I can not focus, lost in my own head. Nobody has the slightest clue. Just when I get home from school, a switch gets pulled that turns my life off. I have nothing to look forward to, I have no friends. The loneliness I experienced so many years of my life is pressuring my brain with permanent pain. I have got so much love to give. I am crying nearly every day. I cry right now. I am lost in a cycle where is the exit. I am craving for sadness because it marks another valley where it is just going uphill from. When I feel euphoric I just start to count the hours for something to push me down again. Even the awareness about that does't save me. I want to get hit by a bus so no one of my family has to blame themselves. But I also want to wait and see what life has left for me to torment and suffer. I want to suffer, thats what I'm good at.

"Anyone else ever, like, deny their depression? Like, for years, I have had depression, but I didn't really acknowledge it until recently. I would write stories and poems about self-harming and suicide, and I just said I had strong feelings about it. It wasn't until about a month ago that I actually realized that it was me fantasizing about what I wanted to do to myself. It really messed me up for a bit when I realized that.

"This will be really long & I don't expect anyone to actually read it but I truly have never had anyone to talk to about my depression and just need to get it all out there for once. So basically my depression started when I was like 10. I was very close to my grandparents and my grandpa died that year and it literally shattered my whole world. On top of this loss, my mom was married to a man who treated me terribly and was very verbally abusive. I absolutely HATED my life during this time and remember having suicidal thoughts when I was in junior high. Eventually when I was in high school they got divorced and things got better for a while. I still went through depressive episodes but I wasn't miserable all day, every day like I was when I was around my step dad. And then my mom left. So I was 16 and my mom started dating this guy she met on Facebook.... she told me & my brother that she was going to visit our grandma for the weekend and never came home. She called like 2 weeks later and said she had gotten married to this new guy, got a new job and they had gotten a place together. All in a town several hours away from the one where we lived. I took this very hard. I felt abandoned by both my parents (my dad was still in the picture but also moved to a town several hours away as soon as he and my mother divorced. He was in a previous marriage and had a son, who was also in a crappy situation. He fought in court for the rights to my brother and raised him on his own. I always felt like I didn't matter as much as my brother, because my dad knew what I was going through and how badly my step dad was treating me but didn't even try to get custody of me.). I felt like I wasn't good enough. It made no sense to me. Mothers are supposed to love their children unconditionally and have a special bond with them, so I didn't understand how mine could just up and leave me and not think she did anything wrong. After about 6 months of being incredibly hurt and depressed, like bawling every single night, I eventually just got pissed off at my mom and wanted nothing to do with her. My last years of high school I lived with just my brother, since both my parents moved away and left me since it was convenient for them. My brother is great and I loved living with him, but I still kept getting sad for what felt like no reason. My mom used to take Cymbalta and left like 5 bottles of it behind when she bolted, so I started taking those myself. I also started developing a lot of anxiety around this time and would take them when I felt anxious. They made me feel really sick so I eventually stopped, I don't even think they did anything for me. Same story when I moved away for college the next year. I would feel happy sometimes and then just sad for no reason. As bad as it sounds, I would sometimes wish I would get cancer or someone I loved would get killed just so I would have an actual reason to be sad. I also felt really guilty about leaving my brother. I know he genuinely didn't care, but I would cry and cry over it. I felt like he was the only person in my life who had never walked out on me, and then I walked out on him. After my freshman year of college, I transferred to a school 8 hours away. I really struggled to make friends my first semester and was depressed pretty much the entire time. Developed a binge eating disorder and gained like 30 lbs. Toward the end of the semester I started getting really bad about attending class, but was able to end up with decent grades because I had been going in the beginning. The next semester, I joined a sorority and I had a great experience. I made a lot of friends really quickly and was really happy for a while. Then over the summer, I stayed in my college town to work and go to summer school. I became friends with the people I worked with and started hanging out with them regularly too. There would still be the occasional night that I would get really sad and just want to stay in and sleep or cry, but it was less frequent. The fall semester of my junior year, I was a mess. I never went to class. I was in 2 regular classes and 2 online and I ended up just dropping both regular classes because I was failing them. So at that point I was only a half time student. I still had a lot of friends and was having fun, but was getting less and less motivated in school.That spring, my depression started taking over my life. I never went to class but I also always made excuses to not hang out with my friends. I would sleep all day long and stay up all night. I was binge eating again and it was worse than before. I would go through fast food lines and get 2 meals and eat both of them in my car so my roommates wouldn't see how much food I was eating. I hid my binge eating and depression from everyone. We had an on campus counseling center and every day I would lay in bed crying thinking about how much I needed to go there, but I could never get the courage to actually go. School was stressing me out so much and I didn't know how to handle it. I wouldn't go to class because I was depressed, then I would fall behind and school which would stress me out, then I would think about how much I fucked up my school life and would get even more depressed. At the very end of the semester I got out of my funk and somehow managed to get my shit together and pass my classes. I lied to and manipulated my professors to do it, but I did. I was also in a small major and all of the same people in my major were in ALL my classes. I did not fit in with them at all and hated them so much. I had no friends in my major and they were all rude/mean to me during class and group projects. I ended up switching majors to get away from those people. So again after that, things started getting better. I was aware of my depression so even though there were nights I didn't want to go out with my friends, I would force myself to just because I knew I would be sad later if I didn't. I also stopped binge eating, but had already gained another 30 lbs at this point. I hated the way I looked but didn't care enough to change it. By my last semester of college, I felt like I had things back under control. I was doing well in school and I was with my friends constantly. I hung out with them every chance I got because I knew this was the last time I was going to live in this town with all of them. I finished school and all was well. I was also interviewing for my literal dream job. I had applied in November and done 3 interviews for it by the time I graduated. It was a super competitive position and a lot of people applied for it, so I never even expected to make it to the first interview. I made it all the way to the final interview which was in February, and then I didn't get the job. I was literally crushed and felt like a complete failure. It was miserable to make it so far and then not get it. And then things have consistently nose dived since. I got into grad school in another state and originally planned on moving there. I wasn't too worried and figured I would make friends there and life would be okay again. My entire program can be completed online, so I let my family talk me into living at home. By this point my dad had retired from his job and he moved back to our hometown and so I lived with him since my mom was still gone. I HATE my hometown. It's super small, almost everyone here is racist, trashy, uneducated and just overall shitty. I had like 3 friends by the time I finished high school and they all either have babies or are in & out of prison- or both. I've tried hanging out with them a few times, but it's just so awkward because I've changed so much since high school. We took such different paths in life that I can't even relate to them anymore. Before I even applied to grad school, I was told it would take me a year to finish if I went full time and over the summer. Well turns out that's not true. The earliest I'll be able to finish is May 2019. Which means I have to live here another year and a half, on top of the past year I've spent in this shit hole. I cannot find a job here. I'm either overqualified or under-qualified for everything. I've even applied for shitty, minimum wage retail jobs and I haven't even gotten a call back. I've applied at at least 50 places in the past year and can seriously not get an interview from anyone... I don't understand what these people want. I have experience, I have education, I'm not a criminal. Idk why I can't get a job. And I feel like a loser because I don't work. I don't technically need a job because I don't have rent or bills since I live at home, but I have worked all through college and even had 2 jobs every summer since high school so I feel useless without one. And I feel like I'm disappointing my family. They keep telling me to get a job and I feel like they don't believe me when I tell them I've applied at all these places. My aunt even said I was just lazy once which really hurt my feelings. I've barely left my house or interacted with anyone I'm not related to in the last year. I just sit at home all day long on my laptop or sleep. I'm insanely bored and feel so isolated and lonely. I keep going in and out of really bad depressive states where I'm not taking care of myself and literally sleeping for like 16 hours a day. Things have ONCE AGAIN, been looking up. I started putting some effort into losing weight back in October and have lost 18 lbs since. I still have a lot left to lose, but the weightloss has given me something to work toward and look forward to. But I've started developing anxiety about my future. I've never had to be a ""real adult"" and I'm terrified I won't be able to find a job once I finish school. If I do, I'm scared I'll struggle financially and that will just trigger my depression more. I'm also 23 and I'm a virgin who's never been in a serious relationship. I had ""boyfriends"" in high school but they only ever lasted a few weeks and they were never anything memorable. I haven't kissed anyone since 2013... which was 4 years ago. I used to not be fat and didn't have trouble attracting guys, but I was super awkward around them so I never developed any relationships. Then once I started gaining weight, guys stopped paying attention to me. A lot of my friends are starting to get married and I just feel like I'm never going to be able to find love. I'm going to be 25 by the time I finish grad school and I don't even want to consider anyone from my hometown for a relationship. So I'll most likely not even look for a boyfriend until I move somewhere else. So I'm going to be a 25 year old virgin with literally no experience beyond kissing who has never been in a relationship. I feel like even when I lose the rest of my weight I will never be able to establish a good relationship with anyone because my inexperience is a turn off. Or if I do I feel like I'll be like 35 by the time I get married and too irrelevant in all my friends lives to even have bridesmaids. I'm writing all of this because I'm currently in a depressive state brought on by feeling excluded and unwanted by my college friends. I've REALLY struggled the last year adjusting to life after college and I feel like none of my friends have been there for me or even noticed or thought to ask. I was so close to these people whenever I lived in the same town as them and now that I'm gone it feels like I'm old news. I have one group of best friends and all 6 of them are currently in Las Vegas without me to celebrate one of their birthdays. I saw the bday girl posting about going to vegas on Twitter and commented on it, and was ignored totally. Then a week ago she texts me and invites me because someone else dropped out. Apparently she wanted to invited me but didn't have enough room in their Air BnB. I asked my family but they said it was too expensive so I couldn't go. Now they are all there and I keep seeing how much fun they're having while I'm laying alone in my bed crying and it just hurts so much. It hurt my feelings a lot that I was excluded and then only invited as a last resort. And it isn't even because I moved away, because 2 other girls in the group graduated and moved too and they were both invited. I'm literally the only one who was left out. And I don't understand why. Why me? Why am I the weakest link? Why am I always the one left out? It's even more frustrating to me because I'm constantly still doing things for my friends and sending them notes and gifts. I always put so much thought, effort and money into doing things for them even though I'm 8 hours away and I haven't ever gotten anything in return. I don't think I've had a single friend buy me a birthday gift, ever. Idk. It just makes me feel like I always care more about people than they care about me. Being the ONE person left out kind of justifies my depressive and anxious thoughts about being a burden on people or an annoyance to them. I feel so alone, so sad, so worthless and so miserable. I don't know if I can handle another year of this but I don't even know what I can do. I feel like all my life things have kept getting better then worse then better then worse again and that it'll never change.  ","1"

"I didn't realize until one of my friends was talking about sex, but today as of two years ago was the last time I had sex. I'm so miserable about because I have an insanely high sex drive. I've tried and tried to get over my dry spell and can't seem to do it. I thought getting a job and graduating would help, but nope. I thought changing my wardrobe wearing fitted clothing, and changing my hair style would help, but nope. Recently I got a puppy and thought it would help, but nope... (Note: I always wanted a puppy anyway, but still) I'm so miserable about it because I've come close, but either one thing or another it will not happen. I tried going out A LOT, tinder, bumble, bars, texting a bunch of girls on messenger, and sending mass Snapchat messages of my puppy, but it doesn't work. Man I really hate my life, also the fact that ALL my close friends have been in some relationship or had sex for the past two years just seems to rub it in my face more. I mean I love them to death, but sometimes I just hate hanging out with them because it just sucks how they are with their SO or some girl in heat wanting to get them by themselves already. Point is I'm a depressed fuck, and today marks two years if not getting any, and being single as a Pringle, and having trust issues because my last girlfriend cheated on me, I have a shit ton of family issues, and the only reason that keeps me alive is because I support my mom and now have a puppy that I love with all my heart. Lately I don't want to go to work anymore, I just want to stay in bed and do nothing because deep down I know everyone around me is gonna leave soon.my roommate graduates next semester, one of my favorite person to hangout is going 5 hours from where I live for PA school, my other close friend graduates next semester and leaves to Japan... I just have this feeling that soon enough I'm gonna be all alone with my dog, no one will love me, and all I wanted was to have sex, because regardless of people here say it's an amazing feeling, it's not overrated, and I would kill and die to have it again. Sorry if that's not helpful if you've never had it, or try to deny it, but that's the honest truth. Although this may apply if you have a really high libido, which I do, but because of it I've been miserable. I'm just gonna continue drinking til I pass out, and hopefully feel better tomorrow. Knowing my self I'll continue posting next week","1"

"I fucked up. i've longed for love my whole life, i had it months ago. I was blind and i told her off. She hates me with a passion now. I can almost remember the time she ""I used to love with every last breath, i had but now i can't even stand you"" That was what really threw me off into feeling alone. one of my homies before this was depressed about the girl he loved but couldn't get. That really made me feel his pain. I was too blind to realize it was true love coming from her, which i wanted. She even had her heart broken and gave it back to me. i was blind. She was sad about me, she got better and probably found someone else by the time. i realized i fucked up. She even told me wanted to date my cousin who i live with as a lie to break up with me. She lied about losing her virginity with another guy. Now I feel empty and i feel like thats the only thing that was  keeping me happy. my grades aren't good as they used to be. every time i see a couple, i cry inside.

"My friend is suicidal and plans to go through with it. I have tried doing everything in my fucking power to stop him from doing it, but in the end I don't even think any of it fucking mattered at all because he's going to do it anyways. I hate myself, and I almost hate him. And I hate that I sort of hate him because he is the one who is considering killing himself right now, not me. I have been trying to talk him out of it, trying to brighten up his day, crying, worrying when I should be studying for my finals, freaking out about losing a good friend, and basically turning into a nervous wreck. I'm starting to think that everyone will just leave me in some way for some reason because I'm not enough. I'm obviously not helping my friend enough, because if I was then he wouldn't be considering killing himself, right? I feel awful and guilty and terrible for even making this post because MY FUCKING FRIEND IS FUCKING CONSIDERING FUCKING KILLING HIMSELF but I just can't help but feel like I am being so god damned drained by this. My grades might suffer. My emotional state is definitely suffering. This is even starting to seep into my other relationships because I'm so worried and irritable and scared. I've cried myself to sleep for the last few nights because I'm probably going to lose a friend to suicide. A good friend, a friend that I feel very close to, a friend that I even consider an older brother of sorts. And I'm just so fucking drained by all of it. A part of me says ""You've done the best you can, and now you need to focus on your education, your future career, your other relationships, and yourself."" but the other part of me says ""Bullshit, you haven't done the best you can because if you did then he would be laughing right now and not crying."" My anxiety is bad enough as it is. He is dragging me down with him, whether he means to or not. Some of my friends tell me to keep him talking, but I don't know how much longer I can even do that. Others tell me to use psychological tools to help pull him back, but they backfire. I just don't know what to do. I don't know what to do. This is just a very long and very rambly post where I probably repeat what I say five times throughout the post but I'm too drained to even bother checking.

It makes me sad because it seems like I've got it all figured  out and then this feeling hits. Maybe it's loneliness kicking in? Or maybe I need a hobby? Does anyone else get this feeling?

I dont want to die but i dont want to live and see them together, trying my best to move on, sorry for rant - some of my pals helped me a bit by saying that it was fucked up and stuff but i dont even know i just want to get the hell out of here first chance i get hoping on a college far away and the worst part is he knew how crazy i was about her and he has a gf already i feel it is only to hurt me as he is a  manipulative individual ","1"
"I don't mean to sound selfish or overbearing. I'm just tired, think we all are.When my brother came to my birthday party, he was on his phone the whole time. Maybe looked up a couple of times. Today, I went to go talk to my Dad and I was trying to start a conversation, he noticed something he thought was interesting on the TV and put his headphones on, didn't even say anything to me.I went to talk to my Mom and I sat down and said hi. I tried to talk to her. She doesn't even say anything in response to me, she just types on the computer to her online friends who are more exciting. Doesn't matter that I'm there.On Thanksgiving, I was in the kitchen finishing up something I made. In that time, 15 mins, my whole family ate dinner without me and got up and went off to do something else. They didn't even eat what I made. I really dread Christmas. I was excited about making a special cake for everyone, but I don't think they care about my cakes and they'd probably be more satisfied if I bought one.If I didn't talk to them first, they never would message me. I think I'm really boring. I think they'd be happier if I just disappeared, or maybe if I just stood in the background and didn't say anything.","1"
"I have a 'very important and urgent project' to do at work. It involves managing and organizing a bunch of sub-projects and people. But instead of letting me do it the way I want and have done dozens of times and could easily do on a spreadsheet - that I worked late 2+ un-paid hours last night to set up. Today the owner wants me to use some new project management software because ""it will look better to the client"". So instead of actually doing any work, I'm learning how to use new software, reading and watching tutorials that I have to reread and rewatch because my fucking ADHD makes learning new shit hard. I've now got the presure of doing a challenging important task in ""rush"" situation - and now with a greater likelyhood of failing as I stumble through this new shit. I started out the day feeling if not happy, at least nutral. I'm now angry and depressed and my hand hurts from banging on my desk repeatedly almost hoping my hand or the desk would break. FUCK LIFE.

"I've been severely depressed all my life, and even though I'm a functioning adult (employed full time, in school, married), I feel like I'm at the end of my rope.  I feel like any little thing can set me off, and today something pretty trivial almost did.I sat on my couch all morning bawling my eyes out, thinking about how much of a fuck up I am, how nothing I do is right, no one appreciates me, I'm better off dead but scared to actually do it.  Then my husband gets home and flips out about me crying.  He's sick of seeing me depressed, and I understand that it's frustrating for him.  But swearing at me, saying that I'm my own worst enemy, saying ""fuck you"" to me doesn't help.  He got angry that I couldn't speak to him about what was wrong in between sobs, which made me sob harder.  I can't talk to him about it without feeling berated.  I see a therapist, and there has been little progress. I feel like I get worse and worse and am afraid that nothing will ever get better.  It has been 20 years of this deep sadness.  It's never going to go away.","1"

"I have done some research Googling but Im still ignorant about it but it seems like I have almost everything that goes along with depression including suicidal thoughts. For all of high school, I believed I didnt really have it because I thought everyone in some form has those thoughts and that I wasnt really depressed since I could still crack jokes and make people laugh,I have good people who call me their friends and my parents are making good money so I never have reason to complain about my situation at home but Im not too sure anymore. I first questioned it when Robin William died because while my jokes would never be comparable with the ones Robin told; I saw myself like him where I like to make other people happy by laughing and a person like that I thought would never have those thoughts on his mind until his death. Another thing was I thought my general sadness was from the fact that I was without a girlfriend in high school;it almost became the reason for my existence and once I got one in senior year,nothing changed at all. When it was good I felt the same and when she cheated on me I was angry on the outside but inside it just felt the same and after we broke up I was in the same spot I was in before emotionally. I told myself the feeling would go away after a good one because the last one was just a fluke but thinking now,I wouldnt get back together with my ex,no SO would just magically pull me from this. The last thing was when one of my friends started posting on Snapchat about her problems and I talked with her about it and I notice a difference between us; after like two days she dropped the stuff she was talking about and hasnt mention it since. Its been like a month or two and the only things she sends now are her out and about and with her friends. I on the other hand has been feeling like this since 6th grade and while I have moments where I dont think of it;it always comes back after that 10 second or 2 minute time is up. I never hope I would ever say I was depressed for attention either so I only told my mom,brother and my best friend from high school who thought it was funny which enforces the notion I wasnt really but then again reddit is a popular site where something on r/all has more upvotes than people I dare know in my lifetime so idk what Im really aiming for here. In reality my family and friends and my lack of courage might be the only reason why Im here right now but then again my friends would never believe I was truly depressed and my brother thinks Im just going along with trends that depression is edgy or the kill myself jokes similar to like me_irl which its hard to tell if its just jokes or jokes made in denial. I have never try to kill my self but theres been many occasions where I discarded my safety with my fingers cross that something would happen but my family and friends would never know about that its too small to remember. Theres also a stigma against mental illnesses which brother flat out admits its hard to believe someone close to him has but I seen a stat that 1/4 American has a mental illness of sorts and my nuclear family has four people and my parents and brother are normal in the head which honestly is the weakest part of my argument;but Ill call it an argument because I actually believe I am depressed but everyone else disagrees and its hard to decide who to listen to because who should understand my mind better than myself but then again I never really value my input/opinion to begin with.

"I live on a 1st floor so it was really close. A car hit a person really hard, I'm suprised the person was still alive when the ambulance came, although they reanimated him for quite a long time. I heard a huge noise and I saw an aftermath - didn't see the injured person, by I saw car driver trying to escape by forcing an entry to a random cab and a guy pulling him out of the car GTA style. I hear sirens all the time now. I saw some accidents before and I felt umm...kind of uneasy after each of them but now I really can't shake it off, and constant sirens arent making it better. I'm not really panicked but my heard is beating faster and I need a company. Normally I'm quite talkative and like to go into details but I need to share this asap so I'm not going into details of what happened right now, although any questions are welcomed. English is not my first language and it's possible I'll make some spelling mistakes when I'm nervous.This car driver's panic and ugh... it seemed like he was completely out of his senses. He thought he killed a man I guess. His panic and madness really stressed me for some reason, I imidately felt somatic symptoms like stomach pain when I saw that man right in front of my window.P.S There was a plenty of wintesses who saw it better then I did, there are also cameras here (probably) so police doesn't need me there.","1"

"I'm 20, going to my second year of university, and I've got no friends. I can't make new friends or maintain friendships with the ones I had from high school. My social skills are non-existent, a problem which has not only affected my social life negatively, but my professional one too. I'm too anxious to go speak to my professors, too shy to join any clubs or events, too scared to try and reach out to others. This negative feedback has cycled for the past four years, and I don't think I can escape it. I'm ugly, physically, and this fact alone is root of my social anxiety.   I hate myself, everything about myself, and my external appearance is the first domino in the chain. There have been days where I would cry for hours on end, thinking of my future, and how lonely it looks to be. Making a connection with people is exceedingly difficult, and at this point, I'm about ready to throw in the towel and stop trying all together as all my efforts thus far have not resulted in anything meaningfulI have not yet had any romantic relationships with anyone. I can't love myself so I don't expect anyone else to either.I'm slowly loosing any motivation to pursue my interests or hobbies. Life just seems so meaningless without people to share it with. That being said, I couldn't have asked for a better family. They're the reason why I haven't, and can't, kill myself. I don't want to hurt them, although I do think their lives would've been better off if another child had been born other than me.Fuck this life. Fuck my appearance. Fuck this crippling social anxiety. Fuck these thoughts. I just want to be loved and cared about, selfish as that may sound. ","1"
"I've been so confused lately. Emotionally. I don't know who I am as a person. I used to be this tender, compassionate guy that would always be there for people in time of need but that has changed.

"It's been 10 years. I was 15 when I first got depression. And for years and years, I fought it and tried to have a normal life. I fought so hard to work full time, go to university, support my SO. But I kept falling short, having mental breakdowns, and leaving jobs. I finally decided today that I'm going to stop fighting it.No, I'm not going to kill myself. I'm going to accept that my life might never be the normal life I've always wanted. I'm going to be moving to a smaller house. I'm in a casual work position so that I can work as much or as little as my depression and anxiety will let me. My SO is going to be getting a respectable promotion, and has agreed to become the breadwinner (so long as I use my spare time to keep myself as happy as I can.) I don't know what that means yet, but it could mean anything. Volunteering. Art. Music. Dog walking. Writing. Music lessons. Anything to help me from feeling like hurling myself off of a bridge.I know what a lot of you are thinking. ""Fuck this guy. He just gets to do whatever he wants to because he has someone to help support him."" Or, ""You can still do things you enjoy? You must have it easy."" Well, this isn't what I want. And maybe I can still do things I enjoy sometimes, but that doesn't change the running suicide commentary going through my head.  I want to go to work. I want to make lots of money and have a nice house. I want to be respected as a hard working person who contributes to society.  But my brain just isn't letting me. And as stupid as it sounds, I still think that the standard 40 hour work week with kids and a nice house is a waste of a good life...like I'm sure a lot of you think. But I still want it at the same time. It's funny how depression can make you feel like that. I don't want to be like everyone else, but I also do.Oddly enough, my SO is the exact opposite of me. She can't handle being at home on her own. Her depression explodes. She used to work in a seasonal trade, and would completely shut down when she was off in the winter. She breaks down when she's home alone on her days off. She has to be with friends, or doing something with me. It's kind of disgustingly perfect in a way. A lot of you are probably still snarling at me for having a seemingly great situation, but I can assure you that I'd love nothing more than to pluck this screaming illness from my head and move on. I don't like being suicidal every day. I don't like having crippling hypochondria. I don't like being scared to go into public. This is my nightmare, but I'm going to do my best with it.Part of me is relieved that I'm finally just accepting it and doing what I can, but part of me is absolutely distraught that it had to come like this. I feel like the special kid who could only come to class a couple days a week because he wasn't physically able. Except I feel like I'm worse because it's all in my head. I fucking hate it. But it's the only thing I can do right now.So yeah, I'm pretty damn lucky that I have this option. To work as I can. Of course, it comes with certain sacrifices. But I still have the option. It's weird though, because up until now, I thought ""man up and live like everyone else"" or ""kill yourself"" were the only two options. I guess I only have my SO to thank. That being said, I've had a tough couple of months, but dedicating half of my time to enjoying life, doing therapy, and learning new things has made the tough days worth fighting through. I'm letting the depression win, but I'm also boxing it in with the tools I have available to me. To be quite honest, if I didn't have my SO, I'd likely be doing this out of my parents basement. Or dead. But I'm using what I have.It's sobering and heart breaking to admit that you're a lost cause, but it can also be liberating. Heck, I might turn 30 and lose this depression all together, as unlikely as it is at this point, but for now I need to build my life around it. Because the other way was not working.I know not everyone is in the situation I'm in and that the world isn't built for people with brains like us, but I want to encourage everyone who has an idea in their head of what they wish their life would look like to try and come to terms with the fact that maybe you need to build a new life around what you have available to you. I spent every year since High School desperately trying to fit into this mould of a standard citizen, a mould that I HATED, but felt pressured into. Well guess what? That's never going to happen for me and I'm ok with it now. And I'm willing to do whatever it takes to adjust my life to it. I'm sure a lot of you are already past this stage too. Sitting in your parents basement or on social assistance. Or maybe even in my position. As to where we go from here, I'm not sure. But we can be there for each other at the very least. If anyone needs a friend, my inbox is always open. ","1"

"I'm one of those persons that can easily create new ""friendships"". I can get to a new environment and build a vast network within days. But rather than settling for a core group of friends, I rotate through several different groups. Rather than having quality friendships, I have quantity.I know everyone, but I don't really know anyone. And everyone knows me but no one really knows me. Even when I do form a ""core"" group of friends, I resist the idea of relying too much on anyone. Recently, I was starting to have a ""best friend"" but at some point I felt I was connecting too much with her and relying too much with her. So out of the blue I shut her out. And I walked away from her.On the one hand, rationalizing, I see this strategy as a very good way to not get hurt; to be stable; to be solid; to be strong. I don't need to rely on anyone, I'm self-sufficient. On the other hand, I also recognize that this probably isn't very healthy...What do you think?","1"

"(Disclaimer: This is essentially a rant. You probably won't care. I just need to talk somewhere, this is mostly a bunch of mindless babbling and complaining.)I'm not living the life I should, and I don't know what's wrong with me. I always get myself into fights I don't want to. I've inadvertently ruined friendships so badly that it sabotaged my reputation. I can't make or keep friends well and I've heard people only pretend to like me. I know I'm a fat lazy shit, everyone tells me so. I want to turn my life around, I really do. I just have zero motivation. I yell about how I want to go to the gym and get in shape. Guess how that's turned out. I say I want to go out more, but do I reach out to anyone to hang out? Not at all. I depend on my fake ass 'friends' to reach out to me (which happens about once in a blue moon). When I do go out, I totally lose control and act like a moron because the rest of my time is spent alone. I always end up wanting to go home within a few hours, and then crash hard. I'm probably just an introvert in denial, but it's the only time I feel truly alive. All I do is sit inside and masturbate and play video games and eat. I may leave the house once for some non-necessary (ie. not school or related things) once, maybe twice, and that's a good week.It doesn't make sense because I'm not always sad. Sometimes I'll go days at a time feeling fine, but then drop hard and spend the next couple days in a pit. It's practically a cycle. My feelings seem to manifest themselves as anger and hostility, I'll snap at people for damn near anything and need to control myself to ensure I don't. I pick fights I shouldn't. Yet despite this, I have low self esteem (yet, as mentioned before, skyrockets to being extremely egotistical around others, likely just hormonal teenager shit) and low confidence. I'm the most pessimistic guy anyone could ever meet and nobody can stand to have serious conversations with me because I'm so negative. I'm selfish, I'm hypocritical, I'm insensitive. I speak before I think, and it causes me loads of problems sometimes. I even think I'm an aspie, just to put salt in the wound.I dwell on the past. Every mistake I've made, every little superficial thing I've done wrong, I'll dwell on. It'll take me far longer than it should to accept nobody is perfect and that everybody does stupid things from time to time. For the few significant things I did, I never forgave myself for. It's been months, and I don't see it changing. I'm self critical and criticize others yet I'm sensitive when anyone says anything to me. I can't handle criticism, I take it as an insult. My mood changes so easily, yet I'm also extremely apathetic at the same time. My emotions have control over me. I don't make sense, I'm such a hypocrite. I fear my secrets will get out and I'll be totally ruined and lose everyone I still hang on to now. Does anyone even really like me, or are they just using me when they have nobody else to talk to? I doubt everything and everything so much, I even lost my religion as a result. How could some all seeing, all loving, all knowing God allow these miserable things to happen in the world?I even almost lose my job often because I'm so lazy and absent minded and I forget things or just don't want to do them or whatever else. He's picked up on it, and if he wasn't as lenient as he is I'd be long gone. At the rate I'm going, I'll amount to nothing but a basement dweller, and the worst part is I refuse to blame myself, even though I'm the obvious reason behind my problems.I just don't know what my problem is. I have a good life, good family, no money concerns, nothing to be depressed over. What is wrong with me...","1"
"First off, just wanna warn you this post is long af so bear with me. Any straight up advice would be appreciated.Just for a little background, I am 19(m) and have recently dropped out of university after only 2 months because I realised I made a rushed decision in picking it. Since then I have almost demonised the thought of going to university even if it were for another course. Of course this has left me with a year out which in many ways can be refreshing and useful in picking up on experiences for work and sociability. Yet at the moment I am constantly paralysed by thoughts that even getting out of bed is a challenge. I am awaiting checks for any conditions relating to anxiety and depression.I have been going through depersonalisation which is very scary to me. The feeling of waking up not knowing the world as it is, feeling like a spectator to your physical self. I have been able to find a hunger for success in my life but at the moment this is blotted out by the sense that nothing feels real and lacking connection to the outside world. My social anxiety has become very intense recently but Ive always had a desire to be sociable and open to others because Ive always wanted to have plenty of friends. I have been able to control it for months at a time but it doesnt help now that its become worse again. Distancing behaviour is also present which worries me because I have close friendships which are hard to take interest in when you feel empty as fuck. One of my best friends is at a local uni but I see him from time to time as he lives a minute away from me - even this feels isolating because Im too overwhelmed by my thoughts. Feels like Im sinking in wet sand while Im watching everyone walk on. Really kills me.Strangely I have lost all interest in activities which is quite offputting when it comes into mind, but that doesnt stop me from doing them. I have started to gym 2-3 times a week and do badminton every Monday night - even then I feel like Im sleepwalking through everything and nothing is actually happening. Playing pool calms me down too, Id love to take on a sport competitively to keep me occupied.Admittedly I spend too much time on technology. For years I have spent my free time alternating between education and just gaming and mindlessly scrolling through the internet - something which I feel is a stigma for why I feel so empty especially at this point in life. I have not had any family issues in life (unless sibling rivalry at a young age counts).I have never experiences relationships, although I have been involved in situations with girls a few times. At the moment I would still be able to show interest in girls but never really feel a sort of connection beyond that as with anyone really. I feel like my mental problems have blocked off the idea of pleasure including relationships as Im too overwhelmed with my thoughts of finding a purpose.Socially I have been quite disconnected and very weirdly it feels like its ireelevant to me. This I would put down to depression because there have been plenty of times where Ive felt an urge to socialise and I had no problem meeting new people at college. I go out clubbing from time to time but i always end up zoning out into my own world of pain, I can never connect myself to the present. Despite this people say Im mature and can speak very fluently despite not feeling like this is the case. Also, simple concepts such as friendship feel non existent to me - one of the consequences of the forgetfulness I live through. Best way to describe my anxiety is its almost like Ive been reborn in every way and have no idea how to live. And that really scares me.As of now, the best way to describe myself is I feel alienated and lost. The world appears a completely foreign place to me and I fear a lot about the future (Ive come to an assumption this is one of the other reasons for me feeling depressed). I have low self-esteem and have been beating myself down about everything recently. I find it hard to process information which is tiring, but against all odds I did manage to pass my driving test in August first time. A lot of days I feel very lonely yet I cant help but isolate. As hard as it is to see the way forward amongst the fogginess that is my brain atm I have always maintained a strong interest in creative media and would like to start seeing sense in life in the present so I can live with clarity and happiness again rather than dreading on autopilot mode. I am living at home with my parents and my sister, depression makes me overlook the appreciation I should feel having a roof above my head - yet i still beat myself up because I feel like I should be experiencing life like a uni student should be at this age. Maybe its just a matter of loneliness rather than having to party every weekend at 19, its such a small thing when you think about it yet I feel suicidal when I realise Im spending more time dwelling on the lives of others my age than trying to sort mine out... pls tell me thats absolute irrational.Recently I have been lapsing in and out of intense anxiety and this relates to worries of not being able to create a good future and ending up underachieving. Basically one thought resulting in another thought - times this by 500 or 600. I want to seek help but everything has become so distorted that I sometimes question whether my life is worth living - does this mean decluttering before pursuing my career?I feel bad about myself and the fact that I dont have a thicker skin but when youre in such a state its so difficult to think logically even if starting off. I never want to disappoint my parents but hope is so thin when you go each day with a constant internal pain that not even close ones can understand. I just feel like a living zombie and my thoughts always tell me Ill never be able to climb out of the hole. (in short, depersonalisation, anxiety, possibly depression, hopelessness, lack of motivation is drowning out my desire to go and achieve and Im not sure how to cope). As of now I go one day feeling ok and actually find motivation to do small tasks, the next I could feel suicidal and end up sitting in all day isolating myself - I really hate this and doesnt define me at all. What makes me think Im going insane is when someone speaks to me - my disassociative state becomes emphasised and once again this creates a new spiral of thoughts. My friend told me Im just overthinking which makes sense in some ways but I still feel suicidal some days.I hope to go travelling around Europe and apply for an apprenticeship next year (maybe with the BBC), I would love to start a YouTube channel as this involves techniques I learnt at college, also I would love to continue on with media whether its television production or editing. But for now my goal is to rediscover my well-being and see life in a positive perspective so I can wake up one day actually knowing who I am physically, spiritually, and identity wise.  Im here on this earth in my own body. Small steps, but each one to better myself in some way. I want to break away from the spiral of living in fear and worry over every small action I make. At the moment I am in fear of the world and myself for reasons which I can not pinpoint but I want to reach a stage where I can lift myself out of the hole and keep rising. Sorry for the long ass post, Id be surprised if youve made it this far ;) Even as Im typing this now my mental state cant even acknowledge what reddit is. So bad I know. Like Im trapped in a hench-ass bubble around my mind. If you have any advice or questions please let it outIf you need anyone to speak to about interests or whatever your mind can think of, dont be afraid to drop me a message... stay positive :)(In short: Im going through anxiety and depression which has got me in a state of irrational overthinking and feeling constant fear. I still feel a drive to succeed in life but also being dragged into a spiral of depression no matter how hard I try. DP/DR making me feel super paranoid about everything. Always have a desire to get back on track but am in a state of total confusion and worry...)","1"
"This is essentially where I'm stuck. I know I'm not good. I'm ashamed, deeply, of almost everything I've done or said over the last 15 years. I regret most of my decisions. I'm worthless, and the fact that I'm completely alone confirms it. I'm better by myself where I can't fuck anything up or hurt people.How do I recover from soul crushing sadness knowing that this misery is what I truly deserve in life, and that every decision I've ever made has led me here?","1"
"I've been depressed for years now, with ups and downs. But recently it has been getting worse. I easily lose my temper and I just don't feel like doing anything. Most of my days I spend crying or feeling down. And i just want to be all by myself. I just lost all hope and I'd honestly just can't take it anymore. I don't want to end my life but it scares me that I feel I just might one of these days. I wished I could just wake up one day and not feel anything or just feel happy.....","1"
"This may a really long ramble. I apologize.I know I'll get comments saying ""I care! Talk to me!"" But that's not what I mean. My whole family knows about my depression. I've told my mom and one of my sisters that I think about killing myself all the time. None of them ever mention it. I never get a ""hey, are you ok? want to talk?"" from either of them. They simply don't give a shit. My mom used to, but she rarely talks to me anymore. I'm 28 with three younger siblings, and I guess she stays too busy with them to worry about what the fuck I'm going through. We set up a time to go to lunch together once a week, which lasted a few months, but now she cancels more often than not (right now we're at 3 weeks in a row) because she's got other stuff to do. My dad has never asked me how I'm doing. The only time we've ever talked about it was years ago when I posted a facebook status about being depressed. In that post, I used profanity. He replied to me telling me that using that kind of language offends my younger siblings. That's the only thing he's ever said to me about it.I make it a point not to bother my family with my problems, to the point sometimes of not even coming around for weeks at a time.I don't have any friends. My best (and really only) friend through high school and college got married and moved an hour away, and now we rarely speak. I've tried, but people just don't seem to take an interest in me. I lent one of my ""friends"" in college $500 to pay his bills. He was grateful and paid it back, but that was it. Rarely spoke to me before or since then. Basically just used me as a loan officer.I'm now to the point where the selfishness and underhandedness of people has made me hate the whole human race.I've never been on a date. Every girl/woman that I've asked has given the ""I've got something else to do this weekend"" excuse. That happened all through high school and college to the point where I just gave up. I haven't even tried to get anyone in 6-7 years. By the way, none of them give a shit either.I hate my job. I'm a software developer and I feel like I'm drowning every single day. I read an article every day about the next new technology/programming language/framework/etc. and it just mentally drains me. People around me have a passion for it, and I'm just trying to get through my work without crying. I feel like a total failure at my job, and even if I didn't, I don't have the passion or the desire to learn anything new or to excel at it. The problem is there isn't anything else that I want to do. I have no hobbies, passions, nothing. When I leave work, I go home and watch TV. On weekends, I sit on the couch and watch TV. That is literally my life. Guess what? No one gives a fuck about that either. I've had therapists (and my mom) ask me ""What do you want to do?"" and ""Start looking for another job"". I want to shout at them ""WHAT JOB? I DON'T WANT ANYTHING ELSE BUT FOR MY LIFE TO END!"" None of them get it. It's almost like it's a given for them that I should, by default, have an interest or desire in something and that's what I should pursue. They either don't understand or don't care enough to give me a useful answer.I don't know what else to say. I'm pretty sure my life is going to end soon. Like, within the next 6 months. There is no escape from this. This life is a grinder, and the only way to avoid being pummeled into dust is to hop off early.","1"

"Im in a bad situation. Im a freshman in college, and after a recent break-up with my boyfriend, I have realized that I had no other friends. He ended it with me, and Im still very upset. What do I do? Are there any people on here whove been friendless before and can explain how they got out of it? I want advice to keep in mind before I start the spring semester.Background: Ive always had borderline antisocial tendencies. I was a loner in high school. I have a tendency to serially date in order to always have an emotional support system due to my lack of friends.I am very mistrustful of other people and tend to assume the worst (theyre only talking to me because of X, That thing they said must have been passive aggressive, theyre only interacting with me to take pity on me, etc).I have very low motivation and have trouble taking initiative.My friendlessness is something Ive taken for granted, because in high school, the longer schoolday occupied my time, so I was usually too exhausted by the time I got home to have wanted or been able to do much anyway, and because I was much closer to my siblings back then. But now that Im in college, its really starting to hit me. I need somebody to hold me when Im shaking, or to talk to me when Im crying, but I have done nothing to deserve it, and am all too aware of it. My dorm is a complete mess, and Ive started to forget to eat/only eat things that are easy to eat. I found myself intentionally bruising up my arms against the frame of my bed. I feel like my life is going downhill and spinning out of control, and I dont know who to talk to or what to do. I feel like a pitiful little creature. ","1"
"The kiddie version of me looked forward to growing up and living as a free adult. The adult version of me looks back missing the freedom and child like wonder about the world.

I wake up every day with a nauseated pull in my stomach wanting to go back to sleep. At night I dread going to bed because I know I will be laying awake long enough to let my mind dive into dark places I cannot escape.I spend 100% of the time with myself, but I dont know who I am. I know I am cynical, I have a lot of anger and hate. Maybe it is there to cover the pain that slowly consumes my soul and will lead me to the end of the rope.This surely cannot be how life is supposed to be? I cant take this anymore.","1"
"I used to be very sociable and most importantly funny too. Now I feel like I don't make alot of jokes and 9/10 times they're about suicide. Thing is I've been depressed for quite some time now, and for like 5 months I lived with a friend and his family (16m), and I got back to my old self and making jokes in school again. I used to be one of the more populair guys and now I am quite forgetable. Whenever I am at parties I just sit there uncomfortably don't really go out talking or make jokes because I've just lost it unless I am really in my zone/am comfortable. ","1"
"I'm not popular but I'm quite empathetic. I can understand other's situation/feeling well, I could manage to make some friends with this....skill??? Though they didn't like me, they just wanted to vent something.My other family members are cold, cruel, unempathetic. I don't understand, isn't this usually genetic?Anyway, both my parents were raised in abusive household, they are full of anger, coldness with cruel hearts. My older brother is kinda psychopathic.I'm the youngest, but I always should be the one who endure everything and console others. I had to cheer up my parents while they didn't have ability to do that. Aren't parents supposed to do that for their child? Not the other way round?Friends or general people too.I realized people are generally suck at imagining themselves in other people's shoes, oh that's why I could make some friends. Because no one listens to them like I do. Even my therapist liked chatting with me, saying that I understood what she was talking about very well, session with me was not difficult. (English is not my tongue, in case you think my writing sucks)But when I opened up about myself to others, told my problems, friends and colleagues all ran away.All of them ran away. Not one left since then.Recently one of them invited me to her wedding, I didn't go there.I'm now broke, don't have money to buy not the cheapest gift, didn't wanna meet school reunions there, and, .........I don't think we were actually friends.I'm emotionally unavailable, depressed, have my own problems, how come I always end up being the one who should understand others and comfort/cheer up them?Why is life so unfair? If I were a psychopath, life wouldn't have been this miserable.","1"
"Like me, most of my fellow interns have recently graduated from university this year. That also means we're all on the hunt for full time positions. Some early on landed jobs, and gradually over time many more did too. Besides the interns who are still in school and the couple decided to remain interns into the next year, I'm the only left with no insight on what I'm going to do.Now don't get me wrong. All of my fellow interns are beyond deserving of the positions they landed. I'm truly happy for them.Thing is, though, I'm even amazed I landed this internship in the first place. I already suffer from major depression, and have had (and still do) little to no confidence in myself and abilities. I have no motivations, little energy to do anything, and have little redeeming qualities.All of that is amplified when you see your co-interns leave for full time positions. I feel like shit because my life and anything about me is garbage. No one seems to think I'm worthy of hiring and I've sensed for a long time that my current bosses even wonder why they selected me for this internship.I just don't know anymore. I give up.

"Just as the title states, I was wondering if anyone else had this happen to them, I know it's probably the case, but I'd still like to ask.&nbsp; I'm normally very good at hiding my emotions, especially when I am feeling down; But sometimes it becomes too much to hide.&nbsp;Today was one of those days; Even self-talk proved to be completely ineffectual.&nbsp;I think it's the hardest for me, because not only did it happen at work, but it was obvious to everyone. (i.e., ""You don't seem like yourself today. You normally have a bit of pep in your step! You're usually chirpy, and very energetic/spunky). &nbsp;Even my boss had something to say, she stopped me right before I left the building, asked me to smile, said it was ""Ok"", and that she ""Didn't know what was wrong"", but ""Wanted me to be happy"". It hurt so much to stay quiet, that I felt tears starting to form in my eyes. (I'm only part-time there, I have episodes like this, but only once in a while, so what's the point of telling them). &nbsp;But there is one thing these episodes make me think: ""Is this really me? Or is the person they talk about me?"" It really does make me wonder, possibly even doubt myself. Is the medicated, self-talking, peppy-happy person me? Or am I depressed, quiet, empty person?&nbsp;I just want this identity crisis stuff to stop, between my BPD and depressive episodes (that usually last for SIX OR MORE HOURS), it's tearing me apart; I allowed suicidal thoughts to cross my mind a few times this episode too. Primarily because I just wondered what it'd be like to not have to deal with this anymore. But I always remind myself about all the stuff I'll miss out on, if I were to do that; Not the pain I'd cause others though, no, I guess I'm too selfish to think that way yet.&nbsp;###~~WHO AM I?!

"Hello everyone i will try to keep it short. I have depression and i was prescribed with escitalopram and olanzpine BUT after a couple of weeks i noticed that i became much dumber ,to the fact that i had to abandon my masters degree.However i kept the medication for 1 year and then i cut it of abruptly  because to tell the truth i didnt like the doctor and i wanted to leave. I was off meds for 3-4 months and still the symptoms didn't go.And i switched to a doctor that i really like, he prescribed me fluoxetine and rhisperidone ,i took them for 1 month BUT after a while i noticed that i started to develop severe memory problems to the point where i can't remember what i studied yesterday,even though i studied hard.Anyhow i had to stop the fluoxetine because i am allergic to it.And i have a new prescription on the way.My question is,does anyone know what is happening??I want to start a new masters program and i think i am doomed to fail.

"Hi everybody, Ive a question for those who may have experience with various anti-depressants and/or supplements, which is probably 99% of readers here. In the next paragraph Ill briefly describe what I take and how meds make me feel for background info. If you want to skip straight to the question, go to the third paragraph. Ive been taking Bupropion xl 300mg, and Viibryd 20mg. Never had issues with Bupropion except that the very pronounced positive effects it has stopped after about a week after beginning to game it. In my case I had take it in the past but for less than a year. This happened each time after start of the prescription.  Viibryd doesnt have stimulating effects I could feel but it definitely does not have the sedating effects of SSRIs. I am talking about how when they begin working they do take away intense worrying and depression but also , at least in my case, they reduce motivation to do random things that may be called fun optional activities like going outside or playing video games. That in addition to increased sweating is why I choose to not take standard SSRIs and instead asked something without demotivating effects. Viibryd really does seem to not have any side effects, but its intended effect is weak so far as well. The question is about a problem Ive felt for a week now. I didnt stop or reduce meds I am taking, but my mind feels as if the motivation to do things I cognitively understand I should be interested in is very weak or gone, and it causes me to have a sensation that some areas of my brain may be working at less than 50% capacity. I cannot say I feel dumb as I am able to do all the Norma mental tasks, but the ability to focus on them and actively think and analyze goes away when random or tangential thoughts take over. I can even get some more concrete idea that the mind is not at full speed when I play some competitive board games either against the computer or against people online. I can see evaluations of each move and game outcomes. Theyre displayed on a graph where I can see 2-3 years back of daily play, for example. Any idea what could be causing it, or how to shake it off? (I tried drinking more than usual amounts of coffee, and various brain supplements such as b-12, choline, green tea extract, b-3, b-6)","1"
"I was watching a comedy show, just laughing like I didn't went through a depression at all. I stopped taking my meds few weeks ago because I already felt better. As I went to grab a can of beer in the fridge, I saw my bedroom door open so I entered. I sat on my bed for a moment and everything suddenly becomes so silent. So empty. Thinking ""I'm laughing alone... again"" It felt like I'm cheating myself. Loneliness suddenly cuts through my bones, adding the fact that I'm living alone in this apartment. I broke down. I cried so hard that I could barely breath. That's when I called my parents because I don't want to do it and disappoint them again.","1"

"Look at me, capitalising on my misery on reddit.Went into work feeling really down, and it sucked when I had to interact with my colleagues and customers (I work in a cafe and there's no room for introversion or avoiding social interaction). My manager commented that my performance has slipped lately and that my mood has been low, and when they asked me what was wrong, I started crying as I tried to explain (not often you see a grown man cry). I mentioned that I was feeling depressed and that it's starting to make the job and life harder, but I think they interpreted it as meaning that I'm finding the job stressful. However, they gave me an employee helpline to ring, and they mentioned that they'd talk to someone higher up in the company.It's not that the job is too stressful for me--it's that my low mood is making the job stressful. I don't want to talk to people, but I have to. It's so draining being positive and chirpy when all you feel is self-hatred and depression.I'm at the absolute lowest point I've ever been right now. Even the gym is hard to go to now. ","1"

"Not sure why I'm even writing this cause I'll likely delete it. Constantly feeling hit with shit. Just feels like non-sense and is denigrating. All day long I actually thought about shooting myself in the heart. I feel like my discussions with certain individuals in charge of me are falling on deaf ears. Being in the military and in college is at times stressful to say the least. I talked to my first line leader who just happens to be the LTC and he basically told me to be less stressed about grades cause ""C's get degrees"". I have asked for the ability to not go to our annual formal event. The reason I don't want to go is because we have ""skits"" but I have seen the ideas for some of the skits and guess what favorite punching bag is the center of one set of skits? You got that right me! I am called ""the biggest fuck"" in my battalion. People like to use me as a punching bag, but then come to me when they need knowledge on something they are void in. Waking up at 5 am to have a 17hr+ day and then have individuals make jokes about me is just taking its toll. Don't know how much longer I can do this. ","1"
"Dude the amount of depression I feel right now is ridiculous. How can I cheer up? :( I have work pretty soon too, been tossing and turning in my sleep with anxiety because of that as well. Ugh, i hate having depression and anxiety. ","1"
"I'm 19 and last year I had to drop out of college due to problems with my depression and anxiety, I then moved back in with my mom for a couple months, as my mental health seemed to get worse and worse my mom would kind of threaten me with sending me to a hospital for my anxiety and depression. It was then the last thing I wanted to do. Things kept getting worse however, I started to have panic attacks daily where I would shake uncontrollably and barely be able to breath, anyone else experience that? It's so strange to me that I can like have a seizure over just about anything, my mom would basically yell at me to stop and say stuff like ""you're ok, don't be anxious"" or ""it's ok anxiety isn't a part of you, you can break it"" and stuff along those lines. I started to get these really severe testicular pains that resulted in 4 ER visits. I thought I was dying or something, but all the tests for everything came back negative. Looking for answers I went to my regular doctor who had known me all my life and within minutes she told me the pain was most likely from my anxiety and that I needed to go seek treatment ASAP. I started balling, my mom and gf took me straight to a treatment center and idk how but I felt better after just signing up for a IOP program, it was like admitting I had a anxiety and depression disorder helped me deal with it in a way, my pain stopped. While on the waiting list for the program I moved in with my gf and away from my mom, which I now realize is one of the best decisions I've ever made, I never knew how much my mom was stressing me out on a daily basis till I moved out, I know her intentions were good but the way she went about trying to help only made me feel worse. My gf is so much more supportive and helpful when it comes to my depression than I ever thought anyone could be. After I finally got to go to the IOP program thing I learned so much about what I was going through my whole life and when I was done I finally felt some relief that I had been waiting for. I felt like I was on top of the world, I felt cured in a way, I would occasionally feel depressed or anxious but the coping mechanisms I learned in my group therapy made it all manageable, I applied for college again for something different than I was originally going for, and to a different college that was closer to my new home. I started seeing a therapist and psychologist. I realized what my mom would say to me was the last thing you should say to someone suffering from mental health episodes, I owned my anxiety and depression and made them my bitch. I felt great but then of course everything soon would go to complete shit.I got in a huge fight with my mom and out of the blue my depression and anxiety came back in full storm, I was getting yelled at by mom over the phone and I just started shaking like crazy, my face was twitching, which never happened before when I would get panic attacks and threw up and I think I said something like ""I can't talk right now I have to go"" and hung up, which lead to my mom calling me upwards of 20 times and texting me an unbelievable amount of messages mainly about how disrespectful and ungrateful I was, my gf came home to my just twitching and balling my eyes out on the floor. She managed to calm me down after about an hour and I explained to her what happened and I would get into what the fight was about because I think this post is gonna be long enough but after explaining it to my gf she agreed that my mom was being completely ridiculous over what she was first upset about. But after that I feel like my mental health was 100x worse than it was before the IOP program, my panic attacks came back worse and more frequently than ever before, I still can't even get out of bed until 4 or 5pm, and the fight was 4 months ago, since then I decided I wanted to see a new therapist but haven't gotten myself to call to schedule a new appointment with someone else after canceling with who I saw before, I've been switched on meds so many times I don't remember and all the meds do is seem to make things worse, and I'm going to full on postal if I hear that same damn speech about how it takes time to work and the pills are basically guess and check until they find one that works. I'm frustrated with how little I do all day, I don't have a job and I couldn't get myself to actually go to school for the registration so I guess I dropped out once again. The thought of school just makes me anxious as hell, I've got a friend going into the trades and I've decided that that's what I do with my life but I haven't been able to take any actual steps towards doing it, I do nothing all day but wallow in my own sadness and cry, I constantly have panic attacks that cause me to go lie down for hours my gf complains that she's bored all the time and that she wants to do stuff but I'm so scared to leave the house, I do for her but it's so hard for me, she doesn't seem to understand I gave up trying to explain it. I try the coping strategies that helped me so much before but nothing worked, nothing helps anymore. I feel so foolish, I feel so helpless, I feel so lost in life. I've been lurking on here for a while reading other people's stories I thought I might share my own I guess. I'd be curious to know if anyone else is going through anything similar, things just keep getting worse and worse. Big thanks to whoever reads this, if anyone actually does, I don't know but it means a lot to me, just typing all that out feels good, I appreciate whoever takes the time to read it. ","1"
"So, I'm 23, and I'm very sure that I am bisexual. It's just that, after being very mentally ill for twelve years, I think my parents are tired of my shit. I understand that they've put up with really dumb decisions I have made, my compulsive behaviors, and many suicide attempts. Now they are taking time off of work to drive me to ECT treatments, which I know is hard on them. And, I mean, I'm already embarrassed by my mental illnesses, so I don't know how I'd feel if my parents paraded around the fact that their daughter is attracted to men AND women. I guess it also doesn't help that I've gained A LOT of weight these past few months, and I feel completely undesirable.

Yesterday I literally took a walk around my work site during break and all I did was contemplate all the different ways to do it, jumping off the top of our dome, or jumping in a screw conveyor, or just jumping in the river.

I just need advice on how to move on, or stop thinking about her. All I want to do is talk to her, and she's nice enough to understand the situation and talks to me, and has kept it between us...but I'm selfish and want more and I can't deal with it.

"Hey everyone!Gender: female (me), male (him). Both 24, been together for a year. I recently found out about a month ago that my boyfriend of one year had cheated on me. I'll keep the story short but we always struggled about his flirtatious behavior towards other women and how it bothered me. He always promised it would never go too far. In the end of July, he called me upset from another country (we work for an airline) saying that he met a girl at the bar and was walking her home trying to be a gentleman and that she kissed him at the door. He says he was so shocked he didn't know how to respond and he froze but that he feels horrible and he's never going to communicate with her again. After he came home, things became very complicated. I learned that I was pregnant, and had an abortion. Right after the abortion, he wasn't very supportive and said he wanted to take a break, but not see other people. I told him if that's what he needed to go do it, but no seeing other people. I found out later on that he met up with that girl again, went to her house, she made him dinner, and they kissed and laid together in her bed. She told me that he made it very clear to her that he didn't have a girlfriend and couldn't because of his job. I also found out from another girl he was talking to that he approached her at a bar, told her she was so beautiful he had to speak to her, exchanged info, and invited her to visit him in NYC. He also had photos of these women and a few others I do not know saved on his phone. My heart is broken. The next day, he came begging for a second chance and promised to change everything. He has since reset his phone and cut off contact with them. I know he is trying and I am trying to forgive as well I am just struggling so hard. I still feel so hurt and betrayed. I keep lashing out in anger at him, I get aggressive and I fight and scream, which is not my character at all. I want so badly to forgive and start fresh because I love him so much despite everything. Is it possible? Or is it too soon? Any advice would be great. Thank you. ","1"
"I just get angry. I always lash out at family when I have bad days. Then I feel like shit for getting angry. I never told anyone I depressed but my mom thinks I'm bi polar and it pissed me off.

"First I just want you to know that this is probably gonna be, as stated in the title, a quite messy wall of text... There are just a lot of things I wanna vent and some of them don't quite connect with each other, but I'll do my best.Hello. I'm a 24 years old Brazilian male. Currently unemployed and recently found out that I have Misophonia, a mental condition that renders me completely unable to listen to dogs barking without having an instant, involuntary anger attack. Personality wise I think of myself as someone wise and mature, and Im not afraid to admit that because honestly, I worked hard to acquire this knowledge. I'm also quite nice and try to help people out as much as I can. I always try to smile to people when I'm out, because I've learned that a smile can sometimes brighten someone's day a little (or a lot!), and you can even end up getting another friend in the end. However... Recently I realized that growing up to be so nice and wise wasnt as good as I expected itEven at my teen ages, when I was still quite nave, I already had an understanding of what I wanted from people and what I wouldnt tolerate from them. So Becoming wiser than people at my age came out pretty naturally to me. But sometimes I just wish it never did... For one I became able to read people like books. All I need is a quick glance at someone or a brief chat to tell if were gonna be good friends, casual friends or if I rather not bond with them. Sure, you shouldnt judge people by their appearances, and I always try not to. But once you keep seeing always the same patterns The look on their faces, the way they talk, the way they dress, what they like It just becomes really easy to connect the dots and tell that someone wont click with you. And that lead me to become rather lonely myself I do talk to my family every day, and I am in fact nice to anyone who isnt an asshole to me, but I just developed way too many standards over time and those make me unable to find myself comfortable bonding with people that just dwell in their own mediocrity and refuse to change. People who dont appreciate the beauty of small things, who are unable to recognize and value small acts that truly make a friendship shine So in the end its pretty much my own fault for being lonely, and thats fine for most of the time really. Ive done a quite good job at dealing with it over the time. But sometimes it just gets dark, and no one is here for me when Im always there for themThe thing about getting stronger and stronger is that Eventually you become so strong that you dont have anyone equally or stronger than you to comfort you. And that REALLY sucks. You become able of carrying so many people on your shoulders, but you never have anyone to carry you when you need it, even if just for a little bit Getting comfort from people that dont quite understand your position just gets predictable and ineffective with time. Sometimes you just need someone that really gets you and knows the right words to ease your heart, but Im slowly accepting the fact that Ill just be alone forever. Even though I have the lowest of expectations when meeting new people, they always fail me. I try my best to accept peoples defects and value their virtues, but they dont do the same for me Theyre unable to sit down and talk things over when Im the one who messes up. So they just drop everything and leave me.To be fair I think my biggest nemesis right now is my misophonia These angry spasms dont happen a lot through the day, but they do happen every day in fact And when they happen it feels like a spike stabbing my mind and giving me this stupid involuntary reaction. I dont usually blow up in front of people, but I get really uncomfortable and have to retreat to my sanctuary. If I could get a job things would be so much easier Im pretty sure it would even help my misophonia out. But were currently going through an economic crisis and getting a job has been nearly impossible for me, since the companies have to pay your transport to work but theyve been refusing to do so, and employing only people that live close to them. And unfortunately I live far from the region which usually employs, so theres thatI just really miss being able to lie down on my bed and shut down. And wake up the next day and run to work. A lot of the times before trying to sleep my mind just wanders to dark places, and makes it hard to fall asleep On top of that, some days Im abruptly awakened by the neighbors dog, which is just Hellish. Its so bad. I really want my life to get back on track I miss having money to buy stuff. Going out and buying me a yummy treat. Having the energy to focus on something productiveIm sure this will eventually end. It will become just another experience and Ill get even stronger (oh no). But right now This burden is just really weighing me down. I just wanna have peace again and work on my dreams, but all these situations render me unable to do anything but wait And the uncertainty of it is really maddening I know that there are people in situations much, MUCH darker than mine. And while thats somewhat comforting, that doesnt change the fact that this is really wearing me down And having no one to lean over just feels sad and hopeless. But I dont wanna give up. I feel I have a genuinely good heart and I wanna help people find that goodness within them as well. And I dont wanna just throw away all the progress Ive made until here.Thank you SO much if youve read his far. I really needed to get this out of my chest, and I just hope to read some uplifting words. And be reminded Im not alone in this. Have a nice day and I hope your situation gets better someday!","1"
"First of all, I apologise for posting this in here if it's not appropriate - just let me know if that's the case - but I really couldn't think of anywhere else to post it & I suffer from depression so - here goes...I'm going to see a panto tomorrow with my Mum, and I have reason to believe that my estranged step-daughter is involved in it, and I'm terrified of her. She hates my very guts and has been nothing but abusive towards me. She basically turned my lovely, late husband (her father) into a victim of domestic abuse by beating him up twice - the first time he was left with a permanent scar on his cheek, the second she knocked one of his teeth out. She has been diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder. I haven't seen her for 4 years since she turned on me for refusing to give her any money (well, I tried to send her a couple of cheques but it wasn't good enough so she sent them back in a rage & said she never wanted to see me again.)Actually, she never visited me after my husband's death - she arranged at least half a dozen visits but cancelled each one by text message at the last minute... She sent her brother round to ask for money - he was in my house for 3 hours & wouldn't leave. He said it was lucky I was dealing with him & not his sister or it would have been the worse for me. Eventually I got him to go, but I was very shaken.I have Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, CFS and an ileostomy - I couldn't fight her if she went for me - I know she is capable of that. I have also been diagnosed with PTSD since my husband's sudden death & I know her behaviour has been part of that. I even dream about her on a regular basis. I've really only just started to leave the house again properly in 4 years. But I also feel guilty - maybe I should have given her more money. She was my husband's daughter after all and he did love her dearly, I know that. Maybe I should have tried to help her. I was a pretty useless step-mother, I'm sure (she does have a real Mum, who she has also beaten up on a fairly regular basis - she may not be doing that these days - at least, I hope not!) I'm sure none of this is what my husband would have wanted. I should add that she & her brother are both beneficiaries in my Will - it seems only fair - but I haven't told them.I was unable to have children of my own after suffering Primary Ovarian Failure at the age of 17 and failed to go through puberty properly. Tests were run but they couldn't even find my ovaries - it's possible that I never had them in the first place but we don't know. I really feel like I've been left with nothing at times - I know I should count my blessings though.Apologies if this is confused! There is a lot more detail I could go into but I'd better not. I'm just hoping she doesn't spot me at this panto tomorrow because I'm terrified something awful will happen if she does. Hopefully she'll just ignore me. God, I feel so pathetic and useless, and so, so lonely - I've tried hard to get out & about again & I'm sick of feeling so scared all the time. On a more general level, I feel like I must be a really bad person.Thanks for reading!","1"

"First of all, I know it's not safe at all to auto-diagnose on this kind of issues, but that's why I'm here searching for advice.Anyway, during this year I've been showing an increasing lack of motivation and happiness. It started around the April I think.I've always been really motivated and generally happy person with a lot of projects and hobbies (music, programming, videogames, 3D modelling, etc) that I really loved. But this year has been... different. Starting a lot of projects left unfinished, feeling tired and empty a lot of the time, dropped out of the sport I was practicing because I just couldn't go out there and put energy into something, although always suffering from introversion, it was totally worse than before. I never considered suicide a solution to anything though, I strongly believe that I could never do that or even harm myself for dealing with this.Finishing the secondary school two weeks ago didn't help because I already lost almost all connection to my school friends (almost all my friends are school friends, except a few). And a week from now it's my graduation night (kinda like prom but not quite) and I'm already feeling really anxious and the feeling of not wanting to go is growing stronger and stronger, but I'm going anyway because I already payed lots for the invitations and clothes.Also, distance is growing between me and my crush, to which I was really close before, and it just makes me sad.Nowadays, my routine is basically wake up at 1 PM, eating, playing videogames, do some chores, if I'm feeling inspired I might play piano for a while but not too much, and go to sleep.I feel like I don't have anyone to talk to, even though I know I have my family and friends who would be happy to help, but I just can't get enough courage to talk to anyone. I also considered searching professional help, but knowing myself I either wouldn't be able to ask my dads to help me search or I would end up not going because of anxiety.I also am going to start university next year and I feel I don't have the emotional state to start studying and putting myself out there in the world.

I waited almost two weeks before I got a message from her and she hardly made an effort to keep the conversation going.

"I mean...I do want to die. I'm still depressed and I still have a really hard time putting my life and perspective in any sort of agreeable order. But when I was lying in bed straight sufffeerinngggg from an allergic reaction to a cold medication I knew that If I died in this painful, sweaty, delirious way I would be extremely regretful. Like in the void of space or whatever my particles would be pissed. I've always wanted to die! I literally dreamed of having this sort of experience that would just kill me and leave no trace that I ever wanted it. Guilt-free death. However, two hours after downing some DMX/codeine stuff I started having what I can only experience as a terrible terrible shroom trip. My head was pounding and my body was so unbearably heavy. I couldn't keep my thoughts in order and barely made my mouth move enough to warn my boyfriend that I was probably going to die in my sleep and it was nice knowing him. I know codeine makes you trippy but I had like a capful of this stuff. I was laying next to my then boyfriend, having a terrible time as my heart rate went up to an audible beat and the bed was absolutely soaking with my sweat and according to my ex, all the color in my body just left. I was like..fuck dude if this is how i'm gonna die i might as well just live long enough to off myself the way I want! It was a really surprising thought and I even remember thinking things like 'there's so much I haven't done' and 'I want to talk to my mom one last time.' Eventually, I got up and made myself throw up for like 3 hours and felt normal enough to sleep. When I woke up, I didn't necessarily see things in the same light but i've noticed I haven't been as suicidal lately when i'm usually contemplating my demise on the daily.

The child psychologist I saw tacked it up to my home life being rough, abusive father, parents going through a divorce, as well as a few other things.I've dealt with it all my life since, sometimes in short bursts that seemingly happen out of nowhere, other times it's like this constant nagging that just won't stop no matter what's going on around me. I usually keep it in check fairly well, but now he things going on around me are making it so hard to do that, there's so many things I've done wrong and mistakes I've made that it's probably done irreparable damage to my marriage and my kids don't even look at me the same.This last month has been particularly hard. My family and I are about to lose our place to live because our previous property manager has issued a non-renewal letter to the new management company before leaving her position for a promotion with this new company. We're currently on a month to month lease and they just bumped my rent up by nearly $500 dollars compared to what we're used to paying. All the while this is going on, my wife is working full time, and I'm working two days a week because we can't afford a baby sitter for our children so while I'm alone most of the time with my kids, I can't seem to enjoy the time I spend with them at all. She makes more money than I do, so it makes sense for her to work full time and me part time. It was a crappy situation that made me regret a lot of choices we made but it was livable because we were able to keep a roof over our heads, and now we're probably going to be out on the street in less than two weeks.I have the money for the rent now, but I'm stuck in my head trying to decide if I should pay it, or try and find another place to live. If I do pay it then we won't have enough to cover our utilities and our lights will be cut off. That'll give the leasing office grounds for eviction as in our complex you cannot occupy an apartment without electricity. However we have shitty credit and finding a place affordable enough that's big enough for a family our size is nearly impossible. I feel like I'm trapped in my head while all this is going on around me, almost like I'm watching someone else's life fall apart right in front of me and there's nothing I can do about it. I feel sad, yeah, but more than anything I just feel defeated. My friends all abandoned me when we had our first child so I literally have nobody to talk to about anything I'm feeling except her. But that puts such a strain on our already fragile relationship. I just don't know what to do anymore. I'm scared and confused and nothing makes any sense right now.TL;DR: My depression is kicking my ass right now in the midst of my apartment complex trying to get us out. ","1"

"I use to not think about my childhood. Maybe because the present was just as enjoyable as the past at that point in my life. Now I spend my days actively reminiscing about small moments in my childhood. Maybe walking to the park with my mother. Learning how to ride a bike. Playing with friends. Our family vacations. I feel like the negativity I allowed to swallow me whole dampened those memories for awhile but now theyre back and in full color and I cant help but feel my depression triggered by the fact I cannot simply rewind time and feel Ive wasted so much of it making the wrong decisions. I want to take my parents to the beach we went to as a child so Ive been trying to save money for a hotel. I just want to feel careless with them one more time. My father is old and not in the best shape. Who knows when I wont have that opportunity anymore. Is that selfish? Anyway...Im rambling. I dont like the person I see in my reflection so I close my eyes and see that girl before the world tore her apart ","1"
"So the whole story started 2 years ago. I just got into a new class in a new school. Then there was a girl, I had a crush on her and I was pretty sure she felt the same way. At that time I already often was feeling down, so I texted her about it (probably wasnt a smart idea). So yeah, she went to the teacher and after two worthless sessions with a completly inept teacher and a cold principal they called my parents. Now my parents were very nice and their only statement was, that I should stop cutting myself because the scars wouldnt look nice. So life continued and so did my depression. Later i started texting another girl and found out that she also was depressed. So we had some good chats, but it was kind of useless. So I called for help a third time. Nothing. A fourth time. Nothing. One more time. And this last time fucked me over so hard. Basically the last time I texted somebody and she didnt take it that well. She started treating me like shit and was constantly harassing and insulting me infront of everybody.  But that wasnt enough. She had to tell all my classmates and with her version of the story everbody now thinks Im a psycho. This isnt the only problem but, here is the story that lead me to the brink.TL;DR the whole school thinks Im a psycho and an asshole. But if they want to believe that, fine, but Im gonna prove the opposite by either hanging myself in a classroom or shooting myself on the high school certificate party or whatever its called.And to specify: I take the blame for this situation, at least a big part of it. I shouldnt have texted them.","1"

"I couldnt see at the time that I was afraid of letting people in. I thought it would be better and stronger if I did this by myself, if I held back and didnt expose you to what was happening in my mind so I wouldnt be childish or immature. I was in a bad state, seeing things in a very distorted way, and avoiding people out of fear they would admonish my thoughts. I isolated which has hurt me so bad: the time feels wasted, I can never get it back.All Ive really wanted in life is to love and be loved. Other people see me differently than how I see myself. Because i felt I was not adequate, i overcompensated. It was embarrassing, confusing and painful.Over the last several weeks, Ive dropped the act a bit. Ive been able to look at people in the eye and smiles come naturally. I see people differently, as wanting to help rather than hurt. I see myself as imperfect but the same as others - lovingly imperfect. Allowing and accepting these qualities makes me more able to do so in others.I remember the talks we had, the moments of sharing our must vulnerable selves, and feeling the utmost relief from being heard, validated and love. It is the only way. I see know that I have more knowledge to make better choices about how to spread love. Only through love, and soft understanding, does the message get across. Only through love will their be another chance at forgiveness and a better life.I hope that my friend understand. I think they will. I hope  that I can continue to try to ward off those critical thoughts toward myself and my parents, and accept them in a way I could not before. That is perhaps my biggest fault and evil, blaming and criticizing them in my head for what felt like being wronged and ignored.I wish I could tell them all of this. They may not really know the extent of the problem, nor understand.Above all, I thank a therapist who listened to me vent and complain, and saw me only through loving eyes. I thank her for pointing out the good in me and for listening in a non judgmental way and for treating me with respect when I could not give it to myself. Our latest session was so healing, I cant explain why or how, but without it I wouldnt feel at this very moment.Thank you for helping me turn to the light side, to lift the veil of fear that has clouded my ability to see what is true and right, to see that there is a better way. Thank you for showing me that without rain, only a Desert can exist. Maybe this rain helps me become a person who has a forest of feeling to share with others in an imperfect hut lovable way. I find it hard to feel harsh toward others when I know many others can be as lost, hurt and confused.God, please grant me the ability to see the light when my mind wants to jump to the worst possible conclusions about myself. Please help me see that Im loved in spite of my faults, and that what I think and what is actually happening can be very different. I hope that I can return to the light over and over again, to the best of my ability, without becoming hurt and in pain as I have been.Thank you. Edit: I also wanted to add that I am grateful for choosing to quit marijuana two weeks ago. It was perhaps a major contributor to the depression, and I see that I wasnt being loyal or true to myself. It affects everyone differently, but it may help or hurt those who are sensitive or have a chemical imbalance. Anyone struggling with drug addiction, know that you have valid reasons to do so. I certainly did, but quitting has cleared my mind to remember that life has good moments, pure moments of love.","1"
"I've always wanted to end it but I can't, knowing my parents just spent a shit ton of money on rehab, and other treatments in the past. It makes me feel like I have no escape.  I feel like I'll have a burden throughout my life in knowing how much they tried to help me. ","1"

Here for about a month now, I've been in a dark place and felt super alone even though I'm constantly surrounded by people. I also feel I only have more loneliness to look forward to because I'm moving cross country at the end of next month.I took a PHQ-9 yesterday and scored 16. Whatever stress test I took said that I was ""Over Threshold."" Last night, I cut for the first time since I was 19 and didn't even feel bad about it. A couple of months ago, I purged for the first time in about a year and have been regularly bulimic since then. I just feel like I'm slowly spiraling downward and I don't know where to turn.

"I have never in my life been diagnosed with depression and have never had any symptoms until last night. Ever since last night (where I also made my first post here) I have been feeling this emptiness inside. Like the only times I have felt any emotion is when I have been happy, while talking to my gf to be (hopefully). Im only 13 and Im afraid to tell my parents! They think that I have some form of anger management issues, so they put me in therapy of sorts. Im thinking about telling them, since my mom is struggling with depression also they will probably understand. I dont know, I have just been feeling so empty inside the last 24 hours. I kinda ignore it at school, because then I wear my mask. Its kinda a way to make people like me, I portray myself as the ideal  person to them. And it works. Usually this is why the people who are the most difficult to read hate me the most. I kinda went of track, but I mostly write these for myself to get it out of my head. Thank you!","1"
"I have been through a lot. No family, my only ex abandoned me and so on. I have been through abuse and I struggle all alone. I was attending a short-term class and I was aiming to make friends and be happy. Ended up as an outcast and mostly because there was some drama between me and the guy I liked. The guy I liked was biased since he was my teacher's relative. Last day he ended up doing something I did not like and felt betrayed, so I ended up snapping after he left. I could not control it. So I had the teacher screaming in my face and defending the guy. Then he acted nice. Still I feel so damaged and I did not stop crying for 2 days. I was such a fool. I was chasing a guy who I thought liked me. There is an upcoming farewell party and I was planning to attend and now I am being told that it requires RSVP and it is too late cause the guy I liked collected email addresses to RSVP but did not mine. I feel so depressed, like an outcast. I put effort in this class to make friends and then I realize those people were just being nice, not caring.And then my teacher acts I am wrong and the class is so loving and I need a therapist because I view everyone as an enemy, etc. Describes me the guy I liked, his relative, as this perfect nice being. And then he contradicts himself saying I am a good person. I have been feeling so bad to the point of considering suicide. Please give me some support.","1"

"I had a major research paper due yesterday that was worth a third of my grade, and there was just no way I could finish it on time.  What I submitted wasn't a reflection of how much research I had done because I didn't have time to cite it all or arrange it into a logically flowing essay.  I couldn't have written anything coherent without first doing heaps of research because none of it was common sense.  I had an A in that course and I'm probably going to finish with a C.  I worked so hard all semester.  The time constraints for the larger assignments in that course were insane.  I spent so much miserable, sleep-deprived time on that course and this final blow is what it amounted to.I'm not privileged enough to not have a job.  My mom is too poor to help me pay for college.  Maybe taking other classes at the same time was a mistake, but I'm not psychic.  I don't understand why the due date couldn't have been next week, when classes actually end.  I feel guilty for resting over Thanksgiving break when I apparently should have kept my nose to the grindstone.  I shouldn't have cooked anything, I should have begged my mom to not invite my obnoxious uncle over, I should have spent every day that the library was open in the library- there was no real break, but I was too naive and burnt out from previous weeks to see that.  I actually did study over the break- just lightly, because I thought that was okay.I feel stupid and irresponsible.  I feel like I'm getting what I deserve.  People will always judge me as adjectives rather than circumstances.  I actually found the course extremely interesting, but I just couldn't keep up in the end.  Experiences like this lower my sense of self-efficacy.  They show me that success in life is largely out of my control.  The subject was central to my identity- it was about globalization and policy.  A C is what I'll have to show for it.  I could have written a stellar paper if I had just one more week, and I think we all deserve one more week because that's when most other finals happen and this assignment was a massive 12-15 page research paper on what we'd recommend to solve very large scale problems with no clear solutions. I wasted hours and hours researching how to reform American K-12 schools only to find that the poverty in some schools was driving down the average test scores of all of them.  The answer I found was preschool- nobody talks about that.  It isn't in the news.  All the talk is about funding and understaffing.  Apparently, the economic inequality in the US is so severe that it screws up poor kids for life, and excellent preschools give them the early stimulation that their parents can't give them.  How they perform in kindergarten compared to their wealthier peers actually predicts how likely they are to not graduate from high school, but nobody talks about that. It makes sense now, but it took me so long just to arrive at that solution.  I only had two weeks, counting Thanksgiving break, plus other classes, plus work, plus my crazy uncle, plus my car breaking down an hour away, and plus having to wake up too early to drive my mom to work because we're all sharing one car now.

"About 2 months ago i broke my knee in half and had to have surgery. While i was in the hospital i met this nurse, who id later fall in love with. I told her everything about me. We did MDMA together. I had been in relationships before but this was different. She was my favorite person, i was willing to put my life on hold to be with her. I wanted to join the military, and live on the coast. To me it wasn't my goal but my dream. I hate the mid-west. For her i decided i wasn't going to do that, instead id move down to bowling green, KY. The last place id ever see myself going or even want to go. But i would do it for her. Maybe we rushed things. But we really clicked that well. At least i thought we did.4 days ago she left her apple watch at my house and i found out she was still texting her ex. I told him immediately what was going on, how she was cheating. He did not know and was probably more hurt than me, they were together for 3.5 years. He had some idea but wasn't sure. Poor guy. I felt terrible. He even got her the apple watch. I was scarred to tell him honestly, i'm a small guy and he could kick my ass. Hell from what i heard about him i figured he would. But he appreciated me telling him. It was the least i could do. More than anything i wish it would have been the other way around. That i was the one been cheating on after 3.5 years instead of 2 months. It hurts me knowing i did that to someone. I cant imagine how bad it feels. If i was in his situation i may have killed myself.These past few days I've been drinking, taking hydrocodone, and etizolam non stop. Time feels like its been moving by differently. Almost faster. Its more bearable. I don't think i am suicidal, but I've been having these thoughts. That if something happens to me from all this i don't really care. The only thing that was stopped me from out right killing myself is my dog. Shes like my kid. I either get cheated on or left in every relationship I've been in. This feels like the final blow. Like this is the standard.She has been trying to text me, it feels like fucking harassment. I would block her and she would text me from a different number. I bet she is reading this considering she has my Reddit username. She keeps trying to justify it. Id like to know why, but i realized its not worth thinking about. The why does not really matter at the end of the day. It's just what it is. ","1"

"I get bad motion sickness. My entire childhood I would focus on faraway objects instead of the road. At 18 I wouldn't know how to give directions to my house even though it's like 5 miles. Didn't understand road signs or how to merge etc, just tried really hard not to puke. No one took the time to teach me, either. Yes, I've tried Dramamine. It's not even just the car that makes me sick, it's the flashing sunlight through the trees. Like a strobe light. Watching tv at night, and certain games do the same thing.The summer before last, I tried pot. Noticed it took the nausea away and I enjoyed car rides quite a bit. I could actually look and see what's going on around me. Got a bottle of CBD oil a few months ago so I wouldn't have to smoke every time I get in the car, works great. Felt inspired to finally learn how to drive. Failed my learners test twice in a row and got discouraged. I want to give it another go, right now, but it's so hard. I lack common sense when it comes to the road, I literally spent my entire life looking at the clouds, and I still can't give or understand directions when people ask me. My parents are just as useless as I am. My father is an actual homeless bum and my mother is a drug addict who gave up custody of me when I was 6. I grew up in multiple households and was never really taught how to do many basic things. I do have a sister, but we don't know each other very well and she already has her hands full with her 7 children. I know how unbelievable this sounds, and I'm not even sharing the other tragedies in my childhood but please just believe me.My husband has been taking care of me since I was 18. We have three children. He has PTSD and is rated 100% disabled by the VA. He gets benefits that put a roof over our heads and pay our major bills. He does not work, because it puts too much pressure on him and it worsens his condition. Which means I have to work, and I'm happy to, but I can't drive. He does not have the patience to teach me. I completely rely on him for everything. I've lost several jobs for lateness, because he is very slow in the morning. I want to say it's not his fault, but he stays up until 2am playing video games and chatting up girls on okcupid. I started a new job recently and love it, but we got into a fight yesterday because we were running late (he wouldn't get out of bed) and he wanted me to eat before going into work. I told him there was no time and I don't want to get fired, but he pulled into a McDonald's drive thru anyway. I had time to eat half a hash brown before he parked in front of my work and he got angry when I gave the rest of the food to him. He doesn't understand how to prioritize some things. I ended up getting a warning from my boss. I have no friends, because he always ends up trying to fuck them (he is a serial cheater). He's even invited two of his female friends to live with us, both without asking me how I felt about it. He doesnt want to go on dates with me, even if it's free. Our sex life is a joke. His idea of foreplay is wiggling his cock in my face or saying, ""Gimme some."" He doesn't give me orgasms and doesn't understand why I'm no longer enthusiastic about getting on my knees for him. He will get angry with me and treat me like shit if I deny him. After I do what he wants, he goes back to his games and talking to girls. He falls asleep on the couch most nights, just passes out wherever he is.I don't talk to anyone or go anywhere. I have zero friends, really. I don't even make eye contact with other men my age. I've fantasized about having a license, leaving him, getting my own place and entering the dating scene. I'm often told by people that I'm pretty, but they don't know how hideous my stretch marks are from having three c-sections. If I were to meet a man, I wouldn't be able to undress in front of him. Yeah yeah guys don't care about stretch marks, sure. But I will still feel inferior to other women, it will feel like I'm a downgrade and I would feel sorry for whoever gets stuck with me. I'm alone but I want to escape. My husband's family has money, if I were to leave, he'd win custody of our children because I wouldn't have a stable place for them to live. I try to look past his faults because I know how worthless I am, and I have faults of my own, but it's getting harder. I just really want to die, I've tried getting help and they put me in the hospital for two days, twisted around everything I said and acted like I was an actual threat to myself, and sent me home with a prescription. My husband got tired of taking me to therapy after the second session.I'm really tired, I love my children but I can't even drive them to a fucking doctors appointment. I love my job, but whenever my coworkers ask me questions about myself or want to chit chat, I have nothing to say. I don't know why I'm even posting here, I doubt I'll follow through with any advice. I don't know what else to say, so I'll just submit this post. Sorry for the jumbled mess, thanks in advance to whoever reads this. Please don't link me to a suicide hotline. I'm not going to kill myself. ","1"

I can't stay committed to an exercise routine for more than a few days. I'm awful at drawing and painting. I can't commit to completing a single programming project. I want to be good at something. There's so many things that interest me and I just wish I could fucking stick to one and get good at it. But I can't. I always give up and I hate myself for it. ","1"
"The fear is hitting me hard that my fiancee is planning to move out of town. With or without me. I told her I don't want to move away from the city we live in, but my opinion doesn't seem to matter and she's still looking for a place. Plus friends are coming to me on her plans, and she doesn't seem to want to talk to me about them.My relationship at best is currently unstable.I'm currently on her Welfare file as a dependant meaning all the money comes in under her name, so I got nothing to pay for to fight for my daughter.It feels like her family hates me if they are putting this idea in her ear as she's out of town with them currently.I don't want to get friends in the middle of this, it's not their fight/problem. But I need to talk with more people about it to figure out what I'm going to try to do.","1"
"im 22, i live with my parents. i have a part time job but other than that i really just play video games and spend time with my boyfriend. i woke up this morning and went downstairs and my mom decided to have this big talk with me about how if im unhappy with my life i need to do things to change it and im not working towards any goals. except ! i am ! im not happy with my job and even though im not looking for a new one now theres reason for that! im gonna be a keyholder soon, which looks good on a resume and it also looks bad for me to have 3 jobs all lasting less than a year so im waiting stuff out for my resume to look better. then she told me i need to take a break. but thats not how life works? you cant just take a break from everything? especially when you have a job and even if you could it doesnt matter! because as soon as that breaks over youre going back to the same shit that made you unhappy in the first place! and im just wasting my life away playing video games in my room and talking to people on the internet but i need to find real friends that i can go out and do things with but i dont even LIKE going out and maybe i should go back to school but that sounds like a mental breakdown waiting to happen because its been that way literally every other time ive tried to go back to school and idk im ranting now im just super annoyed with everything right nowTL;DR: dont try to tell people what they need to do with their life when theyre already trying their best to get things done ","1"

"Today was going quite well. I was quite productive till around 4 pm. Now I feel so low and worthless. My friends were seated near me doing a course project and they were talking about going to a bar. It wasnt that they completely ignored me. Every now and then I would jump into the conversation. But theyve now left and they didnt even ask if I wanted to come. Im sure they didnt mean to ignore me, they just thought I was busy. Still it kind of hurts that none of them even asked. I always say yes when people ask me to come with them for dinner or drinks or a movie because its pretty rare. It makes me so happy to know that someone thought of me for a moment. When they dont think of me when Im right in front of them, it sucks. ","1"
"This year has been many things, although I really don't know anything anymore. I feel like I'm going insane, although I feel content. I used to know what my emotions were, what I enjoyed, what I disliked, all of that. Lately it's just been a blur to me. I suppose if it's worth mentioning, I had depression for about a year and a half.. or so, I finally ""fixed"" myself at the beginning of this year by force, although I'm not sure if it worked out for the best. I've gone through a lot, at least I tell myself I have in my mind, and now I feel as if I'm fading. Not going back into depression necessarily, not anything like that, I mean fading as a person. I'm losing my humanity and my will do to... anything. I guess it's kind of what you hear a lot, everything I enjoy is becoming dull to me now, and this has happened before, although it's been lasting a lot longer this time. Video games are still slightly appealing, although I feel like I don't have enough time to do everything I want with them. Music is nice, I love music and all, but that's beginning to fade. All I listen to now anyways is the kind of music that makes you feel nostalgic / melancholy, so I dunno. It helps clear my mind, not worsen my mood. I don't think anything I've written makes sense, I'm sorry for that, I feel like I'm being haunted in my own mind. I've always been a shy person but this year I've really changed that, but at the same time, I've lost absolutely every last bit of desire I ever had to have a ""friendship"" with someone. I'm in a relationship, but friends are not what I want anymore. I just want nothing. I feel like I've realized that friends lie too much, will leave too soon, aren't there for you, all that.. but maybe I'm picking the wrong friends. I seem to be attracted to the wrong kind of people for myself I guess. I really wish I knew what to do with my life, I don't want to end it or anything, I just feel done. Empty, and well.. kind of lonely, but I don't mind that.. I feel as if whenever I speak about this to myself in my mind or my girlfriend, or even others, I just go blank and I honestly don't know what to think of myself anymore. I hate it and I wish I could be okay again, but okay with doing things. Not just okay in an ""I feel empty but I'm content now"" way.","1"

"I broke up with my emotionally abusive boyfriend over the summer which made me start school off on the wrong foot. That on top of a bunch of other things such as feeling excluded by my two best friends have caused me to become depressed and lose all motivation to do anything, including school work, and so for that reason I have decided to medically withdraw from this semester. I confronted my friends but went about it completely wrong and attacked them/blamed them for causing my depression and my medical withdrawal. I have since apologized but now they wont even talk to me which causes me to be even more depressed. Im still at school auditing my classes but having no responsibilities or friends have made it so hard to do anything but lay in bed all day. I have hopes for next semester  but until then I dont know what to do. One of my friends who will no longer speak to me is my roommate so you can imagine how incredibly awkward that is. Im torn between trying to mend me relationship or saying fuck them and moving on considering they significantly contributed to the intensity of my depression and now want nothing to do with me at my lowest point. I just dont know what to do other than sit and be sad, any advice would be so appreciated.","1"

"Not sure how many of can actually relate but here's my situation. Recently the person I've been closest to in my family died, tbh I thought I'd be okay knowing this is apart of life. It's important to mention I've left high school to do online school  (I want grad a little early) but when I left hs, my friends ditched me too. Which wasn't so bad considering I lost much more now, however these feelings of feeling deserted hit when I started reaching out to my closest friend(ive known for 10 years) I could catch in the way he was speaking to me was pitty or that he looks down to me now, when in retrospect, he's had it as tough as me growing up so why can't you understand or take me serious?I get it though, he pulls more girls than me, makes more money than me and carries himself better. That's my brother, I love that kid, but its like he should of all people understand what I'm going through. It's like being a genuine friend or even the women in my life, love is a foreign concept. And that helplessness just hurts, feeling nobody could relate to my hurt. And it's a little hard for me to distinguish if I'm making this shit up or I'm actually being clowned by people I consider family. Also for time frame, this stretches over a month.","1"

"I've been a panic disorder and depression sufferer for years. My attacks have been more frequent and I don't socialise at all any more. Everything has sort of turned into anger and very much 'fck everyone and everything attitude'. The littlest things bother me about the society we have become and I just have a lot of hatred.Having been a sufferer of eating disorder as well, this anger is often focused on anti-skinniness in a world which promotes starvation. I am all for eating until your full as I have first hand been victim to health problems from being told to lose weight. I suffered heart problems and malnutrition from being underweight after shedding too many pounds for fourteen months (I weighed 103 llbs (about 46kg)). There is just such an accumulation of anger towards the world and myself, most days I don't even want to be around anymore. I have had counselling and SSRIs but ultimately, it's just who I am.

"i was born a son to my dad, a local politician, and my mom, currently working in a company's administration department. i had a really odd childhood. i remember being very quiet and calm, but also very angry. my mom used to spoil me a lot, she bought me everything i wanted and always let me win in games we played together. i didn't know what frustration was for the longest time, and was really used to always get what i wanted, and when that wasn't the case i'd get really angry, and i mean really angry, not just a normal child tantrum. i probably learned this from my mom, who gets angry and shouts at everything, even the most insignificant of things, she's been this way since i can remember. my classmates back in kindergarten used to make fun of me and i would get so angry and that would amuse them so they'd bully me more, then i'd go to the teacher so he/she would scold them for bullying me which made them hate me and bully me even more. i hated it. i was extremely serious-minded, and even the slightest joke against me made me scream with anger. my only friend was this kid (who is still my friend today) who at one point started bullying me too in order to get along with the other kids this made me slowly get away from all my classmates and i'd always be alone in break time. i hated breaks because i'd be so bored and it would be embarrassing to be alone, to be the kid with no friends. at age 3 i used a computer for the first time, and it became my world. i had no social life basically, and lived inside my virtual world, barely ever went out of the house. all of this lasted throughout all of primary and middle school. my dad was never really present, as he was with my mom but didn't live with us because of his job, and left my mom when i was 12, after which i never saw him very often again. my problems with anger persisted as the years passed by, and started hating going to school more and more each passing day. anxiety also started being a big problem for me, and still persists to this day. i've always felt like i was the weird kid and constantly desired to be like everyone else, to be accepted by others, to not be bullied and/or ignored by my peers.this is the small bit that i remember from my childhood, because i've forgotten most of it. i really believe that it was really traumatizing. i am 18 now and i've figured out that all these things are what made me develop into a lazy, depressed, angry, empty shell of a human being. later in life i'd find many, many friends who would later abandon me (or so i would think from their actions) which, combined with my dad's abandonment, made me develop a deep fear of being abandoned. the fact that i was so spoiled as a kid and so used to instant, effortless gratification, since i always had good grades and was constantly praised for it plus the internet which was my easy way to entertain myself without having to socialize, has made me unable to make an effort for anything. also my lack of socializing made me into the most introverted kid ever, which is something i have just been able to get over slowly since i was 16 and started going to parties and whatnot. when i was 14, i came to the philosophical realization that life is meaningless and that nothing i do actually matters in any way, which also triggered more depressive symptoms in me as time passed.all of this has also caused me a lot of trouble with substance abuse. i discovered marijuana at 15 and since then became an addict, smoking every single day, even when it started being damaging to me and made me have serious problems with my parents (mostly my mom). i also started going to parties and getting fucked up on alcohol and smoking cigarettes pretty much every weekend. at 17 i got into psychedelics and had near death experiences with certain drugs like 25i-NBOMe due to my irresponsible use of these substances. i've thankfully stopped smoking weed, so far i've been clean for 7 days and going strong (hopefully).i am currently in psychiatric treatment, i take 150mg bupropion and 100mg lamotrigine every day, which was prescribed to me as a way to boost my mood, concentration, and energy, since one of the main symptoms of my depression was the fact that i felt completely demotivated and unwilling to do anything, plus excessively sleepy every single day regardless of how much i slept. i was also in therapy for two years until i decided to stop going to it since it was starting to becoming a nuisance and seemed more and more useless to me as time went by.i don't know what to do. i feel empty, anxious and depressed but most of all i feel completely traumatized. it's like all these uncomfortable and sad memories of my childhood still linger in my subconscious and hurt me, but at the same time i can't remember 99% of them, like they're a ghost that's haunting me constantly but at the same time it becomes invisible so i can't fight against it. i've felt this way since i was 12 (although back then i didn't really know why) and it started getting significantly worse around a year ago. i get angry at the smallest things just like my mom does. i want to feel better, i want to be a normal person. i feel like I have a mental handicap, an illness that i just can't fight against. the mental states i get into have started going out of my own control and make me do the stupidest shit. i've cried myself to sleep countless times by now and ripped entire shirts to shreds because of my anger bursts. help me, please, i'm starting to run out of options. it's only a matter of time before my spontaneous desires to kill myself eventually become a reality.","1"
"I'm about 60k in debt thanks to student loans, medical bills (to pay for depression meds and therapy), credit card debt (shopping addiction thanks to PTSD) and a private student loan that fell into collections (thought it was part of my consolidation package, was dead wrong).  My credit score is so awful that I can't get an apartment or home loan so I have to live with my parents still at 30.  I have a full time job that pays well, but since I have so much debt I have zero ability to save any money or even pay more than the minimum amount owed for all of my bills.  I also can't consolidate anything because I get instantly denied so I'm stuck with high payments.  I like my job.  It is perfect for me, so I don't want to try and find a new higher paying one.  Higher salary = more stress and responsibility and I'm at max capacity for both of those right now.  I know my only option is to probably get a second job but I don't know how I'll handle it.  40 hours/week is already too much for me :'(Anybody else struggling with debt, too?

I'm suddenly not worth their friendship anymore, and they're disgusted by me.I don't have any friends anymore, and I'm always lying to the people that still talk to me that I'm okay when I'm actually feeling miserable.I tried seeking help, I spent years in therapy and trying different meds, different doctors, nothing ever helped. I'm a coward and I don't trust anyone anymore, I would never trust a doctor anymore. I feel so lonely and maybe I should make my parents hate me too so I could finally die.

"I have just gotten out of the mental facility here in my city.  I live in Florida. It was a very interesting situation that I did my best to be positive about. Here's how it all started: I woke up feeling very depressed and anxious and told my boss I would not be able to come in. When she began arguing with me, I told her that I was sorry, but I did not want to come to work when I was experiencing bad thoughts (which I guess was a bad thing to say... it could be taken out of context but honestly I just confided in her because she told me I could trust her and she'd always be there to listen if I needed anything, and I just wanted some sympathy.) I told her I was going to go see my therapist and get some help and that is why I wanted a day off. She promptly fired me because she said I was absent too much (I had to take one day off because of a doctor's appointment and one day due to a medical emergency, but I tried to come to work during that day, and she decided to close the office early for the holidays.) I was very upset and begged for my job back, but she told me she was clear on her decision. I applied for some jobs from my laptop and decided to take a nap, only to wake up to three officers at my door. I was very confused and afraid. They informed me my boss had told them I told her I was experiencing suicidal thoughts and was worried I'd hurt myself. This was hard to swallow. I informed them I was fine, and that I did not mean to worry anyone, and I only turned to her because she expressed that she'd always be willing to listen if needed. I felt as though I could trust her, and I feel very stupid for doing so. I was calm when the police came into my home, but they told me they had to take me to the hospital. At this point, I was terrified. I was shaking as they told me to put on clothes and gather my things. Now, I've never been to a facility before, and they had me convinced that I was only going to get checked out for a couple hours. I was hoping that the intake staff there would dismiss me. I have struggled with depression and anxiety, but I have never felt suicidal and I've actually been on an amazing road to recovery since this summer, with no issues at all. So this really floored me. I was put in the facility for three days. I was so upset at first, but as I realized there was nothing I could do about it, I accepted my fate and stayed positive. I was polite to the staff and treated everyone respectfully, followed the rules and participated in some really neat group activities. It really wasn't a terrible experience. I actually really had a lot of fun considering. I was in an inpatient program that was much less intimidating than I expected. My meals were taken care of, as I do not eat meat, I got to take hot showers and I slept like a baby after taking a sleep aid I requested from the nurse. I did cool art therapy sessions and kept busy by reading books. I wasn't happy I was in there, but I was determined to make the best of it. I just want to write this to let everyone know to be careful. I told this boss out of confidentiality that I was struggling, and she betrayed me... I understand I can't just blab about mental illness to anyone, but I figured I'd be okay under the american disability act to receive reasonable accomodation, as I wanted to take that day off to go see my counselor, who I hadn't seen in weeks because of his holiday plans. It upset me that even though I was taking action for what they thought was a problem, I was still taken away.But there is nothing wrong with that. Everyone struggles. This was just another experience for me. But, it held me back so much, as I had finals this week and projects due this week... and my boss was well aware of that... she made things so much more difficult for me. Thankfully, I talked to my professors and they really have pulled together to be flexible and I am permitted to take my exams and turn in my projects next week. I have come a long way through my recovery from depression and anxiety, and while this was a huge setback, I will not let it break me. I was prescribed a small antianxiety pill that I will take as needed and will continue to see my therapist. I was thinking of pursuing the issue legally but not sure if I have time or funds... Just wanted to vent. Thank you.","1"
"I have been depressed since I was ~9, severely depressed since I was 12, I'm 19 now. I genuinely can't remember a time I was happy in a lasting way. I was so severely depressed in high school I never made friends or developed interests. I would just go to school, come home, do my work, go to my job, and sleep. I didn't even play video games, listen to music, or watch TV. I did nothing. I don't have memories from high school. I've started telling people I meet (who I know I'll never meet again) that I was in a coma for a few years and it's basically fucking true.Every single person I know has something they're interested in. Something they're knowledgeable about, something they seek out on their own time. For me, if I have free time, I sleep or play with my rabbits. I also have almost no memory or attention span so even when I try to get into things, or talk about things i'm slightly interested in, like literature and music, I can't remember names or albums or genres and I just come off sounding like a poser. I don't get references to popular movies or TV shows, I didn't have a Smiths phase in high school, I genuinely feel like I can't relate to others.I feel like I'm at least 7 years younger than everyone around me. I didn't socialize at all in high school so I'm extremely awkward and uninteresting and I never know how to respond to what people say. I don't know how to seek out my interests because my college town is tiny and rainy so I never feel like going outside. Right now I'm in school for essentially human trafficking relief and most of my extracurricular life revolves around a project relating to child pornography so no one wants to talk or socialize and I for damn sure don't want to talk about that at parties. Other than that I have no skills, nothing to show for my nineteen pathetic years of existence.Has anyone overcome this? I just wish I had something I cared about, something I could hold onto that made me seem like a human being and not just depression, embodied. ","1"

So some backstory about me, I am in the military currently working in the intelligence field, it's a very anti social crowd that does not mesh well with my personality, I LOVE people, as in I care about every person around me. I am incredibly sociable. I will introduce myself to whoever is relevant and will take every opportunity to build friendships, the problem is that these friendships end in nothing more than me being a ""fun guy to have around with"" I just don't know what else I can do. I go out to bars and buy people drinks, I get to know their story, they get to know mine. I will see them every weekend and maintain communication throughout the week. But at the end of the day I am never invited anywhere yet I am always welcome. I care a lot about people, more than I should, it's unhealthy. I am not bragging about how good of a person I am. It's to just kind of show where I am coming from. I want people to care about me. Something I am really missing right now and I don't know how to fix it. This post is mostly an outlet for me.

Work, my mother who don't give me the space to live, and then there was an abusive boyfriend an a narcissistic friend.I got medication for my depression, the anxiety disorder, the character disorder, they also made the diagnosis of a cognitive disorder.The therapy helped me a lot, nearly a month ago I managed it to move into my own flat, and all was so... easy. So warm, bright. I could do whatever I want to, at work everything was fine....till yesterday.Suddenly I am missing that narcissistic friend, could not help my best friend with her problems, feeling ugly, that I never will live a normal life...The pressure to do self harm grows, I feel like I am useless... that I have no right to live, that there is no task for me. That I will be alone forever, and everything is getting darker and darker per hour.I can't find a therapist here in my town, and I have no car to move to another.I just want to cry, but I can't do that without hurting myself, I hate myself for missing that friend, dealing with the idea to forgive my mother for everything, that my problems with cleaning my flat come back and I'm living in dirt again...Why do I have so much diseases? Why can't I simply love somebody? Why I am afraid when someone is touching me? Or being afraid with a lot of people around me..?I am falling, drowning..","1"

Still, I've searched and skimmed but haven't really found anything, so I'm asking all the same.For more details, I'm an aspiring writer.

"Im just bouncing around reddit now trying to find something to care about. Everyone seems to have that one thing where theyre like I always wish I couldve done X thing, but never did. I dont even feel like I lack in motivation, I just really dont have anything Id want to do with my time outside of college. And now its not even just with life goals, its hobbies to; Ill just sit on my Xbox home screen and look at the games, not even being able to get myself to play anything, even when I do its just me going through the motions. Ive actually put myself into situations and tried stuff as well but none of it sticks. I hate this and its not helping the suicide thing much when I have no meaning or aim. I want something to aspire towards, something where I feel like I couldnt do it unless I absolutely applied myself towards but theres just nothing anymore. Any help would be lovely, thanks.","1"
"I've been doing ECT for about three months now, and i am starting to feel a bit better. Not perfect, still far from ""normal,"" but better.However, now reality is starting to really set in. I am realizing that, for the past twelve years, my mental issues have completely ruled my life and defined who I was/am. I don't have a very good history with jobs and colleges, and I have completely isolated myself. So I guess my question is: what now? I am 23 and don't have the faintest idea of who I am or what I should be doing. How do I start moving forward? How do I begin picking up the pieces of my life that I have destroyed? I dunno. I guess, if any of you guys have moved on from your mental issues, I would love to know how you did it. I feel better, but I think I'm more lost than ever.","1"

"Idk why I'm posting honestly. I guess I don't have another outlet and simply crying at work isn't a good idea. Might even get me fired. Who knows.I've been feeling this overwhelming darkness and loneliness coming for a few days. Thought it might pass. Of course it fucking didn't. That would've been much too easy and encouraged.I feel like a burden to the grand majority of my friends. Most of them have ducked out of my life due to this depression. It's been a little crazy over the last few months, but didn't expect to lose about 90% of the people in my life because of it.They always say you can count on your friends when the going gets rough. But this has taught me that you can't. They tell you you can out of courtesy. But please don't burden them with your garbage and insecurities and paranoid and anxiety. Anything but that.I've even started to doubt if my own family wants to deal with me. The family who's usually there for me. I can see it in their eyes; they don't want to listen to this. What happened to the cheery guy that used to make us laugh?Well he died. And the recent abandonment isn't going to bring him back.It feels like a darkness, large and overwhelming and all-enveloping, is blanketing over me. It subjugate whatever it touches. Turns it all to ash. Nothing exists but this darkness. If only a light could come clear it up..But those are gone. Good luck now..","1"

"I cry everyday. There is almost no day I don't think about suicide. It's going to be a year in this situation. In some way I know I won't kill myself ever, but to deal with these thoughts every day it's exhausting. I want to go to a therapist, but I'm not sure how much time I'm staying in this city. I started visiting one in my former city and then I had to move to this place before ending my therapy. I have shared my problems with a few friends, but they are not being very helpful. I can only call them once a week or so, and the truth is nobody wants to hear about depression. I have noticed some of them turn down the conversation when I start complaining or telling about my problems. I would like to trust on my family, but my parents are very anxious and they already had to deal with my sister's anorexia 3 years ago. So I feel guilty to not be ok and to cause them a new problem. I'm already 30 years old after all. I know I need more help than reddit, but the truth is it's here where I find some support.","1"
"I'm not here to get anyone's pity or to feel sorry for me. I've just come to the realization that I'm not ment to be with anyone. I've been curious about the same gender for a little bit, so with a help of a friend I've been going to a gay bar for a while. Though I never get a positive response. The guys I interact with never return my texts. I saw both of them tonight with othet guys. I get it, there's no law that says that they have to be attractive to me. But the fact that they falsely lead me and hurts me. They made me feel special being noticed, which is a big deal for me. But why do that if they were truly not interested? Why give me their number if they never planned to reply? Why give me that? I hate getting excited when I see a text only to be let down when it's not from them. Perhaps I don't handle rejection well, but that's just me. I can't help it.The only girl who I believed ever truly understood me doesn't feel the same why. I would rather not have a friendship with her than to chase something I know I will never have. It sucks because no other girl or guy compares to her.But oh well I guess. I wish I knew this sooner.

"I often have crying fits thinking about my parents or boyfriend dying. The thoughts are difficult to block out. I'm having one right now. I wake up every day thinking that someone could have gotten in a car crash. Or how my parents have only 40 to 50 more years of real life left. Or how I may only have my boyfriend until 50 because he won't take care of himself, if he doesn't kill himself before even then. I'm excited for my own death but terrified of everyone else's.

It explained how some people would just come here after bad stuff happens to them, meanwhile people have been wanting to end it for decades. I, as many others, envy those.

"If a normal person breaks up with his girlfriend, he and his ex becomes friends and they still keep in touch with each other once in a while. Between relationships, he hooks up and sleeps with multiple girls and he manages to get another girlfriend in a couple months. The cycle of a normal person continues.Me: A girl that I dated for a couple months in 2016 loses interest and cut off all contact with me. I am a person that is not worth keeping in touch with. This whole year consists of me going to work in the morning and coming home at night to play(and be bad at) video games, looking at porn, and looking at Facebook to see my friends being happy with their SOs or doing fun things socially.For the first time ever, I dated somebody off of Tinder. The date went fine, but I already knew she wouldn't be interested in another date. It is me after all(a boring piece of shit)  I tried calling her: ""hey! I'll call you back!""

"I work my dream job but I have had to sit five feet from my ex for the past six months. She is my best friend and who I thought I was going to grow old with but I made a mistake. She has been seeing a kid with a cosseting mother, four hours away in school who openly hates her music, entertainment preferences and wants to change her. I told her I would move to home with her to her home state and instead she choose this MS2 from her alma mater. She has claimed she wants to do right by me but she has never hid her relationship or weekends visits driving four hours away to go see the guy she replaced me with. I know medical school kills long distance relationships but I am afraid I cannot hold on much longer. It is torture sitting next to her, seeing her smile, still smelling her perfume, not being able to tend to her when she is sick and working with her occasionally. I have been praying to god to just hit me with a car on my walk home. It is the only way I think I can find peace.

"My SO was recently diagnosed with major depression. They wanted to make him inpatient but settled for a partial hospitalization program, which is outpatient 5 days per week, all day. He is either going to be discharged this week or next week and go to just seeing a therapist plus our GP to manage meds. He seems scared about being done, and I was looking for advice on how to help make the transition back to life easier. He is unemployed, and I work overnight 3 to 4 shifts (12 hours) a week. I try to spend time with him, but it can be tough because I'm usually tired and dealing with mild depression and chronic headaches myself!

"Formatting may be shit, this is my first real post on Reddit, and I'm not bothering to test the formatting rigorously before posting. Fuck it.So, I have a thing (.txt file) wherein I write opinions and such if they come to me at a convenient time -- which has been three times, as it turns out. I though I would post the three entries I've written, since maybe people will read it and subsequently tell me if I'm being a dumbass or not. There's some vulgar language, and some very roundabout sentences with very little point, but I've tried to keep everything in because otherwise I would be lying, and what's the point in that?I appologize if I sound pretentious, snowflake-y, or otherwise. On with the show.Thoughts on romance, feelings, the future, and self-worthI, in general, don't feel very happy; can I say I'm depressed? Probably not, no. I wouldn't want to, either, since I feel it would be a disgrace to those who have been properly diagnosed. All I've done is take the occasional online test when I feel at my worst.Depressed people typically talk about an empty feeling, or something similar to that. I don't think I've ever felt that; similarly, those with depression talk about being dull to emotions, which I don't think applies to me in the sense that I've always been kind of adverse to feeling.I find that my emotions go up and down, in an almost sine-wave form. This would be something more like bipolar disorder, but then that typically requires that the periods of time where I feel manic/depressed are relatively long, or that I feel manic at all. I can go from feeling perfectly okay, to feeling like I want to fucking die in approximately 15 seconds, and it might stay that way for hours but never longer than that. So it's not bipolar disorder.Depression gets ruled out again, as those who are depressed typically report always feeling like shit -- and I don't.I feel perfectly fine _most_ of the time, such as at school or with friends -- very rarely do I feel properly shit in these situations -- while as soon as I am put in a situation where I am alone, the bad feelings return. This typically results in very long nights of just staring at the ceiling wanting to die because I feel pointless. Other descriptors are available -- hopeless, useless, etc.Of course, it could just be hormones doing their thing.I look at /r/depression sometimes -- to see whether there's anyone who feels the way I do. Some complain about not having a girlfriend (inb4 mfw no gf), some complain that their lives are shit nonetheless. Those who complain about not having a girlfriend typically complain about being rejected by the one they like, or in general just unreciprocated love. I am in a relatively strange situation, I suppose, as I complain about not having a girlfriend but I also do not like anyone. I've never had an actual crush, nor love interest. There was a point when I thought I had a crush, but honestly I think I just went along with what I was supposed to do at my age.Now, of course there are plenty of girls I know that I would -- for lack of a better term -- like to fuck. Sexual attraction is not so much a problem, but I've never felt romantic love for someone, nor do I think anyone has felt romantic attraction towards me. These facts hurt me more than I feel they should, seeing as I put up a front of complete uncaring. I suppose that isn't so strange -- there are, in fact, very few things I care about -- but I thinkpeople like to judge me as an uncaring person, and then leave it at that; I don't exactly make it any easier for them to not do that, though. It's not like I have any form of social interaction.When I think of the future, I have great difficulty seeing myself in any other situation than complete loneliness.I mean, after I finish the (Generic School Program^TM), I doubt I'll be seeing most of my current friends ever again.On top of that, I don't think I can get new ones, so I see myself at 30, sitting in an empty, dark room contemplating suicide for 8 hours/day.Exactly how things will change I don't know, and honestly, I don't think they will. I think, however, that it would be a waste of life to just end it here, when I've only just turned 17 about a month and a half ago, and I should wait until there is some certainty that things aren't going to work out.I guess in reality, all I'm looking for is some meaning stemming from others. Since nothing has any inherent meaning, to assign meaning to actions you require the help of others. As such, whenever I make or do something, I would want feedback on it; some determination of its worth to tell me if I've wasted my time or not. To tell me if I'm making some kind of useful contribution to this world, no matter how small.Simple, right?Further thoughts on the possibility of a relationship -- or lack of oneWhat I've learnt by reading things on the internet is that if you speculate that you will never have a romantic partner, people will always respond by saying that you will eventually meet someone who likes you. I wonder if this is really true -- I mean, sure, statistically this is probably true for the overall population, but I'm not exactly part of the general population. I don't mean that in a ""oh, I'm special"" kind of way, but rather in a bad way.I mean, I'm fat, at most average looking, weak and I have relatively uncommon hobbies (mathematics, primarily). This means that finding someone who will be quite happy to hear me ramble on about some complex analysis bullshit is rather unlikely. Most people don't want to sit and talk about mathematics for hours on end (of course, the discussion on why people dislike mathematics so much is far too long to fit in this little entry), and I am quite annoyed by people who fake interest or joy. It just makes me feel bad -- I'm both boring the person, and I'm learning that my efforts to talk were completely pointless. This means I can sometimes be somewhat demanding regarding the reasoning for liking something I've done, as I simply don't trust that you do.A second reason I will likely not find a romantic partner is of course that you need to meet people for that to happen; I'm incredibly anti-social, as you may know. On top of that, a third reason is that if I somehow do find someone, maintaining a relationship isn't exactly trivial. I'm not sure I am even capable of it. First of all, you need to interact with the person on a regular interval -- which would be a problem for me. Second of all, sincerelationships are a two way street, it is quite easy to be emotionally dependent on the person and that can be quite mentally draining I would imagine, which decreases the chance of the relationship staying a relationship.I feel stupid for even existing.Thoughts on social paranoia(?) and friendshipsPerhaps social paranoia isn't the right term. Perhaps it's just pessimism, cynisism, or any other such -ism. Point is that I tend to feel sort of paranoid about people's opinion of me. In an unhealthy way, that is.I've found that I'm fully incapable of trusting what people tell me. When people tell me things, I tend to mentally tell myself that the person is just going along with the flow of the conversation to get it over with. For example, if I ask someone if I'm an overall good person, and the person says ""yes"", I will not believe them. I just won't be able to, because it feels more likely to me that they would be saying the easiest thing just to get the conversation over with as quickly as possible. So I feel paranoid and kind of shit because of this. The concept reminds me a bitof a Kafka trap. The more you assure me of what your point is, the less I believe you. A particularly annoying part about this is that it contributes to my need for acknowledgement by my peers, and as such is part of the reason I might repeatedly ask the same question to one person, which can be quite annoying I would imagine. Then the problem is that I can't really ask something -- going back to the previous example -- like""are you sure you're not just saying that to end the conversation topic as fast as possible?"" because the person would likely -- and rightfully -- assume that I'm making undue assumptions about them.A consequence of this paranoid behavior is, for example, that while I believe myself to have close friends, I assumethat I am no one's close friend.An example of this behavior happening just today is that my friend, who I will refer to as A, asked -- on the behalf of ""a group of 10-12 people"" -- whether I liked a girl whom I occasionally talk to at school -- one who most people, as I found out, find annoying. Now, the answer was of course ""no"". As mentioned in at least one previous entry, I've never felt any romantic emotions -- which is a source of great stress for me. After I replied, a couple of things were on my mind: Why do I not find this girl particularly annoying while most others find her extremely annoying? Is there anything wrong with my perception of people? Why did people assume I liked this girl because I talk to her, when I practically talk to everyone? Since A replied ""Alrite"", does that mean he believes me, or does it mean he's just saying that to end the somewhat uncomfortable topic?As you can see, I demonstrated this pessimistic, paranoid behavior in a situation where it really shouldn't be that difficult to determine the truth. I mean, A is one of my closest friends, so logically he shouldn't lie to me. However, once again this leads back to my behavior: while he is one of my closest friends, I have no evidence that he even enjoys my company. He might just be lying to me to avoid hurting my feelings unduly, since -- from my perspective -- we've been friends for quite the while.One of the worst things about this is that my brain tells me that perhaps everyone experiences this on a regular basis, and I'm the only one complaining and having my life be affected by it, which makes me feel like a massive piece of shit.On a semi-related note: I have no idea why anyone is friends with me. I'm a fuckin' asshole and I complain about things. I'm probably at least annoying.So, why are people friends with me? My brain says they're not, and that they're just lying to me in a rather well planned attempt at fuckin' with me.I feel fuckin' trapped. At least I still have a sense of humour.","1"

"I dont know why Im writing this, Ive never wrote about my feelings or anything like that. Maybe I want to get my feelings in writing to help myself understand.I have friends I think. I hang out with people at my university, and when I go back home I spend time with my friends from high school. Yet most my life I havent felt like people have truly wanted me in their life. People still invite me to events and such, but this feeling stems from the little things.Its hard for me to explain the little things that make me feel unwanted. These little things are instances that in themselves are insignificant. Yet over time, such as when I reflect on the events of an entire week, it becomes clear that I am the lowest on the totem poll. Think of it like this, if 4 friends and myself were walking on a sidewalk that could only fit 3 people, I would be the odd man out. Its trivial situations like these that happen every day that really wear me down. At the same time, I see why Im the odd man out, I just cant seem to do anything about it. I say stupid things sometimes. Words that have no ill intent, yet the meaning is often lost. Id say the meaning is lost partly due to me just being dumb sometimes and partly due to my friends simply having a disposition to inperpret what I say in a certain way. Something in particular that hurts is the relationship between a close friend from high school that goes to my university, my roommate, and myself. I introduced my high school friend to my roommate, and now we all hangout because we relate on many things. As the semester has progressed, both my roommate and my friend have bonded well. But what hurts is that they clearly prefer each other over me. Once again, this shows in the little interactions we share, and I feel like a third wheel every day. They most certiantly arent in the wrong for preferring each other over me. Im angry at myself here. I wish I had someone that wanted to be with me, regardless of who else was around.Ive struggled with feeling like this since middle school, and Ive pushed through because I always told myself things would get better. They said high school would change things. Then they said college would change things. Well now Im in college and nothing has really changed. I cant think of a day thats gone by in which I dont think about ending my life. Moreover, the thoughts have been getting worse. Theyve gone from wondering what the world would be like without me, to thinking about how I specifically would go about doing it. Ive wanted to be with those around me, but it feels like those around me dont want to be with me. I want to be wanted.Maybe no one will read this, but I guess it feels good to get it out.","1"

"Today I walked in the middle of the road down the yellow divider and I felt a rush for the first time in weeks. The excitement of being on the brink of death is the only good part about life. But a cop stopped me and talked to me. I was super embarrassed. I hate talking about my feelings to strangers but I always seem to put myself in situations that require it. Another time was when I had an absolute mental breakdown when I came back to my dorm room. I was screaming, crying, throwing a fit behind thin walls. Ofc the neighbors called the cops on me and I almost got away with saying it wasnt me, but the bitch across the hall ratted me out. Just like my ex says, Im batshit crazy. Guess its time to wear that insult as armor too huh. ","1"

"So... I've been around the block with my mental health. Figured a lot of stuff out, been in many different places with it over the last few months. Been kinda running at breakneck speeds around the block the last few weeks.My loved one left me. I admitted to them that i had failed again in trying to stop my pornography problem. It was a huge issue for them, and I knew this. I could either defend myself or condemn myself for that whole thing, but in the end it doesn't really matter. It's a behavioral addiction that was a huge struggle to try and stop, especially with the feelings of being shamed for it. But if I wanted to stop BADLY enough, I would have been able to.But regardless, I had managed to decide finally that I was completely done with it, and I was in a very... idk how to explain it. A mindset that was very open and honest with myself, and I really saw that admitting the truth was the right thing to do, or I would contantly feel like I was hiding a secret, even if I did put it entirely behind me. They didn't leave me right away. We said we could work through it, go to therapy, rebuild the lost trust.   A month and a halfish later they told me they wanted to break up. Didn't really have a good open conversation about it, but oh well maybe we can someday, maybe I'll get that closure someday of honest dialogue.But now I'm just cycling, going through everything from collected and optimistic to hopelessness and anger, everything in-between. Past couple of days, I've cycled back to a place of missing them very, very much. I'm still loving them a lot right now, and it really hurts.  I was off of the porn for that period we were still together, and another couple weeks after the break up too. This week I'm back on it though.I'm having trouble finding ways to fight it. Like, I'm not able to argue against 'hey you're just taking care of yourself' or 'what's wrong with giving yourself this pleasure' those kinds of thoughts and feelings. I keep believing I can 'handle it' or stuff like that.I got like, semi-instant karma for it last night. I fucked up somehow and downloaded some movies on my mobile data instead of wifi. 5 gigs at 10 bucks a gig: just completely threw away 50 bucks. Not counting the other 3 or so gigs from watching in the bathroom at work. Its like c'mon, why don't I feel that strongly as obvious signs that this is a bad idea? A poor excuse of a coping mechanism, continuing to feed into my lack of self-confidence and motivation. It's like I do see it, but only half the time. For a few hours until I'm horny again.Like I said, I've been going through cycles, so I've been focusing on other stuff too. Planning for the future, thinking about things I want to do, getting the ball rolling on getting some new healthy habits and stuff. So hopefully I will realize that falling back on this is standing in the way of the changes I want for myself. It's just so hard to go 'OK that's it,  relapse over'.... when there's just so much good fucking porn to watch, you know? Like it sounds stupid but that's the honest feelings. The long term looking out for myself thinking versus the instsant gratification drive. Neither truly needs to be an enemy, I just need balance. And there are other ways to treat yourself in the short-term. It's almost entirely a question of habit. I just have to find that will again. For myself, and no other.","1"

Also, pretending to care and be happy for other people is hard and in my head it's just blowing up so that makes it hard to actually care for other people. I just have to make people think I'm content when really I'm still trying to figure out if it's worth it in life. It's so hard, I can't even go out anymore. I can't look in mirrors, I can't take pictures, I can't stand to look at any body part for more than a few seconds. It's even hard typing this because I get to see my fingers.

"Hello, long time lurker first time poster. I've personally struggled with depression my entire life and am - I think - fingers crossed - starting to work myself out of a dark hole I've been in the past 4 months. I don't want to jinx things, but life seems to be looking up for a change.The whole time I've had the support of my wonderful boyfriend. We're currently long distance  (different countries) and just a few hours ago he opened up to me about how down he's been feeling. It sounds exactly what I was and still kind of am going through.It shattered my heart. I don't want him to feel this way. If I could take it off him and put it on myself I would. I hurt for him. I've never had a significant other struggle with the same thing. I don't know what to do. I want to help but I have no idea how other than listening and talking to him about it. I have no advice. He feels stuck in his current situation and cant do anything about it for another 2 months. If we weren't long distance then I could at least help out with physical things like cleaning up that I know are hard when you're suffering.He feels like everything is gray and boring/no motivation/things are pointless.TL;DR: Any advice on how to help my long distance boyfriend with his depression? It's hard to offer concrete advice when I have similar struggles. How can I help him other than just quietly listening and watching him in pain?","1"

"Sorry, just wanna get a couple of things off my chest. Things have been really rough for a couple of years now and I have no friends or therapists I can approach.I was an unplanned/bastard, mixed child in a closed-minded society so I've been alienated by both family/peers all of my life. Never really had any friends, gave up on doing them years ago. Some years ago a grandma I didn't really know that well got a really aggressive, terminal type of cancer and I was the only one willing to take care of her as she was dying. She had been ostracized by our family since I could remember, but it turned out she might've actually been the sanest, most loving one of us all. She ended up dying in 4 months instead of the suggested 6, so a big chunk of my family blamed me for not ""saving her"". They haven't talked to me ever since.My nana, whom I loved unconditionally and whose death had been my biggest fear since I was born, started dying a few months later. On her deathbed she confessed she hated me, and thought my half brother had had a miserable life simply because I existed. Something definitely broke inside of me then.Later on, things appeared to get better. I got a scholarship and an acceptance letter for college in another country. I was happy to start anew. Now that I'm here I'm having quite a hard time. The institution is corrupt and teachers grade assignments based on affinity with the student. Not good at all considering I've gotten into shit with most of them. I work from 7am-10pm, and commute for 2 hours daily, weekends included. I'm getting seriously sick but still can't get any passing grades simply because I'm not getting friendly with the teachers. I've always been a honor roll student and an obnoxious tryhard so I'm quite convinced it's just the way things work here.Now my dad is going blind and, again, none of my siblings wants to help. I'm just considering dropping out, going back home and helping. He abandoned me when I was pretty small (got back in touch later on) so I'm just... wary. In general I just don't know what to do with my life. Is it really worth continuing?Sorry for the lengthy rant.","1"

Then I dig a grave in the ground but I leave a small opening and a big hole. Then I climb in and shoot myself in the head and  because I left a small opening to the grave, when it rains the dirt will fall over and bury me.

"Today i turned 17. I always get depressed on my birthday. Im supposed to have fun and celebrate but its the time when i feel the loneliest.

In a year ill be studying abroad, all alone in a foreign country. Im afraid its going to kill me. Last time my life changed like that i fell into depression. It was when i switched schools a year ago. Going to college abroad is going to be so much harder. Since i got out of depression ive tried to grow as a person. Cant say i havent made progress but im still very insecure, emotionally unstable and have no life goals. I know i will struggle to make friends in college, mostly because i feel inferior to everyone around me and have no idea how to make meaningful connections. Also i dont have an instagram (obviously because im very insecure about every aspect of my personality), so everyone thinks im a freak. My friends are not coming with me. I have no idea what im gonna do in an entirely new environment with no one to support me. I really dont want for the suicidal thoughts to come back. sorry for ranting, im just really sad. ","1"
"I've come to realize I'm so desperate to fit in that whenever anything goes wrong in the friend group I'm in, I self destruct. I get unreasonably upset at something someone did, in order to justify to myself why I shouldn't hang out with them anymore. Even people I care deeply about. ESPECIALLY people I care deeply about. I push everyone away from me, and then when I realize it I can't fix it so I self medicate away my days with alcohol and cocaine and hope that the pain will go away and that I can be numb. It doesn't work. It never works.I was on my way to something amazing and I ruined it and caused so much hurt and I've tried to fix it but it's too late. I begged on my fucking knees in the group chat (as we're all separated at the moment I couldn't do it IRL) and everyone ignored it.

It wasn't even a cruel laugh but it set me off and I couldn't stop crying and i hid in the toilet and freaked out, i couldn't breath properly, i couldn't stop crying, my teeth wouldn't stop chattering and i wanted to quit my job on the spot and die. The driver was telling me there was an order to be made but i literally couldn't move and eventually i called my manager and just cried down the phone to her and screamed 'how much notice do i need to quit' because it was all i could think. i needed to get out. it was so terrible.It took about 2 hours for my teeth to stop chattering and for the crying to stop and a further hour for me to be able to speak again and my mam took me to the doctor and he didn't give me a sick note which means i have to return to work today (in the next half hour) and carry on with my job as if i didn't just have a massive breakdown in front of everyone.tl:dr I had a breakdown at work yesterday but the doctor wouldn't let me have any time off to recover.","1"

"I apologize for the long ass post but I need to put all of this somewhere. And i have no where else to turn.I am going through a break/break up. Im still not 100 percent where we stand bc she has issues with confrontation( she lies a lot not just to me but everyone in her life) And now has basically refused to talk about feelings or anything about us anymore. She says she needs distance and space from me. But i believe she is cheating. We had an issue at the very beginning of our relationship plus like i said she lies a lot until you show her proof. She had the location history set up on her phone and i looked through it and she was not where she said she was. Then when I show her proof she gets mad bc i am snooping. Its been a never ending cycle for the last 3 years. The ""talk"" happened a month ago and she moved out about a week and a half ago. We hung out twice since she moved out since we are suppose to be trying to make an effort and having ""dates"". Since she told me that she wanted to take a break I have been depressed. I mean i was depressed before but now it has become extreme. I have stopped working the last two weeks and turned in a notice to take a leave of absence for the next month. I physically am unable to go. I drive there and have a panic attack and leave. So i figured i should just stop going instead of having to deal with trying to leave everyday. I didnt like my job before but now it is completely unbareable. I also run a small online business that has completely suffered due to my inability to want to do anything. I am losing out on money during the busiest time of the year. Which makes the depression worse. Besides when i have been out with my ex? I have not left the house or eaten. I have been smoking two packs of cigs a day and drinking some water but thats about it. My stomach hurts all the time. I use to smoke pot up until this break. But now when i have tried it makes the anxiety worse so I have basically completely stopped. I feel completely alone as I have no friends.  A few ppl that i talk to about my online business but nobody who I share any sort of personal details. I let people drift out of my life the last few years bc of my depression and feel if i tried to contact them i would be an asshole who only wants something and is a burden.My mom passed away about 2 years ago and really thats when the depression started. I never sought out much help besides from my SO. I put a lot of my emotional baggage on to her and that's probably when ou relationship really took a turn for the worst bc I became a different person. My Dad has always been emotionally distant so I can not talk to him bc when i have tried recently he turns the conversation to himself. I have 2 younger sisters that are significantly younger than me. I have talked to them bc they know something is wrong but i can not continue to dump on them. Three weeks ago I went to the Dr and got an SSRI and a benzo. The SSRI makes me feel worse so I have stopped taking it. The benzo provides some minor relief so I take it about once a day sometimes more. I have never taken any kind of medication as I have never been a fan of going to the Dr.Well this past weekend is when i discovered the most recent lying and had a break down. I could not keep it together. So i slept as much as possible and cried when I was awake. I decided to call a therapist Monday bc of my actions over the weekend and have my first appointment Saturday. Its a pretty big step for me even just making the call.Today I finally got my ex to talk a little after having no communication for the past few days and she said I am pushing her away due to my snooping and doesn't know what she considers us now. So my reaction to this is now to delete all of my social media. I took everything off my phone. I feel like shit tho and just want to reach out to her but i know she doesnt want that. I dont know what to do with myself. I hate being alone and just want her here. I hate my life but really dont want to do much to fix it. I cant barely get out of bed despite knowing I should. Part of me wishes I would just die to end this pain. I feel hopeless and alone. I am a mess. I am embarrassed. Everyone things my ex is the greatest and I think about what people will say when I tell them we are no longer together. I hate myself for still wanting her bc i know she has treated me poorly but i still love her.If you have read this far i appreciate you. Your a better person than me or anyone that i have in my life at moment. I hope this pain will subside and I can begin to slightly function again. But until then me, netflix and my bed is where I will continue to stay.","1"

So I crashed at her place to take a bus the next morning. There, we continued our talks and found out we have basically the same music taste, so we listened to all our favorite songs 'till 4:00 AM. Now, one night later and alone in bed I just realized that my majority of days is spent like this. Being alone, doing nothing and reminiscing the past... It sucks.","1"

"Earlier today I have this Academic Coaching session for my college, its was mandatory, my coach and I were planning out my goals in general like what are my short term goals...etc. Then we got to this question:  where do you see yourself in 10 years? I told her I dont know and she said so are you gonna die then? I laughed because I know she was joking but I honestly dont see myself in 10 years...I cant say yeah Im going to die in 10 years time...it will be a really awkward moment for both of us. I have so much to talk about but by the time I actually writing my mind went blank so...thank you for reading...I guess ","1"
"My CBT therapist suggested that I deal with rumination by distracting myself, eg by listening to music or watching comedy programmes. It seems to work, but it isn't a fix. So I feel that I have to avoid situations where I can't do that kind of distraction. Do you have any tips for a fix rather than a distraction?Thanks!","1"
"Hi, i'm 20years old, in this post i'm not asking for empathy or anything like that to be honest i'm just here because i need to express myself i guess.For me i'm sick since i'm 7years old (so for 13years, or 65% of my life), that means i only lived with this depression because before 7years old you don't really know that you don't even realize that you are part of the humanity...Anyway i think i'm sick since i'm 7yo because i remember understanding that the world is actually pretty ugly (for exemple the war, the crimes like rape etc...) and i actually remember that i tried to kill myself like puting a knife in my mouth and trying to force it in my skull (one day my father caught me but said nothing and even told me to not play with knifes) or even drowning myself in my bath. My parents got ""divorced at the age of 11, at the end of primary school, it didn't affected me or i don't remember affecting me. But i understood that i was really in a depression like at my 12-13years old when i was crying in my bed for some nights in a row because i thought that i was ugly, the world was disgusting and others ""stupid"" reasons. All this years i was scarifing myself on my left arms, no one noticed of course cause i was hding it with my clothes. It started escalated very quickly at the start of high school, this year i left Paris for Nice (south of France), where my only friend was kinda bullying me ... When i could i choose to come back to my mom house at paris and came to my primary/middle schoolOn the second year of high school i came back and told my best friend ""I'm coming back this holiday i want to meet everyone !"", by everyone i meant my closest friends and he litteraly told me ""You know, everyone hates you"", so i didn't go to paris this year and like ignored this but in fact it litteraly destroyed my mind, i cried a lot because of this, the fact that my best friend that i had since i was something like 4 told me kinda destroyed me. After this i trusted even less people and never got really close to them.On my last year of high school i got really depressed, people in my class clearly saw it when i got a bad mark at my first big test of physics and where i litteraly cried and scarified myself in class but no one told anything, even the teacher said nothing to my parents. For the first time of my life i remember expressing my sadness to my father like 2 months after the beginning of this year. He took the problem very seriously and sent me to a psychologist. This year i made a new ""best friend"" i was hanging with him all the time and teach me how to party etc... but we never talked about anything real like my depression 'cause i didn't wanted him to get involved in that. Even after i had a new ""best friend"" and was class was accepting me i was still sad. I, even between 2 meetings with my psychologist, scarified myself so hard that i bled a lot (still got a big scar), my father was completly lost but refused to go to the hospital (i don't know why) and took care of everything. At the end of the year, like i always done, i faked the fact that i was happy and my father thought that i was ""normal again"" and let me go to Paris (Orsay) to learn in the university Maths/Physics/Info.This first year at the university was actually pretty cool, i was at a residence where i make a lot of friends and even i integrated the association and i was co-responsible (i don't know if that is the word) of the internet. So the first semester was pretty rough but nothing unsual, i scarified myself but hide everything, i was at the 4th floor even thinking some days to jump and was hanging in front of the void like 1 times every weeks. But at the 2nd semester everything happened, one week i was so depressed that every night i started hanging at the edge of my windows, praying for someone to see me and call for help, the 3rd days i called the emergency number but they didn't respond and i was scared so i left the call, called several times but nothing. One day i called my father litteraly crying and with my arms in blood he called the firefighter and the police who came to my door and stopped me. At the hospital they asked a lot of questions, i don't really remember what, but they asked ""do you want to go to an specialized hospital"" and i said yes. The next day they sent me to this place, this was a place specialized in depression and with someting like 5 schizophrenic people (i knew one and he was actually really cool). It was actually pretty strange they gave me a lot of meds but i wasn't happy and the day they tried to move me to the ""new division"" to one of the ""older division"", when i was at the table with a lot more of people and they were like spying me and i had the feeling they were asking in their heads ""omg a kid of this age shouldn't be here"", ""he looks crazy"" etc... i overreacted, took a knife quietly and lock me in the bathroom and scarified myself, of course after half an hour locked they saw that i was missing and found me inside with a lot of blood on my arms. After 1 months they let me back in the residence and every months i had appointments at a specialized building called a ""CMP"" (Center medical and psychologic).So my years was kinda ruined but i decided with the meds and the helps i was ready to start a fresh new year and a new start without my depression and to be honest for the like 6 months i was just at my residence without having to go to the university i was ""happy"" of course i was depressed but less and i could live, no more suicidal ideas or not a lot.The first semester i tried to take lessons because i validated my semester so i couldn't repeat what i already learned but the university refused. The thing is when i started my second semester i saw that i havent work for something like 10 months so it was like super hard to work and i just ate me really fast. Even with stronger meds and stronger meds my depression came back really fast and i tried to suicide again. Of course when i saw that i couldn't contain it anymore i asked for help but nothing and the schema repeat like last year, a very rough week where i kept calling the emergency line and one day i called my sister and she called the police and firefighters. But this time i called them and asked before accepting the hospitalization and they clearly refused because for them the meds and the hospitalization were clearly useless and were not helping. So i came back with them a lived for 1 months with them before returning to my residence where my job was to find new studies.I left the residence this year in august, i stopped meds because i felt like they were doing nothing on me, i started taking studies of psychology in Nice but again the schema repeat 1 months ago, where i started not going to the university getting really depressed etc...To be honest i have no more hopes, i lived my whole life with this ""depression"" (i hear voices and have hallucination but the doctors said : it's a atypical depression), i'm convinced by one thing i want to die, i'm living a nightmare and i want to end it. I talked to my father about this and he said ""the only way to keep you alive is to hospitalized you because i don't want to lose you and i can't keep an eye on you every second"". I will see a psychiatrist in the incoming days my father will see if i need to be hospitalized. All my life i have done bad things and fucked up a lot of relationship with friends/girls and even my sexuality is strange .... because of a lot of reasons i can't even have a proper relationship with someone (i mean love relationship). Of course i didn't go in details of everything.I want to thank you for reading everything even if you don't comment and have a nice day.","1"

"I'm 34. I'm married to a beautiful, smart, talented successful woman who loves me and has a great family. I have three kids who adore me. I went to one of the top schools in the country and graduated with honors in academics and was a champion athlete even through my late 20s in endurance sports. I was a top performer and accomplished military officer, serving around the globe including in an elite unit in Iraq. I left that, founded a company on technology that I built and raised millions of dollars from supportive investors. I have been on TV, have celebrity advisors, been in numerous magazines and newspapers, sit on the academic board at a prestigious engineering university and asked to speak around the world on AI and technology.That said, I have no close friends cause they are all super busy leaders with no time to sit and listen to my whining.Everyday I think about killing myself pretty much all day. How I'm going to do it planning it, getting money ready for the family etc. All I want to do is sleep or surf the web. I see no reason to do any of it. I've tried every hobby and none of them are exciting or keep me interested. The only thing I feel like I enjoy is picking up women, but I can't do that anymore cause I'm married with a family. Even when I was doing that it was just temporary too and not satisfying, just one woman after another.I've been to therapists my whole life, and none of them have any answers. I came from a fucked up childhood, but not the worst I've seen from my peers. I don't have PTSD, but have anxiety and never been formally diagnosed with depression because I'm so good at masking it.I'm really at the end of my rope but when I see others posting, I think I'm super lucky and need to just suck it up. Everyone I talk to says the same crap, exercise go outside etc... But that doesn't help it just gives me an hour or two of distraction.How can I get help? Nobody wants to help cause I look like I'm doing fine and I can't explain why I feel like shit cause I have no good reason to.","1"
"I did it I finally did it I figured out how to perfectly be and how to perfectly fit. The answer of course is when everyone thought I was okay. When everyone liked me. 3 easy steps.The first is I just have to go back to pretending I looked pretty when I stuck with 1 meal a day if I have 2 none tmr easy peasy makes me still pretty to look at. The second is everyone liked me so much more when I was who they wanted me to be. My job will like me more who knows maybe it'll be easier to find friends anyone to like me really. Third is go back to repressing and cutting like my mom has told me if you look happy you'll be happy and if something bad happened a sentence spinning around in my head.... bleed it out, just bleed it out and it'll be okay. It'll work. It has to.","1"
"I guess I'm going to start writing now. I am at the base of a tower in which I plan to fall from in a few moments. I don't know what my purpose of writing this is. Maybe I think that writing this will serve to bring me happiness. Maybe I want to try to explain myself before I remove myself from this world. I am most likely ,however, writing for pity. I can tell myself that because I am not going to experience the desperate attempts to save my worthless life that I do not in fact want pity. I can tell myself that I truly just want to stop hurting people and that this is the best way. I can tell myself that I am a martyr for an unknown cause. That I'm a hero for sacrificing myself for other people's sake. But when it honestly comes down to it I don't know. I don't know if I can repair my wrong doings but I do know that I feel like I can't. I don't know if I am truly at fault for everything that I think I've done wrong but I know I feel like a failure. For all my success and accomplishments there are failures. And everyone goes through failure and that is a part of life. But my most recent failure has drained the last bit of hope out of me. I will tell myself that my next action will somehow prevent further failures and make people happy but i know that won't be true. I know that if I remove myself it will be my final selfish act. My final failure. Many things matter to me and I know that your failures don't define you. But I define myself by my most recent failure. All I wanted was to bring joy and happiness into people but at that I failed. I cannot make people happy and I feel destined to ruin the lives of others. I wish this was well written in the hopes that it could matter to someone but I don't have the time or the skill to make this decent. I have but a few minutes until my battery dies so this will just be my final thoughts which are scrambled and chaotic but anyways back to my previous point. I cannot make people happy I hope I have done so before but in the end I hurt more than I do good. The perfect example is what I plan to do next. This will hurt people. They will probably feel guilty even though everyone I know has been nothing but good to me. I cannot expect more from such amazing people as I continue to be such trash. But I have never known anything not what will be good or bad. I've always committed to a decision as that's the only way I know how to get through life. So I have committed to this. Once I start that climb I will have one way down and it will be destructive. I had a much better writing planned but it's too chaotic to remember or understand what is going on. I wish I could've been a better person. I wish that I didn't hurt people the way i have. I wish I could be the heroic good person I tell myself I want to be. I wish I cared enough to be good and commit to doing right. I wish that at times like these where I know I am being selfish and pitiful and worthless that I had the guts to stop myself. I wish that i could prove to the people I care about that I truly do appreciate everything they have done and that I am sorry for being who I am. I hate myself and what I do and have done. But I am broken.I can't feel anymore. I can't cryI can't loveI can't know anythingI wish I could tell everyone what is going on. I wish I could explain to everyone what my life is and what my decisions have been to lead up to this. I want to go out of this world being known as a hero or at least a good person but that isn't going to happen that isn't who I am. I am trash. I am worthless and selfish and I will now commit my final awful act. My final failure to hopefully end all others. I suppose I'll share this with someone but I don't know if I will be strong enough for this climb so I should leave now. I want to talk more. And I want to enjoy life but I guess this is it.","1"

"recently ive just been feeling so disconnected from physical reality. it feels like im drifting around on some other plane, loosely tethered to this physical thing that i can somehow control. honestly being able to move as a physical being has been kind of freaking me out as of late. it almost seems like my body is a third party that responds to my wishes, but isnt a part of me. sometimes it seems like it acts without my intention. like right now, im thinking about what the words are but im not even thinking about typing. this bodys just doing it. freaky.its also been freaking me out that people can see this physical manifestation. the fact that it represents me on the physical plane and that it can interact with the physical plane. i also hate that people can think about me. like, theres a me that exists in other peoples mind. it feels violating that things relating to me can happen outside of me without my consent.ive just been feeling so disconnected today and the past few days. i kind of wish i could totally disconnect from the physical plane and exist entirely on a different level. dont know what im hoping to achieve by writing this. hope you guys dont think im a total nut job. but even if you do, whats the point i dont give a fuck. none of this will have an effect on me.","1"
"Hello.I will try to be as precise and exact as I can be.F18Diagnosed with vegetative dystoniaMost possibly, my mental issues are genetically inheritedI feel not understood even if I just try to start a conversation. And I start with the smallest things, just to see if the person is on the same page, kind of. Guess what? I never finishI have a lot of pressure on me from my dad. He has some kind of a medical degree, has depression himself and has taught me that anti-depressants work, but you will never in your life will experience genuine, pure happiness anymore. So I'm scared. I'm scared to even open up to him about how bad it really is. I'm scared of judgement. Of him trying to press charges on my mom (because she doesn't try to help me) to get the child custody on my sister(parents are divorced, I am not considered a child anymore). Of him pressing me into healing naturally. Of him being not understanding.ALSO - he has actually told me the ""people have it worse, some are disabled, some are blind, be happy about what you have"" bsMy mom is openly calling me lazy, spineless and weak-willed. She doesn't believe in mental illnesses. She legitimately thinks that I'm faking it and I'm just lazy. Basically, she doesn't care about me. When I'm sick, most she'll do - open a window. That's all.I have no one to talk about this and feel understood afterwards.Have been to psychotherapist twice and I know that I had to go through a course(?) and it doesn't help immediately... but I still absolutelt hated it.My immune system is basically non-existent at this moment. I catch every virus I can, I get pinched nerves in my back every month or so. And that leads us to =>Because of being ill a lot, I miss out on a lot of things in school(last year rn). So I have a lot of things to do, many deadlines are coming up... But I have 0 motivation. I am fully aware of the consequences(dropping out), but I still have no energy fot that. And then it piles up and I'm stressed about not doing anything and it piles up again and so on. Never ending cycle!Because of finishing HS this year, I have to find an university etc. There's a long story about my search, but, long story short - I failed, my parents aren't doing any help but just reminding me and it stresses me out.IN CONCLUSIONI am stressing out about my stress. Too scared to seek help, scared of my mother saying ""stop acting as an idiot and just go and do (..) without thinking"" and not understanding me. Scared of my dad trying to tell me that ""you don't have it that bad."" Scared of being seen as weak and an attention seeker. Scared of being misunderstood. Scared of opening up. I cry myself to sleep, feeling things I cannot described. Being dragged, ripped up in two pieces by two different forces... idk. Feeling empty. Helpless. As a burden.Thanks for reading if you got this far... I feel a bit easier. P.S.: English isn't my native language, feel free to correct me.","1"
"I have battled depression on and off my whole life. This particular episode started in the summer of 2016. I've had ups and downs, feeling hopeful and then getting sucked right back into it.I take medication, I go to weekly therapy. I've tried setting up morning and evening rituals to help me feel productive. I've tried weekly exercise. I've reached out to hotlines numerous times. I've shared my thoughts with family and close friends. I feel as if I'm doing everything I possibly can to get better, but I feel like it's not worth fighting anymore. There are weeks when I feel like I've made some great progress and that things will get better. But for every week like that, I have a week like the one I'm currently having. I have intense feelings of hopelessness and despair. I slept like a cat today, I got almost 20 hours of sleep because I just want the days to go back to feeling okay. I used to think of self harm to cope with the thoughts of suicide but I don't see the point anymore. I jump straight to planning how to commit suicide. I desperately want it to get better, I don't want to commit suicide but days like this one just take everything from me. Edit: I am on my period and the week of my period my depression always skyrocket. It feels like all the depression I haven't felt throughout the month complies onto this one week. I know that it will feel a little better in a weeks time but it doesn't make riding out the storm any easier.","1"

"Seems I was just pulling out of last years ( I seriously need to refresh my memory on where the damn apostrophe goes lol) depression.  I totally miss enjoying Christmas.  The day after Thanksgiving I would drag out all my decorations and the kids would help me do up the house.  The day after Christmas I would go to Target or Walmart and buy more decorations that were 50-75% off for the following year.  It would take me 2 days to get the house decorated, and it looked awesome.  Id put on Christmas music and wed have hot chocolate... I still did it when my daughter went college, not far away, but was too busy to do it some years. Then my husband decided we were moving to SoCal and with no kids down there and him pretending to be Jewish I just lost interest. I missed my kids,  grown now, but would only put a tree up on the years they would come down. The other years I just cried.  Being down there kicked my ass in the depression area. I drank a lot and used to ask God all the time to just please take me. Instead He brought me back home to NorCal. But I remember looking forward to the holidays. Now Im back by my children but my depression has just gotten worse over the years (coincidently with each passing year Im with my husband), its just sad looking back at how happy I was and how I loved to decorate and buy gifts.","1"

"I understand this is more fitting for r/suicidewatch but from what Ive seen of that sub its a surprisingly cold place for somewhere where support is expected.I dont really know what Im posting this for but I guess I want to hear some people sympathize or something.I remember thinking a lot more logically than I wouldve expected, and for once I finally knew exactly where my belt was funnily enough. I walked into my restroom where the shower door has this sturdy metal rack thing I thought would be perfect. I managed to find instructions on the first page of results which I think is kind of ridiculous. I was surprised to find that cutting off blood flow to the carotid artery was a lot more efficient and painless than restricting oxygen flow. I tied a simple knot with the top of the belt and looped it through in such a way that when pressure was applied from the inside of the loop, it would tighten. My psychologist parents used to tell me all the time how smart they knew I was, and I was finally putting it to use. But apparently slight reserved ness is psychosis in the eyes of my mother, someone with a PhD in psychology. Gaslighting through and through. These were the things I thought about as I quietly stood with my head in the loop. I finally decided release my weight and fall but in the two hours I was standing there the knot had loosened, causing the belt to slip of the rack when I let loose.I cursed about it but lacked the motivation to actually re tie it.Jesus Christ in these past few days I feel like Ive been losing it. Forgetting where I was momentarily. Giving myself bloody noses and allowing it run down the sink. Schizophrenia runs in the family and all but Ive never read about it being anything like this.I guess this is just another one of those im so sad give me pity so I can feel cool stories.

"The entire story is a TL'DR even for me, so i'll just point out the main issues. Which may also be a little bit long.1. Unhappy since i was 10yrs old, when i finally moved to a elementary school(10-15yrs old) that over the years introduced me to the concepts of popularity, sex, bullying, figting/drinking/dating= makes your existance more valid. Im including my highschool years as well. 2. Growing up in my older brothers shadow(he's charming, ambitious, every1 loves him). And im the exact opposite. We are best friends, yet i hate and love him at the same time. We rarely spend time with eachother anymore. He lives in a foreign country for 5 years now.3. Never had a gf. I met a girl during my last year in HS(not the american kind of one, which means i was 19 yrs old). And she was the most amazing and beautiful person ive ever met and the only one i ever cared about/loved. Obviously i couldnt be her friend anymore, she had a bf, so i told her that i couldnt see her again due to those reasons. It left a huge scarr on my heart and it hasnt healed 1 bit for 3 years. No matter what life goals i work with. Always end up thinking about her. Nowadays she has a wonderful bf and a baby. Happy for her, but obv she don't care for me anymore which is understandable.4. Stabbed in the back by my so called friends on my 22nd birthday which made me stop looking for any kind of friendship. This was 1 year after i cut ties with the girl as stated above. I happily talked to her and invited her to my party and she gladly accepted it. Too much details but it ended up backfiring after my ex-friends ditched me which made me feel so fking upset that i just ignored everything. And we continued not talking to eachother EVER again.I have 3 best friends atm. And i rarely see them due to us living in different parts. No problems for me since we talk on the phone from time to time.5. Realizing that nothing matters, we are basically monkeys looking for attention and validation. Life is not as magical as i expected it to be. Emotions, anger, love. Nothing but chemicals in our brains. My entire life might be a simulation etc.I have goals. I have a nice apartment. Semi-well paying job, very physical tho. Car etc etc.I work out regularly, powerlifting and just recently picked up swimming. My so called depression-relapses happends from time to time and makes me wanna starve for 3-14 days which hinders my progress and sets me back drastically.My problems: I hate working, i hate people(including myself), i hate life(not only cuz of my own unhappiness, but also cuz of all the cruel fates life hands out to other living beings.)Nothing drives me to make me wanna work towards my goals. I dont really fken care for social acceptance anymore, friends, gfs is just a waste of my time.Yet, I just want to be alone in the darkness and sleep.Not looking for magical solutions or ""positive"" thinking- talk. I dont mind them either. Just wanted to write stuff down.Thanks for reading.","1"

I go through my days largely alone, even though from an objective standpoint people might assume that I'm doing fairly well in life.I'm attractive, in shape, intelligent. I do well in school (on track to graduate magna cum laude in a B.S major), I have a job that pays well, has great benefits, and allows me  to travel all over the world. I don't do drugs. I've only recently started drinking  a lot- but it's literally only to cope with terrible feelings of hopelessness and isolation. I just genuinely don't believe that life is worth living without having friends and people to share life with. I have everything else, but I have no one, and I want to kill myself because living in limbo is worse than hell. Does anyone ever feel that way? Is anyone else's depression largely caused by a lack of social relationships?","1"

"I can't accept love and kindness from people. Even from close friends and family members, I always feel like I'm resisting it. It's like I don't feel like it's real or genuine. Like they are just being nice or faking it. Even when it comes to my mom, who is the most genuine caring person I know, I don't feel like I can fully embrace her kindness. It's like I'm scared to accept her love, or to feel it. I always feel like I'm resisting when I hug her and when she shows she cares I'm super hesistant to let it in. I can feel myself tense up when anyone is about to say something kind to me or say that they care about me. Its wierd because if I look close enough I see that the motivation for a lot of the things I do is because I want people to like me and admire me. I want favorable attention. When it comes to a lot of things I have a big fear of ending up alone,  all by myself. But I'm not alone right now, I have good friends and family, yet I can't fully let them in. I can't take advantage of the social interaction they provide, and so I'm left longing for love and admiration. I'm always longing for recognition of certain good things I do and personality traits I have but when someone points it out or gives me a compliment I immediately tense up or I don't feel like it's really true; I just can't accept it. I think I'm like this because I always felt like my dad was fake. Anytime he showed affection it always felt unformatable or fake. The rest of my siblings feel this way too. Anyways, I ended up always feeling super anxious and tense around him and could never accept any love, affection, or compliments he showed, even to this day. Anyone else feel this way sometimes? Any advice or information would be helpful, thanks. ","1"
"My first ever real psych visit. I'm really hoping to find even the tiniest bit of relief. Wish me luck.Edit: just got home, I learned a lot about my self, man what a roller coaster, turned into 2 hours, some good self help info and therapy set up. Meds I just picked up for anxiety PTSD and depression should start working in a week or 2. Just getting it off my chest helped a little bit, even though it brought back some nasty childhood shit, it felt nice to just let it out in confidence.IF I CAN DO IT YOU CAN TOO. Go get help, even if the meds don't work, the tiniest sigh of relief at the end is a nice little boost that lasts a few hours.","1"
"For the first time in my life I spent Thanksgiving alone. It was hard for me to deal with but last night I realised I will probably be alone for many mmre holidays to come. With all the other things going on in my life recently it was almost enough to push me to the edge. The only defense I could make against killing myself is that I haven't given away all the Christmas presents I bought away yet. I guess even a stupid reason to live is a good reason to, but I don't know what I will look to hold on to moving forwards.","1"
"I switched from school to virtual school about 5 months ago and at first it was good but after a while I just couldn't will myself to do my work. I would do some but not what I was assigned. I had done it prior and they told me I could do it again if I did all of my work. I had been lying to my mom telling her I was doing good. Well now I'm trying to log in and I see that my account is disabled. I'm going to assume that tomorrow a phone call comes and I have to go back to school. The whole reason I'm in virtual school in the first place is because I have anxiety and depression. I should probably tell my mom tonight before she gets the phone call.","1"

"I struggle with anxiety and recently I've been beginning to feel worthless, hopeless and sad constantly. Sounds like depression to me. I don't know if I've felt happy since my dad died 10 years ago. My interest in things I love has depleted over the years and I'm feeling unmotivated and gross. Lately, I've been having trouble leaving the house. I just don't want to go anywhere, specifically to work. And it's affected my job performance, which is a sales job so that means I'm not meeting my goal this month and will be on probation in December which significantly decreases my income. I'm undiagnosed, but I'm seeing a therapist on Monday, and I'm scared that they'll tell me I'm faking it or inflating the issue. I'm afraid I'm doing this subconsciously to save my job. Or to find pity. Or I'm just the normal amount of stressed due to family and financial issues and I'm a huge wuss. ","1"

The next day brother was looking for cough drops at least that the excuse they used. And he looked in the box where I keep all of my SH tools in.  He then proceeded to go though my notebooks where he found some letters that were address to my family after I was dead but had never intended for anyone to read. I didnt even want them to read them even if I had killed myself. He freaked out and showed them to my sister, who showed my dad. They then decided to search my entire room they went though every box and they took all the cloths out of my closet. They took everything out of my desk. Read though all of my notebooks. This happen last Wednesday and they didnt tell me until Sunday. I saw my parents 3 Times between the time they found the notebooks and SH stuff. They said the his hospital told them to go though all of my stuff and they also told them not to tell me. I am really devastated that they read something so personal that I never wanted them to read. Now I dont know what to do. All Ive done since I found out is cry. I feel worse now then when I went into the hospital. Thanks for reading. I dont have anyone to talk to about this.

"What if all the depressed people today are just the misunderstood weirdos of the past? I mean the writers, the artists, the inventors and the innovators of the past. I don't think anyone here is a worthless little shit that can't think. I think we think too much, which ends up getting us in a shitload of trouble. I don't think it's bad though. It's just that in this age of conformity where everything is public, everybody knows everything it's so damn difficult to be weird. There's so much pressure to just be like everyone. So much pressure to do something, because everyone normal's doing it. So much pressure to like something, because everyone normal likes it. So much pressure to always feel ok, happy and smily and shit, because everyone normal does it. The closest thing you get to being weird and different is just normal people pretending to be unique and interesting. That's not really the essence of it though. The essence is that even if you look or seem normal, deep down you know that you never found anywhere that you actually felt like you belonged. Sometimes you feel like you never will...maybe the point is that some of us really won't find it. Some people just have to find the energy to make their own thing even if they have to carve it out of dried shit. Things won't get better unless you find a way to make them get better.Not saying we all have some magical purpose or maybe we do, but you never know if you haven't found it yet. Searching for a purpose can sometimes be a pretty good substitute for actually having one. It's ok to be alone. Personally I'd rather be alone or be friends with the weirdos.","1"

"So im 22 from south africa,I grew up in a very poor household, my dad being unemployed doing odd jobs, my mum working 12 hrs a day, I stayed in difficult circumstances however I had shelter and food which I am grateful for. Id never want to change my childhood as I learnt valuable lessons in life. In recent years things have changed, things have been good in all honest . I recently passed my post grad, my family and friends are ecstatic that I passed my exams as it was a challenging course, however this is a constant repetition of emotions for me, ive noticed no matter how much I excel in any aspect of my life, I feel nothing, I feel God should take me away cause I feel like nothing is worth living for. I know I sound ungrateful, I have family,friends, im an extrovert, I don't have much difficulty with finding dates/friends as im not shy, I have a bright future ahead but somehow im empty, I've went through depression mostly through my academic years which was difficult but I feel no matter what I cant shake it off. I dont know why its been this way, I just thought maybe id get some suggestions/opinions here. I just feel I will grow old continuously pretending to be this happy guy as a front who acts like he has his life in order, yet cry myself in the showers every day. Sorry for the long post :(","1"
"And when I say amaze, I mean it as it amazes me on how shitty it can get. Each year for the past 6 years have been utter hell. Talked about a lot, various health problems that I still have to this day, lost friends, depression, anxiety, family issues, house issues, lost fights and have been the talk of the town, loneliness, girlfriendless, guilt, self hatred, terrible luck, constantly wanting to die and using bad ways to escape, and now Im not graduating my senior year. I've always gotten the short end of the stick and majority of the people ik knows this. They tend to find my suffering humurous but dont know how ass it truly is. There's things Ive brought upon myself (adds to the self hatred part) and a lot of things have happened to me due to my terrible luck. I've been a lost soul for a while now and now I truly have no clue where to go in life. My state of mind has been completely fucked this entire year.  I've wanted to die for so long but I've never had the courage to end it. I've tried to eliminate my emotions time and time again just to fail miserably. This system is so fucked up that its ridiculous and no one wants to actually change it. I have no clue where to turn to at all. I've tried to go to school and try to do shit but I hate reality with a passion and just want to live in my dreams for the rest of my life. I also feel incredibly uncomfortable at school which is another reason why Im not there much. I truly don't know why I was born when all my life has been is failures, shitty situations, and brief moments of happiness with bullshit waiting for me. I truly hate myself with a passion. I hate the way I look, think, feel, and act. Im not even a bad guy. I try my hardest to respect people and they see it. Most people think Im chill and fw me. My parents definitely dont get it and they think that I enjoy not going to school lmao. They know Im depressed too and they don't even care. Theyre just focused on how Im not going to school. I truly despise my father and have for the longest. He's been so shitty all of my life. Constantly punishing me for miniscule things, hitting me for miniscule things, saying petty ass shit, buying food for himself when there wasnt much to eat, hypocritical, only wanting to spend time with my brother etc and then expects me to respect/bond with him? LOL, yeah ok.My mom always sides with him and thinks that Im ""rebelling"". The only thing I'd be rebelling is this shitty ass system that we're all fuckin stuck in. Of course Im seen as the oddball cuz Im not tryin to live this shitty ass life where I work a 9-5 and slave away for a rich fuck that doesn't give two shits about me and pays me dirt. I don't wanna live in a system with terrible foods and brainwashing entertainment. I don't wanna go to school where it's literally all lies and useless info to fill up space in my head and train me to be a fuckin slave like majority of the people in this country. I don't even know what to do with my life now. Its nothing but misery and failed expectations. I wrote a lot over the summer and wanted to drop some songs but I couldn't because there was no studio for me to go to. Had a friend that said he would let me record but ended up flaking. I have no motivation for anything and now the only places I see myself in are on the streets homeless, in jail, or dead. Why are people dealt such a shit hand in life? There's so many people out here that can't see the light. Why did God allow the world to get so fucked and then expect people to somehow believe in him. Ik he exists others may not but it just baffles me. Like why all of this? Why? Why? Why? I don't even know what Im saying at this point cuz Im just rambling/ranting here. This has been the worst year of my life. I thought it couldnt get any worse than 2016 but it did. Im extremely sorry for the long post but Im also extremely tired of the bullshit. ","1"

And I don't feel like I can talk to anyone about it because this is so stupid is not worthy.

"I don't know if this is just me. I want to call this lifeline so desperately, but anxiety and paranoia take over whenever I think about it. I'm always worried if someone overhears the call and goes overboard, sending me to every therapist in the area. On the other hand, there's the anxiety that makes me think that the operator will hate me or get bored with me. A texting (or online chat) version of the hotline would be so much easier to use. Does ANYONE else have this opinion? I have a feeling that so many other people need help as well, but are too scared to reach out for it.Edit: a few people in the comments gave numbers and names to organizations that actually do have a text line for suicidal prevention. I guess what's really needed is awareness. The fact that a lot of people are unaware of that option is a problem imo.","1"

It's been some of the happiest months of my life. I've sincerely tried working on myself, and I've had success, but it's incremental. However, I still get episodes of depression. I can't pinpoint why anymore, but some days I just feel mentally terrible. It's inexplicable. I'm where I wanted to be and I don't regret it, but I'm either really happy or fucking depressed. This compounds itself with not being able to find someone where feelings are mutual. Previously, this was just demoralizing, but now it's begun to add to my depression the more time goes by. I've tried many times and have had zero successes. I have my own life, and I have my own friends, but I can't find anyone to personally share some of my life with.

"Hi everyone, this is my first post. I've been having a very hard time lately managing my emotions and I don't even remember the last time I felt like myself, in fact I don't even remember what myself used to even feel like. For the first time in my life I feel very insecure and my old constant anxiety has returned, anxiety so bad I can't even sleep anymore which is now just feeding my overall depression. I get myself so worked up thinking about negative things as soon as I wake up I make myself miserable for the rest of the day.

"Hey everyone, first time post ever after doing a bit of lurking. I just needed to get this off my chest because its hard to talk about and its been here for a long, long time.Im not really sure what my major malfunction is, but I often seem to go through routine bouts of suicidal thoughts and feelings or existential dread every so often. Much of the time they come out of nowhere, but my overall consensus is that my life isnt worth living.  Ive felt it since I was a kid, well into my teen years, and now as an adult not much has really changed. My first serious contemplation was when I was 15, I placed my fathers pistol to my head and pulled the trigger being indifferent to whether it was loaded or not and also being indifferent to whether I lived or died. Skip forward a few years later and I enlist. I flunk out of the job I selected for myself and get placed in another job without any choice. Turns out it was super shitty and offered almost nothing of value upon leaving, which Im out now after just 4 years of complete fucking bullshit that I cant even fathom having survived in the first place. It left me with serious doubts in my abilities and self-confidence shattered to a point where the pieces are only glued together temporarily and all that exists is just a facade for others. I feel like I cant do anything right.I have a loving fianc now, weve been together for four years and hes sometimes felt suicidally depressed as well but he seems to be doing far better than me. I sometimes feel like pushing him away so that I have no one and I can just shoot myself. I have distanced myself from almost all my previous friends because I think theyre all mostly idiotic and immature, so I dont really want any new friends because I feel as though my fianc and family are good enough most the time. And speaking of my family, every time I try and reach out to my parents they give me the same bullshit about how life is always a struggle and that Ill be fine and that Im loved. It is just so unreal to me that everywhere I fucking turn no one takes me seriously, not for anything and not even my family.Im working some stupid security job right now where Ive been subjected to even more bullshit and some of the most unprofessional conduct Ive ever seen. But since the Army fucked me its all Im worth til I get my bullshit degree from the religious university I go to. All I feel is seething anger and hate and disdain for everyone and everything but it doesnt show on the surface, and the only thing I can think of is taking it out on myself because its the only thing Im good at. Ive never thought about physically harming others, just myself. Maybe Im just being dramatic or selfish, but I honestly feel so much pain, every day, but I choose to keep going without doing physical harm or using substances. I just play video games or practice the only hobby thats stuck with me for all these years, which is art, but even then I feel like abandoning my art because the escape to a new world in my games where I have anything I want or need whenever I want it. I dont know why I hate myself. Im not a bad looking dude, Im in pretty great shape, I have the few friends I want, I have a loving fianc, my family is always there (albeit with terrible fucking advice), I have a job, a home, a car, a bit of money, and a place to go if I lose it all. But Im just prepared to die, hoping that i dont wake up in the morning almost every day, but also not motivated at this second to just end it. There it is: the opportunity no one has ever afforded me to explain myself. I needed to vent and Im just looking for some advice or maybe someone to talk to about this, but I cant just keep bottling this up and I often feel I dont know what I want or need.","1"

"I've come to realize that my depression has become a fundamental part of my self-image, so much so that I can't imagine what it would be like to not be depressed. There have been times when I have felt something close to what I imagine most people feel like all the time, but this only occurs when I've been drinking. If I'm not sad, I just feel nothing. And isn't that just another kind of sadness?Lately people have been telling me to just ""Get over it"" or to figure my shit out. This has to be the laziest way of giving advice to people. People like to phrase it like, ""deal with your problem"" but it's complete nonsense. Think about it, the words don't refer to anything specific; there's no actions or process that it highlights that will fix anything, it's just a demand that you go from one state: unhappiness, to another ""fixed"" state of being. If being depressed is part of my being, and I'm supposed to ""fix"" that, what else can I do? Sadly, I come to suicidal thoughts thinking about this problem. The only way to fix me is to eliminate myself. Maybe that's extreme, but frankly, no one has provided a better answer to what it means to fix myself. What kind of things do you think of when you think of ""dealing with"" things, or ""Getting over"" something? Is it just like, forgetting? I don't know. ","1"
"I won't go too deep in to this, but small backstory: I have gone through a lot, just as many people. I have PTSD, OCD, Anxiety, and Depression.. My depression is bad. I don't have suicidal thoughts, but I live in my safety bubble. I eat the same things, I do the same things, DAILY, and I DONT get outside that way of life. It's my comfort zone. I've done this ever since I got my first full time job and was broken up with by my ex, who was my most serious relationship. I am numb, emotionless, and empty..I can't click with a single guy. Recently, this awesome man has come in to my life. He knows I don't have feelings for him, and he accepts that it wont happen any time soon because of how I am. but he is determined to stay in my life and not give up on me, because he want's to see me healed and truly happy. He is amazing. I want things to work out. But it's like that part of me that falls in love is just broken. Does this happen often with depression and anhedonia? I have my first therapist appointment for the middle of December. I hope getting help will help me.. I know this is going to be a long road ahead.. I'm not sure I'm willing to take it yet. But here goes nothing..","1"
"To be honest I don't remember much but details will be more available as I get closer to the present. The earliest thing I remember from sophomore year of high school was breaking up with my girlfriend at that time. I havent talked to her since then and looking back that was the stupidest decision for us to be dating. We rarely talked even when we were in person and it felt awkward. Oh well, Im moving forward now.Next up we have basketball season. This has been my favorite sport for so long, and that year I had been cut from the team. Lets be real here, I sucked. I have nothing against the coaches we have though, they are amazing guys that I still look up to. They told me I either had to be a better post player, or get a lot better at handling the ball. Getting cut still hurt though, and I wasnt sure if I wanted to keep playing.The rest of the year up until the spring was just a blur, but the spring was definitely the best part of the school year. Tennis was starting and it was only my second year playing, but I was so much better and it showed because I made it to districts. God, I love this team so much. Its all amazing people and I couldnt possibly ask for anyone else to play with.  School ended, I was feeling pretty good about life.Now its summer break and Im taking Math 95 to get into Math 111 for the next school year. It was a good class, good people, and good teacher. I still learned more than I had from Algebra 2 during the school year. Then I met this girl. Well I say met, but we had already met at a math competition the previous year. We started talking this summer though, and we clicked instantly. I thought she was the most amazing person ever (and I still do). I confessed that I was starting to catch feelings for her and she had said she was as well. That was absolutely amazing to me and when she said she didnt want to actually date until she knew me better, I figured that was perfectly okay. Then suddenly when school starts, shes distant. I didnt think much of it until suddenly she has a boyfriend and big surprise, hes not me. That hurt like hell. I felt like I was slapped in the face and stabbed in the heart at the same time. Two months later now, and Im still hurt. WE DIDNT EVEN FUCKING DATE.  We still talk and shes said she wants me to be happy but I cant see myself as happy without her as more than my friend. She said she knows the girl for me is out there and looking for me. The worst part is I know shes right. I know God has put someone on this earth for me and me for her. This all said and shes still the only person I can think about, and shes been in my dreams. Its all so confusing because I was praying to meet that person soon and I started talking to her. Now I pray and nothing happens. What if she is the one God put on this earth for me? If thats the case then why did she and her boyfriend start dating instead of me and her? I know its highly because Im only in high school, but what if? I dont know. All I can say lately if people ask me how I am is that Im tired. Im not lying to them I am, but they all assume Im tired from waking up early. Im not. Im tired from all the crap I have to see in life, and of being broken.EDIT: There's some stuff that happened recently that I can't bring myself to talk about, but it seems like her and her friends are leaving me behind now.","1"

"You've been so kind to me, love me unconditionally.We bonded through our depression and you accept mine without ever trying to force me to get better you're just there to be beside me during my pain to make it hurt less.I've grown so strong thanks to you. You deserve someone to hold your hand when your heart hurts. I've tried to be that person because you're dear to me and deserve that in a friend.You let me use you and go to you and I want you to use me too for whatever I'm worth as your friend.The long talks and the tears and the frustrated companionship I've loved all of it. We've passed boundaries we probably shouldn't have but you make me feel so...good. Do I make you feel that way too? Sometimes I wish I didn't.Because I can't leave my country and language and family for you. I can't go to you. I love you so much I cry to myself when you're away because I know I don't deserve you...but I keep you because I can't live without you. I want, need you to leave me first, I never want to hurt you, hurt me instead. Please. I'm sorry. I want you to be strong, I want to support you through your depression. I want to be your friend even if...You've been so kind to me, you tell me you love me because I taught you how to love, I love you. But not enough.

"My last session might be my last. I didn't make any new appointments while I was there and told her that I'd call to schedule another appointment. I don't know what I expected. It's okay. It's difficult for me to articulate what I feel in person. I feel like there's so much miscommunication. It feels like every time I visited her I was just sort of rambling along. I was supposed to see a different person but county stuff moves at the speed of bureaucracy. She apologized because it's taken so long for me to meet with some case manager person; I told her it's not her fault although I don't know for sure if it is. At any rate, I think that's it. I'm getting too old for this. I don't think I'm getting better.","1"

"Does it really matter? All of this.  I wake up everyday clamped to my bed by the intense ruminations of my disturbed mind.   2 hours later, I manage to drag myself out of bed, take my ""Truman show"" pills, take a shower, put on deodorant, lotion, maybe one or two sprays of cologne, get dressed, leave my apartment, then get in my car, Commuting to a cubicle for 8-9 hours then come home, watch my DVRs...no wait...I don't feel like watching TV...or doing anything....so I navigate through the internet with the purpose of killing the last few hours of the day.  Bedtime arrives, I lay in bed, #rumiNATION clocks back in, so I pop a ""STFU"" pill then arrive a the world that's completely different than that of my waking existence.  Not a damn thing make sense in this world, but that's ok.   I feel like I belong here...this so called ""dreamworld"".   Then my alarm clock goes off.   I'm back. Here.  In bed.  I don't remember what my dream was about, but all I know is I'd rather be there than where I am now.  I want to look forward to the days ahead, I want to be optimistic, ""happy"", grateful, but how can that be accomplished when everything around you and all that's about you thinks your a mistake.  That's not my reality, but that's how I feel.  That same feeling pushes people away, to where I am alone with my thoughts, my fears, my dread.   I started this off this week thinking I wouldn't make it out of 2017 alive.  The more I try to myself out of this ...""void"" its like the opposing force doubles down, then triples down.

"I don't really know that I intend to accomplish anything by posting this, maybe just some sort of outlet. I'm at the end of my rope and I'm not sure what to do about it.

The only thing I'm living for at this point is the few people who deeply care about me, because I know they'd be devastated if I was gone. I can't remember being ""happy"", not that I believe anyone exists in a state of constant happiness, but the last few months have been especially difficult. I graduated high school a couple of years ago and have been bouncing between jobs since trying to save enough money to get a place of my own and get established. My last job was hell, and I quit because I was genuinely feeling like I was losing my mind between working 40 hours a week and coming home everyday to the responsibilities of my chaotic home situation (which I don't want to go into detail about). I started to really feel like I couldn't bear to be awake for another moment for the first time in my life, and as a result I started to drink much more heavily, etc... Now a few months have gone by and I'm in a position again where I need to get a job to be able to support myself, and I'm absolutely dreading the idea of going back to spending 40+ hours a week doing something I hate just so I don't go homeless and hungry. I don't want to do anything ever again. I have a handful of close friends that I'm incredibly grateful to have, but for the most part I exist in almost total isolation. I apologize if I'm rambling, this is one of my first posts and I'm a little intoxicated, but I just can't imagine waking up everyday for the rest of my life, and I'm getting more and more frightened by the thought.

"I have had low grade depression since high school but tried to ignore it/ thought i just had social anxiety. It has since progressed and no matter what i do or change has taken over my life. My relationships are all surface level, except for a few, my family and best friend. I cannot concentrate on my schoolwork very well at all, i just want to lie down or go away somewhere in my head. I just cant enjoy anything I do. I feel so stuck. I know I should have told my mom sooner that I have this thing thats taken me over. The reason why i havent told my mom is because i have ALWAYS said that Im fine no matter what when she asks me. Ive been lying for years. And i dont want my family to worry at all. But its really getting bad. I dont have thoughts of wanting to die, i just want to quit everything i start. I want to just give up on my dreams and on making friends. I have started antidepressants, which i know my mom said to never ever take. I dont know if she will try to say no Im not depressed and invalidate my feelings because Ive always acted normal around her. Thats the last thing i need. And i do have moments of normality. But Im not happy with my life. I dont know how to tell anyone but my psychiatrist that i have depression. I just dont want the stigma, pity and worry. How can I tell my mom/family?Edit: Im away at college and family is at home.","1"
"This kind of comes from a lot of things. My country is going to vote on something unpopular soon that would hurt poorer people. This would also technically benefit me, which makes it extra uncomfortable. I feel I don't help enough on subs like this, though I am a college student studying a tougher subject, so I don't have a huge amount of time, but still... my area of study isn't like an EMT, nurse, or doctor. More sciencey. I don't currently give money to charity. Literally all I've done in the past year was give one guy a bit of money for a meal.I'm sorry this is so long.

"My SO does not understand, in the slightest, how depression (and anxiety) can effect someone. Especially the long term effects when left untreated. I've had depression and anxiety since I was about 13, so it's been 9 years, but it has gotten significantly worse the past 2 years during my current relationship.I try to get him to read about it but he refuses to, claiming he knows enough about depression and anxiety already. And he tells me that I cause all of our problems because I don't want to change. I have angry outburts and I try to explain the effects that depression has on me, emotionally, and he doesn't want to hear it. Apparently I can just change that about myself.The worst is that I have suicidal thoughts that become overwhelming at times. Most of the time I can cope but there are times when nothing consoles me and I cannot think of anything else besides hurting/killing myself. I've tried to go to him for help during these times and he tells me that I can get over it myself if I try.It hurts so much to hear that from the person I love. He's supposed to be my support but he makes me feel worse sometimes. There are days I want to break up with him because of this but other days, when I'm happy, our relationship is wonderful and I can't imagine being without him. Because despite the hurtful things he says out of ignorance, he has actually helped me with a few of my symptoms and thanks to him I have a normal sleeping schedule and I take much better care of my self.So I guess I'm here to ask you all how you deal with loved ones who simply don't and won't understand? How do you cope with the pain that comes with their denial of your illness and/or its severity?","1"
"Hi there, I'm 17 years old studying psychology and working a shitty job I just quit, last month. However this was all fun to me before, since three weeks nothing feels good anymore, I am numb, everything is a chore. Literally. It feels like I got 2000 lbs of weight and I want to sleep all day. It all started four weeks ago when I decided to quit smoking weed. Before I found weed I used to be depressed, always thinking about how shitty this world is, how shitty my future will be. Working my whole life away, I don't want people, society, expecting shit from me.. weed was a great anti depressant I guess. I was the happiest guy on the planet these years, now every single moment of happiness feels like faking it. I am going to smoke sunday when I hit the one month off target and I might get some improvements then, get better even I don't know if it's related, if this will stay.. I'm thinking of ending it like 6 times a day when I get alone, but I could never do that because of my familiy and friends. Do you guys think this is related to the weed, should I get back to smoking or sit this out with the risk of falling further and further into this shithole??? I really don't know what to do or where to go.. haven't showered in two weeks, tired all the time, people starting to distance themselves.. maaaaan why did I ever even get born, I can't remember asking for this, going to school, having to work, having to put up with all this bullshit, do any of you guys?Hope someone reads this and understands. Someone to talk to would be nice but I get if no one needs this sad shit on their fucking plate.. Thanks for reading byebye","1"

At first Im sorry because English is not my native langage and Ill be doing mistakes and plus it will be a total mess in this post because I dont know where to start and I have so much inside... Im a young women, have all to be happy, I just moved with my boyfriend, I have school during the day and then I come home and everything should be ok, I feel like Im so fucking selfish to think, even just a bit, Im depressed... But all my life Ive felt like Im watching an other persons life, like its not me, I feel so dead inside... sometimes I can laugh out loud and the minute after Ill be almost crying for no reason... I dont like thinking its a depression because I tell myself how can you be so selfish to think YOU have a depression? You dont even know what is it, a lot of people all around the world have a worst life and going through very hard stuff. But what I feel inside is... so dark... Im like a jar of water always almost full, and every water drop (?) can makes me cry like hell, like I could die of crying, feeling my heart and my head are shaking and completely broken...I told I have a boyfriend, its true, but he says that Im overreacting really too much, so I try to contain myself and it just gets worse and worse... when he sees me crying he ignores me, like if he doesnt look me in the eyes it doenst exist... As far as I remember, every day of my life Im asking myself and what if I die today? I could die when I drive my car, when I cross the street (sometimes I almost dont look when crossing because I dont matter about dying... but it scares me to do it, Im probably to weak..)Thank you if someone read this, thank you so much.

"I was born with an Imperforate Anus, which mean i don't have an anus when i was born. My parent sold their house to try to fix me. After 6 years on and off the hospital, i finally got a surgery to fix that but it come with its own problem, i can't really control my bowel. I grow up with that situation where i don't know when i'm going to take a dump. It may sound silly, but shitting your pants at a teenager and have them laughing at you is not a comfortable at the slightest. I tried my best at school but i never really excel, whenever i fail something people would told me that my family spent everything on me and i turn out like this, that i'm a burden to everyone. My closet friend move away when i was 12 and was left alone without any friends for a long time. That was when i started feeling depressed. I live with that depression my whole life, but i did a very good job hiding it, no one know i have it, because i always laughing and joking in class and at work. However, when the night come and i was alone with my thought, i always think of myself at a failure and i deserve to die, but i keep pushing on. I finally have a close group of friends, those that i can called my brothers, and thing was good, for a while.I had to move to the US with my family 3 years ago, leaving all my friends and my grandfather behind. In the US, i was alone, having no friend, my family scatter around, barely speaking the language and have to survive by myself, then the depression come back. There are many days that i want to end everything, but somehow i can still keep going. Everyday was as dark as the other, until the day i talked to her. She was my classmate in High school back in my country, we barely talk to each other on facebook, i used to like her back then but she already in a relationship so i didn't start anything then. One day i chatting her up on facebook, she told me about her divorce, how her husband treated her badly. I was there to talk to her, to share everything with her, and before i know it i fell in love with her, and she fell for me. We started a relationship, and those were the best days of my life. We can talk about everything, can joke about everything, we are just like best friend that love each other, everything was perfect. I waited for 6 months before i can comeback to my country to visit her and my friends. That 1 months with them i could never forget.After i got back to the US, i worked my ass off so i can build an actual future with her, and started to talk less because of my schedule. She told my that she was pregnant with my baby a month after i got back to the US, i was overjoy when heard that news. But bad thing keep happening to me, she had a miscarriage and lost our baby. We cried, a lot. Every night i dreamed of a kid who keep following me, i asked them who are they, and they told me ""Why can't i live with you and mom, why can't we be together?"". I cried my eyes out every single night. I tried to work harder so thing like that would never happen again, I thought that by doing it i can marry her and we can live together forever, but she thought that i was avoid her and no longer love her, but never tell me how she felt. There was that 1 extremely bad week when i was pressured by my school, my family, and my job, i barely sleep and had no energy to function. She also had a bad week and want to talk to me about it, however i was to tired to talk to her properly and i just half-assed talking to her. And that was the breaking point, she thought i no longer love her and her feeling for me started to go away. After that one week i began talking to her normally again, but she didn't seem like she want to talk. She said that she was sick and don't want to talk so i told her to remember to take her medicine, i dont want her to get sick, and i stopped calling her, yet still message her everyday. She never reply. One day I asked her and she told me that she no longer love me.The whole world crashing down on me. I begged, I cried, I explained to her everything, she wouldn't give me a chance. I was gonna ask her to marry me next summer, now everything is gone. I cried for the whole week, many time i was so close to commiting suicide but i held back because maybe i can still win her back. So I kept caring for her, talking to her although she never reply. I thought if I show her how much i really love her she will change her mind. Until one day i found out she already got a new lover before she broke up with me, and that crushed me. I asked her if she has anything going on with that person, and she agressively refused to answer. She told me that do i want to control her, that i always think what i want to think and never listen to her, she never did anything wrong, and she can answer it but she doesn't want to. My heart broke, i just want her to admit it herself so i know that she is still truthful with me, but she couldn't do it. I show her the proof and she change her tone, she said she couldn't lie to me so she couldn't said no. I felt like she has been lying to me for a long time. But i can't bring myself to be angry at her, i still love her so much. She came to me when i was in my darkest moments, she was the hope, the light that help me overcome everything. When she left, she took away all of that, now i'm alone with my own depression, when my mom saw me crying because of her, she told me to kill myself. I was closer to the edge than ever, i just want her back, i begged her and her new lover to let her comeback to me, that obviously failed. I talked to a lot of people, they all tell me that this will past, just try to forget her, everything will be fine .etc. I tried to go on with my normal life but she keep popping up in my head, her voice, her face, her smell, everything, and the depression hit. My kid comeback in my dream and asked me ""Why mom and dad fight? Why you are not together anymore?"". I tried to keep pushing on, I really did, but I can't imagine living a life without her. I can be working and studying 1 moment, and broke down the next moment because her memories came back in my head. I can't keep it going any longer and this time i think i will going through with it. All the pain and humiliation i suffered when i was young, the pain of being away from my friends, the pain of losing my kid, and the pain of losing my love, my hope is too much to bear any longer.","1"

"Back story: after graduating college I had a mental breakdown. I have been having a hard time the past 4-5 months with trying to find new depression meds and they all gave me terrible side effects. On top of this I got diagnosed with a chronic stomach disease that causes terrible nausea and leaves me unable to eat. I was unemployed for 4-5 months and just recently got a good paying job. The jobs turned out to be a shit show and I want to leave it. But I feel like no matter what I do or how hard I try there are always negative consequences. Just in general in my life. Right now Im working a job I was hardly trained for and Im neck deep in unfinished work, unanswered emails and data entry stuff no one ever trained me about. Essentially I dont know how to do my job, no one told me how and they(my bosses)cant answer my questions because they dont know either. Its like they expect magic or something.I left my key yesterday telling myself I wasnt going to go back to work. I then realized wow Im literally fucked if I stay and fucked if I quit. If I stay, Ill wake up everyday with terrible IBS, to the point where I wake up 1.5 hrs early to make sure I have enough toilet time . I cant sleep because of the anxiety. Not even with my sleeping meds. I want to leave the job but if I quit, Ill disappoint my parents and give the impression I cant take care of myself or keep a job. They already have been so sympathetic they text me everyday saying they are proud of me for working. Im so fucking miserable its unhealthy. If I quit I also will have no money- I have 1 months more rent in my bank account and thats it. If I leave I will spend all day feeling sick and feeling bad for myself. I will get extremely depressed and have suicidal thoughts. I know this because thats how it was for 4-5 months when I was unemployed. Being at work distracts me but its miserable.Essentially I cant win either way. Im staying at my shit job, doing the best I can and I know they wont fire me during the holiday season. If they want to they can. Itd be easier than having to quit. So I see no reason to leave other than just major emotional discomfort. I cry at work in the bathroom or in the back area everyday. I cant seem to separate my life from this job. Its full time so its demanding. Thinking about how Im literally going to be miserable either way makes me wonder why Im even living. Damned if I do damned if I dont. Ive been sick and unemployed for so long and if this job goes I think my parents will start thinking Im just an incapable human being. I feel like a burden, a loser, the less talented and smart and successful child. My sister is making 100k a year doing what she loves in NYC. Im in my small town with a chronic illness, major depression and essentially an eating disorder. Shit sucks. ","1"

"I used to always remember my appointment. But its been happening more and more that I miss them or mess them up. A few months ago I arrived at an appointment at 1:30pm when I was supposed to be there at 12:30 noon. Then just a few moments ago I tried to go see a specialist and my appointment was on Tuesday not Thursday. Its hard to get into see this specialist (takes months). I was supposed to see them for my hormone imbalance. Im trying really hard. The other day I had my final for school and at 6am the police came round my house waking me up. Apparently my schizophrenic Mother told them Im in danger (my mum kicked me out onto the street when I was 18). Then my mum keeps calling me saying my dad is murdering people and is going to kill me. She keeps telling me I met up with him, when Ive never even met the guy (I heard from other family members he wasnt a good guy, and was in prison before). So I go to school and work, so Im really busy. Then in my free time basically all I do is sleep, and watch tv shows.  Ive seen therapist but it just seems like so much effort to go there, make an appointment, then come home. I was supposed to go back to work after this specialist appointment. But I really just want to curl into a ball and cry. I feel sick and sad. ","1"

I don't think people really understand how those words can affect someone. The first thing they say is, ""Wow, you've lost so much weight! How?"" And every emotion I've fought so hard to keep down, comes right back up. It should feel like a compliment and someone please tell me if I'm being unreasonable? It feels like a punch in the gut every time. I don't know what I'll do if someone says this to me again.","1"
"I'm tired of being sad every day, crying every day, hating myself, all the negative thoughts that I can't stop from popping up. Anti-depressants don't work for me, they make it worse. Maybe if I could stop taking birth control but it helps my period. I smoke a lot of weed and take CBD butter with THC but maybe it's not enough butter. My depression is affecting my relationship and my boyfriend doesn't know how to deal with it. He told me I need to see a professional but I don't really feel like driving somewhere to sit for an hour and pay $15 and feel anxious the whole time. Do they help? I know I'm what's standing in my way but I just am not a strong person emotionally. I'm not strong enough to stand up to this and take control of my life. I'm also not strong physically with my health conditions (POTS, EDS, Gastroparesis). I'm just so tired all the time. And I'm not good at anything anymore. I hate who I've become, I'm a disappointment to my parents and to myself. Maybe if I had a better state of mind I'd be able to handle things better but it's a dark and anxious place.","1"

I am terrible at sports to the point where people make jokes flat out in my face like Yeah hes the best one on the team it just gets annoying.My family puts me down constantly, calling me useless, worthless and similar connotations. I am trying to get a job to prove them otherwise but no jobs even seem interested in me. I come from a family where all of my cousins (who I live with) are smart and then there is just me, I flat out feel remedial compared to them.Im ugly, anti social, pretty poor unless you compare me to a homeless man or something, kinda dumb, etc.Like if I were to give myself one positive it would be that Im nice but that seems to have gotten me nowhere in life or school, Im not even bullied Im just almost entirely ignored asides a few instances like the one I mentioned above about sports. I used to play video games constantly to try and relieve my depression for awhile but now Ive reached depression to the point where I dont feel too entertained by video games anymore. My teachers have little faith in me at all, Im taking 3 honors classes right now but I was never recommended, I just kinda forced myself in there and one even admitted to thinking I was not suited for it. I dont have a dad, my mom is constantly at work so I practically live with my aunt.

"Hey all,Thanks for reading this first of all. It might not be the best place to post for reasons to stay alive as I understand many of you struggle with the same problems as I do, but at least I think you understand my desire to end it all.Right now I have struggled with a very severe form of Crohns disease for the past 15 years, and the past 3 years no meds have been working so I have been switching from one to another and have had two near death experiences as a bonus. Right now I am on the last straw, if this med does not help I need major surgery and they will remove my colon. If that would solve it I would be ok with it, but Crohns can return after surgery. And then there are no meds for me, so that would mean more surgery. And at the rate of my illness now, I could expect at least two surgeries a year.I dont want this shit. I am 30. When I just had my involuntary near death experiences they motivated me to stay alive, but now I am just tired. I even regret fighting to stay alive. What life is this? I am on the toilet 30 times a day at worst, I have constant pain, I am autistic on top of this all so I dont have much of a social life either and basically all I do is survive. I feel like the only reason I keep on going because I dont want my mom to suffer and she would if I die. But I dont want to go through this hell either. There is absolutely no reason why things would get better at this point. They basically can only get worse. I feel like quitting my blood thinners (which is keeping the near death experiences at bay) and just letting an embolus kill me as that seems the easy way out compared to a life full of major surgeries, prednisone and loneliness. I just had enough. So is there anyone here who can tell me that I will think it is worth it at some point? Who has been through something similar? ","1"

"I'm hopeless. Trapped not because there's no way out, but because I am out. Nothing to challenge, nothing to solve, nothing to break free from, yet still trapped more than ever. I feel a strong urge to just burst, but nothing comes out. No longer caring about anything, i find myself caring about everything. It all crashes down on me, placing more pressure on me, yet it isn't the reason I'm trapped. I'm trapped by my self. So much to do yet there's no way I do it. It may get done by me, but I won't have done it. My autopilot is on, although I'm physically in this world, my mind is in a darker place. This disconnect between my mind and my body confuses and frustrates me, yet my anger towards myself masks itself in sadness and hopelessness. I don't care for myself anymore nor love myself. All I care about is those who love me, and that's enough for now. But will it always be? I have no desire to do anything, attend anything, eat anything, play anything. All I desire is for the weight to be lifted off my shoulders. This invisible weight that no one sees, making it 10x heavier. It's both my responsibility and my downfall. I'm expected to hide it yet solve it. Carrying it through daily activities as if I'm like everyone else, when on the inside I know I'm broken. I believe I might get fixed, but I don't even remember what being normal is like. I don't even remember the last time I was truly happy and not thinking of anything else. I try to be happy each morning, but it doesn't take long for the miserable gloom to kick in, covering all my thoughts like a cloud. My eyes are usually full of tears before I even realize my attempt to be happy has failed. It's a cycle of depression, with moments of feeling like it's fake, but hours of feeling it's pain.","1"

I don't even want to mention the fact that one time I would eat the entire fridge and other times I cannot put anything in my mouth for like 2 days. Most of the time I just find myself sleeping during the day just to... I don't know, hang around I guess. Sometimes I think of ending it all, I just feel like I have nothing to look forward to. Talking with other people has been hard as well. I remember as a kid I wanted to accomplish things, be happy etc. but now I feel... numb, I think. Nothing is any fun anymore.

"I don't get what's wrong with me. My whole life, I've always been on my own. At first, I didn't mind being lonely, but now it's eating me up. Recently, I've been more upset that I have never had a close circle of good friends. There are groups everywhere, and people don't see me as good enough to ever be considered one of them. Anything I've tried to be involved in, I'd be the person that was simply tolerated. Nobody would make any effort to know me or get me involved, I'd get pushed away at any attempt I'd make. I can't fit it, and I don't understand why.I'm really down because recently, I discovered that some of my online 'friends' made a group chat, and have kept me out of it. It's really hurt me, especially at a time where I'm hurting for friends. I wish people would just tell me what's wrong with me, or why everyone seems to avoid me. It's so frustrating, I don't know what I'm doing wrong, or why everyone treats me like this. It makes me feel like I'm less than human, and I just don't have any kind of worth to anyone.

A smarter person than me will come up with 10 ideas on the spot). I probably can't do anything creative for a similar reason as before. I have terrible hand-eye coordination. I have barely any social skills, so it's not like I have people in my life to abide my time with. Too afraid to start a business. Too afraid to travel (I hate airplanes). Never go out due to lack of friends. Get bored reading books since 1/2 seem to be too dumb for me and the other 1/2 difficult for me to understanding, so I give up.I'm pretty plain looking and not willing to have casual sex, so there's no way I can participate in the current ""hookup"" culture and find a mate.I'm also sincerely jealous of people who are religious. I can't bring myself to believe in God no matter how much I try. I also fail at being Buddhist or follow any path with diligence since I get back into my depressive modes and give up. I accept the fact that I'll always be depressed and selfish, and can't just use other's suffering as a way to boost myself up and not feel bad all the time. I just don't know what to do anymore. Can't afford a therapist at the moment since parents aren't doing too well financially. ","1"
"I'm usually a really funny, happy kid, but lately i haven't felt like me. In like the past 3 or 4 days i have been my normal self and then randomly in bursts between 1-4 hours i feel this dark cloud come over me. I feel this indescribable sadness and my mind races at times until i get a headache, other times I just feel down and i have no clue why. Whenever i try to be happy during these times i literally cant no matter how i try, my chest just feels like its sinking and i cant do anything about it. At times during these 1-4 hours i have lots of suicidal thoughts or thoughts of doing hardcore drugs to sooth myself or OD. Then whenI think about why I'm having these thoughts i literally cant find a reason why. I just want to sleep all the time too. As soon as the 1-4 hours ends I feel like a giant weight has just been lifted or some sort of being just left my body, but afterwards I'm still fucked up about what just happened. I don't really feel the need to tell others because they either wont understand, wont believe me, or take it as some sort of joke.

"Hello. I am an 18 year old male, just recently graduated high school and will be starting Community College in January. I live with my grandma and uncle due to my mother being a drug addict. My uncle had a girlfriend who lived with us but we eventually kicked out because she is an alcoholic. For some reason my family decided to let her come back into our family. Anyways, my grandma fell in the bathroom over the past weekend and got seriously injured. She is going to be at a rehab center for about 20 days. She hoards so the House is sort of a mess. My uncles girlfriend decided she wants me to spend the rest of my break before college doing nothing but cleaning the house. My family doesnt want to do Christmas this year, I cant even go out with friends cuz Im constantly cleaning the house every day now. When my grandma comes home someone has to help her walk around and do everything for her. Im the only person whos young and in good health in the home so of course It will have to be me, which Im happy to do, but thats going to take away so much time Ill need especially if Im in college. Long story short the rest of my break is gone, Im depressed, and I have no idea how on earth Im going to have time for college, helping my grandma, and having friends all at the same time. Im going to have to stay home and be ready to cater to her needs at any point. Like I said Im happy to do that because I love her but this is going to have a big impact on my life. Btw my family doesnt really care. Shes the priority and my problems matter little to nothing in their eyes. ","1"
"I never really progressed too far with my first therapist and I think that's because I was too proud and embarrassed to really open up about what was bothering me. I always found that the sessions I felt best about afterwards were the ones where I finally admitted something or mentioned a source of negativity in my life, but those didn't happen often because I would never admit the damn problem.  My life is actually going much better than it used to, but there are still a few things I want fixed. Any advice for what exactly I should do for therapy next time?

People always tell me to keep going and just get through it I know its supposed to be really good for me but why am I going when I'm not even like putting in the effort at school. Like clearly it hasn't been doing anything for me and they wonder why I look annoyed when they tell me ""you have to go to college its the best option"". I get so annoyed because I've heard that over a million times from teachers, family members, and other people. I often find myself stressing out about school and what I'm gonna do with my life. I get so mad that I begin to cry because I can't do anything else, I've thought of taking my own life several times because it seems so much more easier than doing what I am now which is nothing. But even than I still wouldn't be able to go through with it because at the same time as much as I want to take my own life I don't want to.

I'm still dealing with things that have hurt me deeply these past 8 years and I'm so tired I can't even think of the future. When I say I'm tired I mean I am so exhausted but still cannot sleep. I've been trying to get help but have been getting nowhere with therapy. Can't get a scheduling to check my thyroid until next week and hopefully I'll get my blood work done on Saturday. Just want something simple to fix, I don't want to keep guessing.","1"
"From people closing the door in my face after taking the wrong order, to restaurants taking 2 hours to reimburse me (restaurant delivery), I just cannot deal with people anymore. And what's with people having non-existent spatial awareness? Can you not see me to the point that I have to walk in the street just to pass people on the sidewalk? Or is it they don't care? I mean, my therapist is at a loss as to why I haven't made efforts to go to meetups, but I'm to the point of fully accepting being anti-social. I'll never be loved. I'll never be liked. And I'll never be appreciated. I'm not sure  what keeps me from doing a 1800 splash off a bridge. But for some reason, I gotta keep going. Maybe it'll get better. But I'm not getting any younger. I'll always be the case of untapped potential, it seems. ","1"

"Here I am at 23. I have good friends, good family, good job, etc. but am definitely not normal. I am not real with anyone in my life every aspect has a different face I put on. I dont talk to coworkers, classmates, or roommates. Any time attention is on me I blush. Never had a girlfriend, despite kinda trying for a few months (meeting up and just hooking up with ppl via tinder/bars even so I have a lot of difficulty doing this due to not knowing how) but just dont really have the desire its just me trying to be normal. Been dealing with terrible social anxiety and depression my whole life. Lately been doing a lot of introspection trying to figure out where this stemmed from besides a family history of mental health. I have ended up pinpointed one aspect of my life that unknowingly has had a important affect...being forced to sit alone at an allergy table throughout elementary school. This along with all the other side effects of having a deadly food allergy in a world where it was a new concept probably created a me vs them mentally and hindered social behavior. Sometimes I think I may have aspergers/austim cause of my inability to get over social issues and connect with most people","1"

"I don't know what to do. This is literally ruining my relationship. I've been with my current boyfriend for over 3 years now, and we even talk about getting married, but my depression is ruining everything. I don't have many friends, and I don't want to put more stress on my boyfriend. I don't have anyone I can talk to about this. On days I don't work or have school I try to hard to do things around the house to help out, but I barely have the energy to take the trash out. Getting out of bed is so hard to do every day. I don't remember the last time I felt happy to wake up and just feel alive. I feel like I'm just pushing him to his limit, until he finally snaps and breaks up with me.  He's been so understanding of me for so long, and it's just getting harder for him to deal with this. Today he got mad at me because I didn't finish cleaning the room. And I get it. We've had talks about this before and I promised him I would try harder.It's hard for him to understand that it's a struggle for me to get out of bed, and that I'm not just completely lazy.  I don't know what I'm doing to do when he realizes that I'm not worth all of this added stress on him. I don't know how to fix myself.","1"
"Last night durning a therapy session I made the stupid mistake of talking about my kinda poor relationship with food.Basically i'm underweight guy ( by about 14 pounds maybe more) & this sometimes gets to me cos a 36 year old 6ft guy really shouldn't weigh 140 poundsAnyway long story short every time i tell myself to eat more I always fear that i'll just wont stop and become overweight and I stupidly told my therapist that if that happened then I would destroy myself but I dunno where this fear of having a few extra pounds came from she already knows that i deprive myself food as a form of self harm , but i never told her of the guilt i feel if I ever give in and eat a big meal and that the following day no matter how hungry I feel I'd make sure to eat less than the usual small amount to make up for itEG: had a KFC the other day , so the next day i skipped breakfast , had a really small lunch and dinner and felt pretty hungry going to bed I regretted the instant i started to talk about it cos to be honest i cant explain why I feel like this ","1"
"Hi there. I'm here to ask for help. I have a close friend and colleague who acknowledges he has depression, but is not taking medication or seeing a therapist. He's been in a very forgiving space with his job for the last ten years, but is now on the edge of getting fired. He is very loved by his colleagues, but is alienating everyone. I think his marriage is okay, but his wife places a lot of pressure on him that doesn't seem to help. In essence, the problem is that he oscillates between blaming his depression for his problems and blaming everyone around him. To given an example: he'll say that the reason he can't get something finished (or started) is because he hasn't been given sufficient direction or support at one point, but when that doesn't suffice or whatever roadblock he's point to is removed, he'll say it's because of his depression. I'm really concerned that he's getting to the point of no return. His bosses have  essentially told him to get his act together or find another job. I think this starts with him genuinely getting help for his depression - whatever that help might be - but I get the sense that he would rather attribute his state on external factors than do the hard work of dealing with himself. What can I do? Any help would be really, really appreciated. ","1"

"Been on a good come up lately, lots of money. Just bought my first car too, but none of the money I spend makes me happy. If anything, it makes me feel worse. My job lead me down a weird path in life, functioning cocaine addict and all. Literally can't get out of bed without a line, and if I don't have it I'll have a panic attack. My fiancee left me recently, and since then I've just become more successful. But that doesn't even make me happy any more. Ever since I've been making good money, I feel like people I've known for 10+ years are starting to hate me, and it's not the drugs because nobody knows about that. People I used to see every day suddenly don't have the time any more, even tho they have the same schedule as before. I've gotten other friends on the same level as me but they're not good people. I'm not a religious person really, but if there is a hell I'm sure I'm going there. I donate a lot to charity to try and make up for it, or maybe just to make myself feel better, but the good feelings I get from it only last a few minutes. I've never really been depressed in my life before but I think that's what I'm falling into. It's hard for me to get motivated for things these days, and I just feel a constant ball in my throat like I'm going to be sick. I used to be a great person, everybody's friend, but it's hard just to put on a smile now. I used to go out with my friends every day, drinks, dinner, movies, etc. But I work from home now so the only time I leave is to buy groceries and run errands. Shit, I can't even force myself to clean my house, I hired a maid just to do that. I don't like who I've become, but at the end of the day I gotta pay my bills. It's weird because I grew up really poor, always wanted to be rich, but now I'd give all of my money just to be happy. Sounds kind of like a movie, or a sad song haha. Anyway that's my rant, maybe someone out there who's gone through the same thing can offer a piece of advice. ","1"

"So I attempted suicide last spring by ingesting antifreeze. Life was very tough no money etc. Since then I picked myself up and I can now manage my money better and I dont fight with my wife any more.I am more calm but there is still one issue that I am kind of embarrassed to deal with...A year before my attempt I found the office job of my dreams where I have no pressure or stress as long as I finish my work by the end of the day which only takes me 2hours. My office is inside the warehouse so the warehouse coworkers come and ask me questions when I release their work if there is something wrong usually with inventory.Everyone is nice except for the second shift team leader. That guy in the beginning seemed nice but as time went by and he found out I was an introvert he became more intrusive asking me personal questions and complain about my mistakes in front of the supervisor or manager. This along with other personal problems at home is what drove me to attempt suicide.Now I think the guy has personality problems he is in his late 20's and makes fun of the older people by calling them old to their face. I think that because im younger he does not like me also he got married because he got his wife pregnant at 17 and I got married a year before my son was born and also I moved in with my wife right into an apartment. In the other hand he had to live with his parents until he was stable.Anyways im a nice guy to everyone no matter what they look like I treat everyone how I would treat myself. The team leader last year told me that he used to be a bully in high school and later he started giving me wet willies and pat my back hard when he would greet me. And often he would say ""one day you are going to stand up to me and cuss me out""  After a while he stopped acting like that but he still kept putting me on the spot in front of my supervisors and manager whenever I did the smallest mistakes in my paperwork. This caused me to not get a raise this year because he is trusted by th manager and they both go fishing often also he is the only good worker that we have in the warehouse everyone else makes mistakes too often.Earlier today he brought me a piece of paper that needed a detailed note and he told me -Fix it!I said -this is already fixed.Then he got mad and told me-fuck did you just say? I told you to fix it!I stayed quiet and my supervisor fixed it for meHow can I stop him treating me like crap? Im stressed out right now and my anxiety is not helping me focus at work. I hope this text doesnt have too many errors but I cant focus at the moment.","1"

"Created a reddit account for the first time ever today because I need to a place to just air this shit out:I find myself frequently having thoughts of different ways I could commit suicide and how easy it would be to do it. At the same time I recognize how selfish suicide is and I DO NOT want to do it. I know when I'm down the mantra is that ""this will pass"" but that doesn't mean it doesn't suck. And I know that killing myself doesn't solve any problems, it just eliminates me from the solutions -- my kid still needs a father, etc.I guess that's really the sum of it - I've gone really dark but I know I need to find a way back out because people are counting on me and I can't be who they need to be if I'm gone.","1"

"I won't be suprised if nobody reads it, I'm used to people giving shit about me, but i think that a little bit of foolish hope has brought me here...I always was an pesimist, i always though that if i assume the worst-case scenario, I'll be prepared and ready to deal with everything, i was wrong, I was terribly wrong. I live in Poland, and i just turned 18. I had good, but hard childhood, everyone liked me, my family wasn't poor, and still i can have almost everything i can ask about. But i had horrible problems primary school, and my parents forced me to learn for 4 or 5 hours each day, when other children were playing and hanging out with each other, i always hated it, and in result i hate and refuse to study something I'm forced to until today. But still my times in primary school and middle school were good when everyone liked me, i even almost found love and almost got a girlfriend there (which i would rather not find for my own sake). But everything started to fuck up in high school. Me and my friend from middle school in which i fell in love (and she propably fell in me) got an serious argument and lost contact, i have broken my knee and went through surgery which effectively immobilised me for half a year and made fat, the one guy that followed me from primary school destroyed my reputation and convinced everyone into hating me and making fun of, because of that i had to change school (and serious maths problems) and for fucks sake from all of people i had to hit into a class full of good friend of my previous one, so my torment of being made fun of is continued which effectively made me aggresive, closed and paranoid. In second year i though that everything will start to become better, me and my friend reunited, she propably was still in love with me because she said she missed me, at least some thing were going quite good, but not for long...after a few weeks she told me that our old friend is propably in love with her, and some time later he gave up and stopped texting her, and then she snapped (propably same as me, she has never been in a relationship, and she realised that she lost another guy) so for a whole month i was basically her therapist and only support, i wanted to tell her that i still love her, but i couldn't. After a month our friend organised his 18th birthday party, me and she got drunk, she wanted me to get drunk that other guy who loved her and ask him ""what the fuck does he want"", and i did, he told he gave up, and he doesn't care anymore, when i told her about that, she started crying, her other friend went to talk with this guy, and i talked with them, and because i was drunk, i was stupid enough to push them both outside and talk, and now they're in almost year long relationship. I don't know why, their relationship is driving me mad, even if i know i will be able to get another woman, if one will show up (which doesn't) but knowing that i fucked up everything, that i lost a very beautiful and intelligent woman, drives me mad and into thinking that I will never find anyone, we barely talk anymore because her boyfriend has priority and she has a lot of studying, and it drives me mad. I'm in a 3rd year of high school now, and it's terrible, everyone turned away from me, i have serious problem with my marks, no motivation to study, and my parents gave me a lot extra lessons, and in result i barely have time to do something for myself, i feel like a broken slave, i want to die, and i don't know what to do to stop feeling that constant pain, frustration and shitty feeling. I tried professional help, and it hadn't worked, parents and few friend left tells me that my university time will be better, but I'm afraid it never will be better","1"

"Warning: Extremely longI play a game called FFXIV and I also follow the reddit. Yesterday someone shared a story about hoe the game saved their life and I posted a little about my story. I was afraid to share everything since it wasn't an appropriate thread so I got directed to this thread and I hope it's okay if I post my story here...I graduated high school back in 2014, I went right into college thinking that was the correct path. At the time I had a boyfriend who went to a different college 3 hours away from me. He was my longest relationship of 3 months, the other 2 only lasted 2 weeks. While I was happy at first, I slowly began to hate it...He never called me beautiful or said he loved me even though he would call other girls beautiful in front of me and I would tell him I loved him. I have no self esteem and I just wanted him to once think I was something. So once I get into school he visits me and dumps me. I was torn down, for a very trivial reason, but it hurt me a lot. I began to party, I would drink a lot and sleep around to try and make myself feel better but it didn't work. I started sneaking alcohol in my room and crying until 4 in the morning, writhing from the emotional pain, wishing I would just die already.I started getting noise complaints and had to see therapists when they found out the noise was me crying every night. I hope I don't offend anyone who may be a therapist...but THIS therapist was horrible. Like I said I play video games and I tell them that is how I cope with my emotional turmoils. They told me that it was not healthy and even though I'm an introvert I have to become an extrovert. When I explained I don't like big group settings they insisted I do it anyways. Needless to say I stopped seeing them.Christmas break is almost here and I need to sign up for the next semester classes. I don't remember what the building was on campus but they handled some form of paperwork. While I'm waiting a lady asks if I am okay. You ever have those moments where it's fine up until someone asks if you're okay? That was that moment. I broke down and she took me to a room and let me vent. I told her everything and she listened and she was more of a therapist than the other person. She asked me what I wanted to do and I told her I can't be here right now, I'm not ready for any of this. Soon after I went back home and started working.I started out at fast food then became a waitress then finally retail. October 2016 I was still at that retail job when all hell broke loose and my life has been fucked ever since.I have a sister who is a few years older than myself. Married, 2 kids age 5 and 2 now, y'know. Well things break down with their marriage and she suddenly moves in with my parents and I, kids included. At first I hurt because even though my sister mentally abuses my mom and I, I guess I still love her. I was angry remembering her happy wedding and seeing her cry so much I wanted her to be happy again.So at first our family does what a family should, we help her. Slowly we rebuild her, she gets a job, and things are looking up. Except she doesn't help us buy food for her and her kids, we buy her diapers, provide clothing, pay lawyer fees, etc. That's okay to start off with but she does not pay us back at all and she abuses it too. She wastes her money on a PS4 since I wouldn't let her use mine, goes to concerts, buys jewelry, you get the point.After awhile I get to this point where I begin to experience what I think are panic attacks, or something similar. One day I get fed up with my sister always being loud and letting her kids do whatever they want and I go downstairs to my parents and I started crying before I essentially black out? Next thing I know I'm looking up at the ceiling and my mom is stroking my head. My jaw felt numb or like it wasn't even there, my head feels cold and tingly and my body is tensed up. I was scared. I think about hoping I could die so I don't have to deal with these issues anymore but I'm also afraid of dying.I had work that day and if that really was a panic attack I had earlier I can only describe this next part as continually going through a mini panic attack while at work. My jaw would randomly go numb, I would slur my words and my hands kept shaking. I eventually went to talk to my manager about this and they did not care whatsoever. They told me I'm at work that's all I have to focus on or I can just leave and find somewhere else to work. Thankfully I leave a few months later.Now it's May 2016 and I got a new job. This is the best place to work, sit down and make calls, fun events, the managers care so much about my mental wellbeing that I got referred to a program just for working there that I can use for free. But of course things back home still suck. I eventually get fed up with my sister living their with her kids and I start yo close myself in because I feel heartless. Now my thoughts are, ""She can afford to live in an apartment with her kids, she makes so much more money than I do and she can get assistance."" ""I hate how the kids scream and run inside they house. Not to mention they kick and bite drawing blood and leaving bruises."" ""I don't care about my sister or her kids, I only care about my parents and myself.""This starts to eat away at me. These are my true feelings and I am so fucking disgusted I would think thoughts like those. But I am fed up with how my sister always abuses us and has bullied me growing up. I could care less, I want her to leave my family alone, if not my parents could fucking die from this. They suffer from PTSD due to military service, mom has fibro, memory issues, she is constantly in physical pain. On the other hand my dad has schizophrenic-like episodes, anger issues, and experiences petit mal seizures under extreme stress. All I want is for my life to be normal again. I was depressed to begin with and I can't tell you how many times I've wished I had no emotions during this whole divorce shit show.My sister continues to abuse us same as always and it gets to a point where I tag along with my mom to her therapists one morning. I tell her all these things and my mom loses it. I tell my mom she needs to find a place to live and that finally pushed my mom to give my sister a moving out day. Things are good for maybe a week, but only because the piece of shit biological father had them that whole week. When they come back my parents are the free babysitters.I love my niece and nephew but I hate kids. I never want them myself. Never. I can't stand how they're always screaming, crying, hitting, kicking, biting, banging on my door trying to invade my room. I feel like such a piece of shit it isn't their fault but they make my angry so I don't try to interact with them too often.I eventually reach my 2nd week of work at my new job before I realize I'm suddenly in pain. A lot of pain. Thinking it may be my IBS I just do some stretches and take a painkiller but it won't go away. Leave work early only for the ER to say I have appendicitis and need surgery the next day, putting me out of work for a week. Thankfully my job understands and the managers all sign me a get well soon card, which was super sweet. But my sister does not understand.I couldn't do a single thing on my own while on bed rest. Bathroom? I need to be carried. Hungry? Someone has to make it for me. I would constantly fall asleep due to the medication they gave me and I needed to push a lot of water so I was under constant supervision. Since this was the case my parents told my sister to try to get a babysitter that week and man oh man what a shit storm that was. My sister looked at me and said I was faking it and I didn't have surgery, she said that I should just watch her kids for this week since I won't be at work. So what happens next? My mom can't handle the pressure and we have to call 911 after she suffers what we call one of her ""spells."" She becomes unresponsive, she drools, she doesn't know who she is or where she is, doctors also think she suffers from stress induced seizures too. I end up having to go across the street to my neighbors (my dad HAD to go with my mom there was no way she could be alone), both military personnel who were more than happy to help much to my embarrassment.Now it's basically December 2017 and my sister is still abusing us, she skipped work a lot and acted sick so we would take care of her kids, she isn't paying any of her bills, she doesn't feed or bathe her kids just like their father, we still pay her lawyer, she has neglected the children a lot lately so we basically feed them, bathe them, watch them 8 hours a day Mon-Fri while she is ""at work"" and I'm going to work, going home, and wanting to just fucking end it all.I struggle to use video games as an escape now. This may sound very pointless and stupid but when I play a game if I don't do a pattern correctly I can't play it anymore. To give an example, with the FFXIV game I play, when I level up I had to do A > B > C and go back to D. If I mess up the order once, my chest begins to feel tight and I can't do it anymore. If I have a quest that says, ""Kill 20 mobs"" and I kill 21, it bothers me and I can't enjoy it anymore so I either quit or just force myself to play and not even enjoy it. I have never had this weird ""pattern"" issue before now and it's ruining the only thing I have left in my life.I don't know what to do anymore, I don't want emotions, I'm afraid to kill myself and I'm afraid of dying but I simultaneously want something to happen that I have no say in. I hate how heartless I've become, I should be wanting my sister and her kids to have a normal life but I don't care I want my family and I to have a normal life.I'm so sorry for the long post, I'm afraid to talk to people in real life about my issues and venting all of this has to be done or else I'll just suddenly explode one day and break down...","1"

"This is the beginning of the end. My mind is split on everything, like two or three people beside my self live in my head. I imagine them as two beings resting on my back whispering in my ear. My mind does not stop worrying about everything. I think about offing myself constantly. When I cut I feel euphoric for 1-3 days. I want to run away from my life. I think of killing others too. I woke up at 5 in the morning and started insulting myself. Im just tired of my mind not working. Sometimes I almost cry wanting to have a girl to hug; not in a  poor me I have no gf boo-hoo sort of way, I just want to have someone to hold, someone with a beating heart to feel.

"In the real world if you open up about your problems to others they tend to either change how they behave around you and distance them selves or tell you to go elsewhere to get help. Online we're forced to only talk about it in subs like these. That leads to people with emotional issues to be ""quarantined"" and only be around each other. While there's nothing wrong with everybody here sharing their problems and relating, if somebody wants advice it's hard to get new ideas from others who are still struggling themselves. I believe that isolating us only makes things worse. As far as therapy in the real world, It's just somebody's job. You can't tell if they really care to help you or are just going through the motions because that's their paycheck. I understand that only we can fix our own problems but it's almost impossible with zero outside help. ","1"

"Basically says it in the title, I'm just looking for some insights/support from anyone else who has experienced this. I recently, like within the last 2 weeks, have curtailed my alcohol abuse dramatically. From 8-12 drinks per night every night to 2-3 since last Sunday. Only had 1 beer last night. I knew that it was going to hurt mentally in terms of increased anxiety and depressed thoughts/feelings, but yesterday and today have been really bad. I feel like I could cry at any moment, everyone thinks I suck, I'm not worthy of happiness, etc.  I know this is typical. I've been through it before when I've tried this and have always gone back to abusing the drinks. I really want to make this attempt stick and I feel like in my head, I have more strength and motivation this time than ever before. I'm done with feeling shitty all the time, I want to reclaim my happy life! Can anyone relate? How did you stick to your guns and get through it? Any and all responded are appreciated. ","1"
"After months of being on this medication that has completely taken every ounce of hope from my body, taken all energy and turned it into negative, my body drove me to attempt at my own life today. In the face of the end, which I saw face to face, I felt nothing. I just thought, oh. The attempt ended unsuccessfully. After pleading to my doctor to take me off this combination that has increased my ideation of death and drove me to (now) attempt, I have had to come to the conclusion my doctor does not want to assist, I have to get myself off the medication. My doctor gave up on me already, so Im giving up on her. I have no access to any other doctor and dont want to see her, as shes become annoyed with my lack of success with repeated antidepressant trials. I cant help how my body reacts. I feel so low and cannot feel anything. Heres to hoping life is better on the other side. ","1"
"I had a panic attack during a marching band audition, causing me to completely blank on the memorized piece. I explained what happened to leadership, but they told me they didn't care, and gave me an alternate spot. I've been an alternate every year I've been in this band, save for about 2 weeks last year. Strangely, the leadership has never given me an explanation as to why I've been an alternate for this long. It's usually a 1 year max, but this is my 2nd year. It's also my last year getting to play in the marching band. I've tried talking to them about it, but they won't even look at me while we're talking, and act like they're walking on egg shells. I went to the directors, but they waited too long to make a decision, and we'd already learned half the show. It ended up triggering a 3 day depressive episode and several panic attacks. And I missed turning in 4 big assignments that week. It's been about a month since then, and I still get upset about it, crying before nearly every practice and performance, 6 days per week. They gave 2 new members spots over me, 1 of them can't even play the pieces we perform at every game, including the school fight song, and is one of the worst marchers in the section. Before we auditioned, leadership was complimenting me on my marching and music, but here we are.","1"

"There's so much on my mind, but every thought leads to suicide. I want help, but I'm too apathetic to explain my mess of a life and mind again. It doesn't lead to anything, and my nihilistic perspective means it doesn't matter anyway. I'm going to die one day, it might as well be soon. I can no longer think of any reason to stay and I feel... calm. It feels like instead of depression driving my suicidal tendencies as it used to, it's acceptance. i can't gather the will to fight against it anymore. i just want to tidy myself up a bit and write a few christmas cards. I'm just holding myself back day to day, solemnly wondering if I'd change my mind but it doesn't feel like it. I've lost track of time but I think I've been like this for? a few weeks? between 2-5 weeks. Maybe I'm just a little bit afraid of the pain. But I'm really looking forward to not existing. I'm so exhausted. I'm so damn exhausted of living. It feels pretty much the right time to die now. ""but you have so much to live for!"" - but I feel like I've lived through enough. I'm happy with what I've experienced. I don't need anymore, especially with how everything is tainted. ""it will hurt the people around you"" - people are hurt by all sorts of things. I hope my parents hurt. I havent got any close friends. Maybe yes people will feel my absence for a few months, maybe a year, but its not like I would care at that point, and thats such a small time and then they'll get on with their lives. I'm not that important. I just can't see a reason to stay alive?Anyway, my question has more to do with how many become suicidal from apathy specifically. before now its always been suicidal from hatred of myself, and a want to cause myself more pain and hurt and that I was terribly alone. But now? I'm calm and rational, sometimes less depressed than usual, yet death is CONSTANTLY on my mind, and I've accepted everything.","1"

"Hi, as the title says. my main problems are low self confidence, GAD, along with that some obessive thoughts, lack of energy, motivation, i think alot about shit that brings me down, my mind is on the highway 24/7. Different degrees of ""brainfog"" from day to day. Im probably depressed aswell. Anyway, earlier i ate a combo of prozac and wellbutrin, guess it helped me some, but not just enough imo. I got really depressed this last summer, stopped eating all the pills, went to the doctor and said that those pills arent helping me enough, so she gave me lexapro, instead of prozac and wellbutrin on that aswell. I have a very hard time believing the doctor, and its almost like im looking for side effects, anything i do it just feelt wrong.. Anyway, i didnt eat those pills for a long time, i have been without any AD for a couple of months, until i decided now to take any help they might give me, and follow their advice without any questions. So now im on this new one, called brintellix, does this sound like a good AD for my problems? Whenever i dont eat AD i get this thougts my life would me so much better without them, and vice versa... probably a part of GAD/OCD? Cause some of my problems, speaks for low dopamine and or noradrenaline, while some for low serotonin, but ive heard wellbutrin can increase anxiety, and i dont want that, while ive heard SSRI lowers you dopamine. My english isnt perfect :p Anywya why did he give me brintellix, does that sound right for my issues? Or should i go back to wellbutrin and prozac? ","1"
"Everything I do feels off. Everything I say feels like it's coming from someone else. Every time I laugh it feels like I'm faking it. I can't take this anymore. I'm not interested in anything or anyone anymore. I zone out when people talk to me because I just don't care. Not that I want to be like that but there's just something in me that tells me that whatever someone is saying or whatever I am doing is completely pointless. My voice feels flat. I took a depression quiz and wouldn't be able to put this feeling into words until I took this quiz but that is exactly how I feel. I'll just be talking and halfway through I'll just lose interest in what I'm saying and everyone else will too. It just doesn't sound like its coming from me. My mind is cloudy. I can't think straight anymore. I can barely maintain a conversation. My favorite place is in my bed dreaming because I don't have to wake up to the reality that I'm in. I can't talk to anyone about it. How do I tell someone about this? ""Hey uhh I'm depressed"". That would only cause more issues. People wouldn't understand unless they were in my shoes. I know I definitely wouldn't have understood it before I had it. I didn't used to be like this. I used to be funny, confident, outgoing. I had flaws but not like these. I can't take it anymore. I don't think I'd ever be able to go through with killing myself but I'm not going to lie when I cross an intersection deep down i hope I just get hit by a car and die. ","1"
"For almost two weeks I have been extremely depressed. It started the weekend before Thanksgiving. I was getting behind on bills so my boyfriend offered to loan me money to stay afloat. I had no choice (I have already taken out two loans against my 401k and two other loans from banks) so I took it. He makes good money and says it is not a problem for him, and I truly believe him. I know how much he makes vs how much he spends and that he is still living very comfortably even with giving me the money.Fast forward to last week, my cat got extremely sick and needed treatment that cost almost $1k. My boyfriend again offered and paid for everything for her. I am so grateful and thankful for my boyfriend doing that.When I am in my depressed episodes I don't go to work. I work at a bank and get too spaced out to be worth anything when I am depressed. As I deal with people's money (and solving problems related to their money) I just don't go in. I have it set up where as long as I call, I cannot get in trouble for not being there. The time is unpaid but I am not at risk of losing my job.The problem is that I just got paid today and don't have enough to pay my bills. I missed about a month of work over the summer due to another depressed episode, that's why Im so far behind and have taken out so many loans.I feel like a terrible worker. I feel like a terrible cat mom. I feel like a terrible girlfriend. My boss is so understanding and I know I'm so lucky to have my boyfriend to help with my bills. My cat is doing much better too. I just feel so guilty. I'm guilty about missing work and not noticing that my cat was sick. I feel guilty that my boyfriend has to keep bailing me out. I just sit at home and cry and lament all day about what a horrible person I am to the people who care about me. For the first time in a long time I have been having feelings of self harm. I'm so tired of feeling this way. I just want to be better and treat the people who have been so supportive better.Do any of you deal with this terrible guilt? What makes you feel better? ","1"
"I've experienced this since I was about 12 years old. I can't stop longing for the past. Each year that goes by seems to get worse and worse and I long for something from the previous years. Seeing how much time has passed since a certain point disturbs me, and I just can't believe it's been so many years. I don't know what this is. It's like I just can't process time in a normal way. It's like I'm hyper-sensitive to the very idea of time. It feels like home-sickness in a way but is probably more descriptively associated with nostalgia, except nostalgia seems to be described by most as a happy feeling, but this has always been a really somber feeling. I just moved recently and am now starting to realize that I'll probably never live in my old home again. This has been something that I really haven't been able to shake so far and I'm really afraid that it will follow me forever and make life horrible.","1"

"(I know this is really long but it would mean a lot if you could read the whole thing and give some feedback)Im a 17 year old male. Im not sure how i should feel anymore, some days Im happy and enjoy simple things, other days i feel so worthless and depressed i dont even feel like getting out of bed. I have no type of connection or bond with anyone at all whatsoever. I at most just have aquantninces at school that i just make small talk with and crack the occasional joke. The thing that confuses me is I honestly dont know why nobody likes me. Im not saying Im perfect or anything but Im laid back, have a sense of humor, open minded and Im nice. I have even been told so. It makes me feel so shitty when i see people talking about plans they make together, talking about memories they made, taking funny pictures together and bonding. I just sit there thinking to myself why the fuck cant i have something so simple as this. Just a genuine friendship with someone. How awesome would it be to have a group of close friends or just a close friend i could invite for a sleepover, bring snacks, watch movies and spend the whole night having a blast? Or how awesome would it be to plan a road trip with someone and just have an adventure and reminisce about it later? How awesome would it be feel like your important to somebody, and that you matter to them? Im just not the type of person that likes being alone. My mom assumes that the reason why Im alone all the time is because i just have a lone wolf type of personality but its not true at all. I want to have a best friend or at least have good friends but i dont feel a bond with anyone because nobody is willing to get to know me and bond with me. I love my family but i dont have much of a bond with them if that makes sense. I have nothing in common with them and we all have different personalities with different mindsets and ways of thinking so thats leads to a lot of arguments and days of us not even speaking to each other. My mother is very loving, and she is honestly the only person and women in my life that makes me feel like i matter, but in the back of my mind i know its only because i happen to her son, and that a mother will always love her child. But its love thats given, and i want someone to care and love about me because they willingly want to, not because they are biased because of blood relation. It gets me thinking, do i really have to be someones child,brother, or sister to get them to care about me? Im definitely appreciative of my mom, dont get the impression that i treat her badly because i dont, but my point still remains. Finding a girl is just out of the question at this point.i have never been anyones crush, never held hands or even had my first kiss or date. I am completely invisible to them, and when I finally do find a girl that is willing to engage in a conversation with me and make eye contact, I can still tell from their body language and overall way of talking that they are not interested in me. I made the huge mistake of thinking a girl would actually be willing go out on a date with me just because we had a convo. I sat at lunch with her with a mutual friend and thats how we met. She was down to earth, laid back and chill, and she was beautiful. I messaged her on snapchat a few months later to catch up and she gave short answers. Assuming she was just busy, I decided to get to the point and asked if she would like to go out sometime. No answer at all. She left me on read. Havent talked since. This happened a year ago and i still feel shitty about it. Whenever i see her at school i feel so fucking shitty. I feel so terrible that i just want to throw up honestly. Its not because Im obsessed with her, it just a depressing reminder of how Im cant bond with anyone and it sucks that this girl i had a huge crush on had to be an example of that. I have tried everything, whenever Its a day where Im in a good mood and feeling confident it still doesnt change anything. I honestly dont think Im a bad looking dude, i dress well, i dont mean to brag but Im able to afford a lot of nice clothes because my family is wealthy, not living in a mansion, but were definitely financially stable.  Its very rare when i like a girl too, I definitely have high standards because i believe I deserve a quality girl because i really do believe Im worth it, despite this post insecurity is not necessarily an issue for me, so its not confidence. I honestly just want a girl to love me and i love her back, i want us to best-friends at the same time, i want true partnership with a relationship built on trust, respect, loyalty and affection. But most girls my age dont know a clue about any of that or what it means to truly be in love with someone. Sometimes it makes me feel like theres something wrong with me, or that im not worthy of being loved. Why can another guy gain a womens love and affection but not me? I have a fancy car that my mom was nice enough to buy just for me, i got a job to help make payments on it because im not a self entitled brat and i like to earn my possessions. But guess what? I only use it to drive to work, because i have nowhere else to go. Sometimes ill go to chic fil a and eat my food in my car in the parking lot by myself, wondering why the fuck i dont have anyone bumping to music next to me and wondering what the fuck im gonna do with this fancy car. Im not even asking for advice, because i dont think im depressed, i just feel sad sometimes because of this situation, i guess you could say i have my good and bad days. I have become used to walking up in the morning with no message notifications or invites. I have become used to walking in the hallways with girls just walking past me not even looking at me, and ive become used to trying to make a conversation with someone and they just go on their phone and give short answers. It honestly takes two people to bond and connect for any type of relationship be it or romantic or friendship. Sorry for rambling, if you read this whole thing I really do appreciate it, if not thats cool too. Rant over. Goodnight homies","1"
"okay where do I start? - I moved to NY a year ago. I live in my grandma's basement, basically, rent-free. She told me today she has sold the house and the new buyers want it before Christmas. - Not to mention, the same grandma has been diagnosed with breast cancer. We don't know how bad it is. But, we are very close and the thought of losing her makes me upset more than I realize. - I live in NY, I work in NJ. The commute is 5 hours round trip. Since it was my first job out of grad school, I basically didn't have a choice. I had to take it. I work really hard (I've launched a magazine by myself) but I have nothing to show for it. When I took a couple of weeks to go home (then turned into a medical emergency) my boss hired two new full-time people behind my back and basically left me out in the cold. Now, I have to sit there and still do the work I was expected to do and still get paid very very very very very very little. I'm not motivated in the slightest anymore, and I'm basically asking to be let go at this point. - I came to New York to get a job in book publishing and climb up the ladder. Since being at my job (almost a year), I've applied to easily 100+ entry jobs and haven't landed a single interview. I've updated my resume, have written very personal cover letters but still nada zilch. - I'm basically ready to give up on my dreams and just become a receptionist. But, they barely get paid anything. But, I can't afford New York on what I get paid on now. I'm crafting a resume now and I am barely holding it together. - My boyfriend's grandmother died on Friday. She was old but they were close and it's his first time dealing with anyone dying. He's still expected to go to work and carry on as usual but he's angry and mad and he's still grieving. I'm trying to be supportive because I know exactly what he's going through (I've had many people die in my life) and still be a good partner to him. - Moving back home is an option. My parents have made that perfectly clear. But, (as anti-feminist as this sounds) I don't want to leave my partner and the little life I've set up with him. Things are going stupidly well and it makes me feel like I'm back in high school and things are twirly and lovely and terrific. Not to mention, I'd feel like an absolute failure if I were to go back and move back in with my parents. - Did I mention student loans and credit card bills? I'm going to stop there now. I feel like this list is long enough. If anyone has a word of advice, a job offer, or virtual hugs they'd like to give me, I'd really appreciate it. ","1"

At 16 I was diagnosed with depression, severe anxiety and bipolar disorder 2 ( whatever the hell that 2 is supposed to mean) I live with my fianc and his parents and honestly they all make it so much worse. I think about killing myself every single day but I cant do that to my family. I hate how dependent my mom is of my emotional state, if Im mad shes mad, if im feeling depressed shes depressed, if I cry and try to tell her how I feel or whats happening with me, she makes it about herself and ultimately shames me for not being appreciative of the life she gave me. Nothing in life seems enticing, sure memories and experiences, but what after that, what do I do when I have experienced everything I wanted to. The only things I can say I have done in this world that changed for the better was kicking my Xanax and cocaine addiction, finally getting my GED and getting a decent first job at a call center. Speaking of which, Im currently in my local community college to earn my associate in arts degree but fairly enough I dont care, I dont want to do this but dropping isnt an option. Finding a job is almost impossible, I quit my job at the call center because it made me so much more depressed, sitting in a cubicle 9-10 hours a day getting yelled at by not only customers on the phone, but everyone around me. Ive applied to about 12 different places in the last week and I call almost everyday or go in person just to get told if your application meets the requirements well give you a call its hopeless. I guess its my bipolar disorder that makes me think the world will end whenever something happens, even something as minuscule as my fianc talking to a female, any female. I have so many trust issues its literally tearing us apart, worst part of it is he would never cheat on me and I know it, I still treat him like shit whenever I get mad. My attitude has become such a problem in the last 2 years I seriously fear he will leave me. We argue (hard) almost every other day, I can feel it all taking such an enormous toll on my mental. I have come to my wits end I dont know what to do with myself anymore, unmotivated, no desire to do anything, getting so irrationally mad at anything, seeing myself in this situation doing something I dont want to every day, not having a single dollar, getting nagged to do something or chores every time I leave the room, being talked down to.I have tried medicine and it really only made me gain weight, Im unsatisfied with how I look and what Im doing in life and I cant even muster up enough motivation to do something about it. I honestly dont even know what to expect in the comments because it just sounds like Im complaining, Im the biggest if theres something wrong and you know how to fix it, do it believer I cant think of and yet I cant even start to fix my own damn life. I hate myself and I dont know what else to do but suicide.","1"
"I'm 23, I've been looking for one for over an year after dropping out of university cause of a breakup and depression, I've felt better lately even though I have no income and I'm living with my parents.So I found a job today and I feel as depressed as one year ago, it's a job as a factory worker, full time, for only 500 euros/month. It fucking sucks, I need it, my parents would be angrier at me than they already are, but it fucking sucks.I can't deal with the fact that I have to do a repetitive job in a awful place for 8 hours every day, it fucking sucks, it makes me feel worthless and suicidal, I don't want to do it, I really don't want to, I'd kill myself if I wasn't that scared of death, but what's the point in living if I gotta do an awful job the whole day, every day, I can't deal with it, I'm so sad, depressed, I just wanna go back to bed and never get out ","1"
"I can't help but wonder what's the point of it anymore.....why do we bother to work, and slave away for money. Money that 99.9% of us don't even own anymore, it's like they watch us doing it as some twisted joke. Maybe something Truman-Show esque, who knows if theres anybody watching....I think theres always someone watching. the aspect of privacy is gone, what with all the technology there's almost a guarantee that someones watching at all times. What do they want though? and why would they watch me? there's nothing special about me I don't even leave the house much....I just wonder if they'll stop watching ever and maybe I'll actually be alone.

"Hi everyone, I figured a good place to start with this would be a little bit of my background. I'm an eighteen year old male from Muncie, Indiana and my situation is one that I think any people will be sympathetic to. I graduated highschool last May, however i wasn't accepted into any of the colleges I applied to due to my tendencies to procrastinate and ignore things that don't challenge my mind to a level I feel worth putting time into. Keep in mind, I'm fully aware of how naive this mindset is now. Anyway, following graduation I decided to move out, live the American dream, work 40 hours and be sufficient. This is what my whole life had previously been living up to and now I'm left with a feeling of sheer emptiness that has been brought on by the loneliness and frustration that comes with this stagnant lifestyle. While I have a girlfriend whom I care very deeply for, I still find disappointment in the mundane and everyday. Observing my friends who were accepted into colleges, they are full of purpose and enjoyment for what they are doing, which only further extenuates this feeling of helplessness and depression. With this in mind, I was hoping reddit might have some meaningful comments or advice as to what I should do to find purpose in my life, or at least a guide in the right direction. While I find myself picking things up easily I never have been able to find that one passion or that thing that i can always go back to, I aspire to be an artist of some kind but can't ever seem to dedicate myself to ant medium as they all have lead to more depression and self doubt.While this is clearly just a lack of motivation and desire, I hope some of you could provide experiences that lead you to find what in this world you wanted to do or at least what steps have lead you to becoming closer.  Thank you","1"

"I'm so sick of it all, my dad was killed in August, we hadn't spoken for two years because he was quite emotionally manipulative and by the end of our relationship he said some awful things and I couldn't continue our relationship, but for years we were super close even though he put us through a lot.I've been through a lot as a person, I'm 28 and I'm a mum and I do my best I really do, but the things that have happened have shaped me aswell, I'm shy, anxious, low self esteem type person, I doubt myself so much, I want to be a happy person, who does a lot, who gets it right. I feel like a failure compared to my siblings, two of them have great jobs, one is getting married next year happily, they have tons of friends and great social lives, I was the black sheep, I moved out young, got in an abusive relationship, got depression and then developed anxiety disorder, I've been sexually assaulted 3 times in my life once by a very close friend, I've been hit, had my life threatened, I've been emotionally manipulated, what is wrong with me why couldn't I spot the threat, I get told I'm too trusting and I do too much for people, I guess a bit co-dependant, but why am I like this but my sister is the opposite, why does she excel in everything she does, and i'm sat struggling for money, I remember one time I went for an appointment and the lady said well at least you did raising your daughter well, and I have, she's confident, funny, kind, does so well at school but her mother is pathetic, I hide my pain from her the best I can, but it's all I've done and I'm only just keeping my head above water.Sorry long post but who else am I going to tell all this to","1"
"On the surface everything looks fine. I have a decent job where I do well and I have my own place to live but that's where it ends. My life has no meaning and no purpose. I've been battling this for a while but tonight I barely held it together on my commute home and had to dig my keys into my hand to focus on something, then I broke down when I got home and locked the door.I'm at an age where the few friends I had are married and have all moved away so I don't have any social life and I don't have anyone to talk to, let alone confide in.Sometimes I just want the screaming in my head to stop so much. At work I put on a cheerful face. I don't want anyone to know how I really feel. Last night was the office party and I shouldn't have gone but went for appearances sake and then it brings it all home to me how isolated I really am and how I can't relate to what goes on at these things.There's literally nothing going on in my life and I've lost the drive to even try to find something to give it meaning now. I don't expect to ever be happy but I don't want to keep living like this.Is there anything you can do on your own to combat these feelings? I don't know if it's actually depression but whatever it is it's getting to the stage where it feels overwhelming and pretend there's nothing wrong is tiring.","1"

I can feel myself falling down again. For the past three weeks things had started to look better: I finally started visiting a therapist, got some piano-playing motivation back, not a single suicidal/self-harming thought etc.  Few days ago it all just started to crumble again. The feeling of hopelessness and loneliness the feeling that I have no skills and that I am worthless. The feeling that I have no place nor no future in this society. I can feel these thoughts washing over and drowning me like a tidal wave that I cannot dodge.","1"

"Please point me to a better sub if this is not the appropriate place for this, or if there is a better sub to discuss  this on.I have had life long trauma and depression and a bi-polar shit life. A lifetime of experimental medications. Several hospitalizations due to inability to control myself in various ways. A lifetime of trying to learn whats up with my head. Im sure its not much different than some of you out there.Last year I was prescribed Wellbutrin after attempting yet another string of drug/counseling experiments to see what works best for me. It was a difference  of night and day.  I sung out loud as my brain settled and life became far more manageable. I did suffer short term side effects as I started. Wellbutrin has a very unique side effect feeling, making it very discernible from other drugs.So ya, a good year has gone by feeling good in the most part. Zero complaints.2 weeks ago, a few basic life situations elevated in stress. Fam. Dating. Work. Health. All low level stressors, and not out of the ordinary for me. But apparently these things spun into some sort of mania I am now suffering. Whatever the reason, Im out there and unable to focus or be around people in a semi normal way.Then something interesting happened and this is the point where my question comes in.Out of the blue, mid way into this manic state, I am now suffering hard side effects from the wellbutrin. Its as if the mania and wellbutrin arent working together. Im suffering full blown side effects in a far more powerful way than I did at the beginning. Pretty much 70% of everything listed in MD. Some of which are dangerous and scary to me and others.I wonder if others are familiar with such an issue or have any tips which can lead me to more research. Is this something which may pass?One major thing with wellbutrin side effects is rage. With this rage, comes paranoia on what reality is. I cant tell if others are pissing me off  or if I am just overly sensitive...a term I have heard many times in life. Now I  am lost as to how I appear to others. Am I loosing it and no one is degrading me? Am I loosing it and others are degrading me and I am being too soft and not protecting myself?I just dont know. Im so confused to what reality is right now. Im guessing this rant makes little sense to others and you will read it with confusion.  I do know one thing...Im doing my best to keep my mouth shut, because I feel I may destroy my life if I reveal my feelings and or concerns. I figure a faceless reddit rant may be best.","1"

The realization that I'm 27 and it seems like my time to hop on the transition between ""full of potential"" to ""potential manifest"" is getting ever-tighter.

It's hard to not suffocate under the weight of feeling like you should ""be something"" by now, whatever that is. I don't necessarily mean fame and fortune or any of that jazz. I just mean ""something."" Instead, here I am, toiling along, out one rut, into another; rinse and repeat. I feel like I've become that guy now where people say, ""He had a lot of potential.""

"Went to the doctors (GP) today for a bunch of things bad back (scoliosis), bad knee and my depression. Now it is important that you know that sport is the only thing that I enjoy doing, besides gaming,and I haven't been able to do it due to my knee and therefore I am just spiralling further into depression. Now given that I have a 10 minute appointment I thought it was reasonable that I could discuss at least the two most important (they ask for your ailments before you attend) those being my knee and my depression. I get there and they are running late ( as usual) so my appointment time is already going to be cut. We then spend half the time discussing my issues only for her to say ""I can only deal with one"" now baring in mind that, as those who are truly depressed will understand, getting my depression sorted at this point almost seems pointless due to feeling numb and the rest. So I choose the knee, she then proceded to question me about my knee (I had noticed her looking at me oddly as we walked to her room) long story short she accused me of taking to long to answer questions, i was just trying to give accurate details, and seemed to be accusing me of something. To be honest not really sure what my problem was just felt like I was being interrogated, despite her knowing of my depression complaints. That and the fact that I now have to wait another week when I am sitting on a razors edge.TL;DR Doctormade me choose between what injury I wanted looking at and then proceeded to make it seem like I was trying to get something from her I.e. drugs","1"

"Before Reading this I know this is a lot but I would really appricate anyones help right now.Lets say Ive tried writing about this a lot of time but Ive usually failed or I deleted the file because I wasnt happy with it. Im here to tell whoever is listening my story. You can hold your own opinion over this because Ive gotten to the point of life where Id really do anything for a better tomorrow. Ive dug my own holes repeatedly and Ive let people do whatever they would please with me and it tears me apart to not see me happy anymore I cant get a hold of my life and my lifes just become one disaster train.A cold feeling, I receive all the time reminds me of everything, some days when things seem like absolute hell I go into a mode of thinking which brought me here in the first place. I just want to speak about the Sheldon I once had a while ago, probably around half a year ago where everything started to get worse. A lot of it is myself to blame because I was such a nice and caring person like I always have been. This person drove me into the complete shit in my life, feeling completely controlled and no longer belonging in my own body. Most people would straight away think of a girl breaking my heart or something to do with a girl, well fuck I wish it was this right now. I am a complete straight guy, but yeah, I let a fucking gay guy totally running my life and you know whats even better? If I end our friendship well lead to me finally being happy and me ruining a lot of his life probably. Something Im not exactly proud of is he feel in love with me but obviously I didnt because Ive never had any sexual feelings towards him. Lets start where all of this began, 3 years ago we meet each other and become good friends over the course of 1 and half years. Its quite hard for me to think of the good now after all this shit but yeah a while back we were quite good friends This was also mainly due to my school issues at the end the time and he was the person there for me at that time which was great at the time. Back at that time I didnt know he had any sexual feelings towards me, but now I purely see why he did what he did for so long is because of his fucked-up feelings towards me. Around the end of that point he eventually told me he was bisexual, but I didnt see a problem with it because my best friend in Austria has been gay and we still to the day are amazing friends, obviously he had never shown any sexual feelings towards me. But our candidate who caused us all this pain was a little older than our Austrian gay friend Iman. So, for the next half a year, an era I call the 2nd Phase of Terror, which ran between 1.5 to 2 years after meeting him.Phase 2 now when I look at it was okay, I mean occasionally I didnt enjoy the tension or friction we had. It was a phase I probably was the nicest and most interested in him in terms of being friends but also a time where I only realized afterwards the harm I was causing to me and him. This was the time which caused things to get as bad as now Nowadays this time often gets referenced by him to see how things used to be good and how I am changing basically playing emotional warfare with me. I mean I probably really did enjoy this time a lot as he filled the void of me never having a best friend or someone who truly enjoyed spending time. I mean I had no girlfriend at the time and was lonely, so I just had some fun and he taught me growing up in a way.Now lets get to the Third Phase and my current phase of this pile of shit. I can quite clearly identify the start of this era through me Captaining a good team of his. I was a pretty inexperienced player at the time and saw this thrill of power as a huge opportunity. Well one straight problem was him becoming my Owner at that moment and the power he held above me in that case. I had a lot of responsibilitys and I was still a kid at the time, so I made a lot of errors because It was like being thrown into a working environment at a high school age, which demolished my nice person, as I just took everything and blamed myself. I know there was a lot of things he took for me to protect me, but he feared losing me if I leave. I asked plenty of times to step down but there was nobody in my team who could fill my shoes, but I also think he feared losing me as Id become less involved with him. As the year carried I went through a whole 2 months relationship that I hide from him because he hated Indian girls and since I was dating her, he didnt like that I was touching something Indian. This was mostly easy to hide as I could just lie about something and it was still in a time where he didnt control my whole life. Throughout the year he caught me lying and this made him even more paranoid regarding his say in my life. In that year June and July came around exams came around and my marks went into the complete shits. I had just gotten together with my crush/my best friend. She was about the only thing keeping me happy throughout my tough times. The Reason my marks went into the shits in June was mainly due to the anxiety I had built up through this clan, as I constantly got shit on for doing something wrong and this also caused a lot of stress. I would basically go offline and tell people Id study but, I just avoided people. I did try to study more but somehow my brain wasnt with my body no longer. I had at that time lost my happiness and I didnt know to regain it but get rid of this one person causing it in my life. This also marks the point in time when everything started to get worse. I started to get more anxious and stressed about the clan and pressure mounted on me as our team was doing very well. I also had to start investing more time into the Clan and started to get scared of going out else I might be shit on by him even more, as it was probably happening weekly now. His implementation of the bedtime during the week also started to hurt me inside more and more as I felt like I was living the same day repeatedly. I started to feel like a criminal on social media as everything I posted or did would have an impact on him maybe getting angry at me as he had in the past for saying if I can doo that with someone else why not with him. He slowly started implementing things from his life onto me where he had past experiences, like dont drink or go out to club: This came in many regards of my life, I started to feel I need an approval stamp about everything from him now and slowly I had to tell him more and more where I was or what I was doing, as he slowly started to turn into a complete control freak.Now comes a part where things started getting worse in my relationship, with me fearing going out I hardly ever saw Taryn (my girlfriend). I really wanted to as she was the one thing bringing me happiness everyday and putting a smile on my face. This impacted our relationship also as I was hiding obvious problems that I refused to speak about and just told her only later a fraction of the story as it was extremely complicated. I le him now destroy my relationship by letting him take my time and make him control me. I was such a weak-minded person that it was hard for me to get out of it. I started to hate every time he made me see him in real life as he was now longer that friend he used to be to me. I avoided seeing him and made sure to always have an excuse for not being to make it but funny wise often things came about on the weekends he wanted to see me. More days turned into days where I would avoid WhatsApp as much as I could and would mainly try to keep my mind of it by thinking clear or going into a life thinking mode. Many days turned into disasters as I would just be sad the whole day and could no longer see the positivise. After all my marks had been through the gutter and I was becoming more anxious and scared by the day. At times I was struggling to do well in videogames and tennis and I just saw no more good in my life. I felt like I Had no more control over myself and slowly what I used to help me escape reality would turn into my fear of being caught playing the wrong times or not without him, which would cause his wrath of anger. Rage came about, and we played at SAs highest level and did extremely well but still I didnt feel amazing about after all the harm it caused to me over the year. After that point I thought things would get better, but they barely did as he still controlled me and soon exams hit so I basically had no time or will to go out because exams were coming, and my girlfriend was busy, so I only ever did anything with my family. I had slowly started speaking to my brother about this whole thing and one loyal friend which mostly just help me be able to rant my problems to someone without me exploding of frustration. I had also forgotten a crucial event in the 3rd phase being the time I cried at school about all of this before speaking to a school councillor. This happened just before the Justin Bieber Concert after a huge fight of me not telling him about it. After Rage I also told him I had a girlfriend and he was infuriated as I told him Id wait but that was about 4 months of waiting I had done in books even though I had gotten together a while ago because I couldnt wait else I might lose her. At that moment I again lied to him about how long id been together and basically told him a date which he would get less angry with as he is extremely emotional like a child. Lets just say I cant feel who I am anymore I feel like a robot who has to daily report to him because when I dont he phones me a million times or even wants to drive to my house as he knows where I Live. I never wanted thing to get as bad as they did but his guilt driven things he says make me feel bad and the blackmail influences me on a deeper emotional and mental level. Ive been mentally and emotionally damaged hugely and just want my old life back. The Pain should just end now and Im still lost as he fell in love with me but expects the same but in a way of attention and Im basically all he has in life now meaning Ill crush his soul but its the only way to make me happy now after all of this. I also just want my relationship to go back to normal and everything else will fall into place.I just need help right now and I do need to speak to more people about this","1"

Because of my social withdrawal after previous experiences plus looks that only plastic surgery could deal with, Im unable to find anyone.For all these years Ive been feeling like I was carrying a vessel full of feelings I cannot share with anyone. Yep, its cringy af but Im literally full of love I dont know what to do with. I really dont know what I should do and I feel like Im about to burst.","1"

"It'll be a rant, sorry, I need to vent.So, I've been having a therapy for over a month. For now it only makes me depressed, because we're at the point of talking about my past, my personality, summing it up etc., so all that bad and painful stuff is being brought up from its dark place where it was hiding and it hurts as fck.I'm very into that psychological stuff and like to read about it to know more about myself. And I recently discovered that I'm codependent. From my parents. With my dad not helping, who is emotionally immature and has his own problems and uses me as his ""sweet daughter"", who is to make him happy and feel loved, so basically he's making me his parent and gets furious when I refuse and try to be independent.So I decided that this weekend I'm not going to my parents house (as I do every weekend), because being there only makes me depressed and anxious. And now I AM depressed and anxious because of not going to visit them. Because... And that's silly, I really don't know! Because dad will be upset? Because he's become addicted to me? Everytime I visit my parents he runs to me with his arms opened, to hug me and tell how happy he is to see me, literally like a toddler seeing his parent. So then I'm trying to remind myself ""It is OKAY for you to stay home and not visit your parents, they're adults, they'll be fine, you have the right for some time for yourself"". But then I'm anxious again, because I'm showered with guilt, all anxious and sad that I've disappointed my parents, that I have free time and don't spend it with my family etc. IT SUCKS. And I'm seeing my therapist next week, not on Friday as always, GOD HELP ME.","1"
"Copied and pasted from my earlier thread because this is the most i've gone in depth about my life and i'm too fucking lazy to bother re-writing.My whole life has been in misery. Since I was young, Beaten for the crime of being autistic, shamed by my religious parents because they saw my Autism was a curse from god for their sins.I was also beaten a lot. Brooms, things on the table, etc. Whatever they could grab and wherever it landed. I attempted suicide at 17, still debate if it was the right choice that I didn't. I wanted to move away and make something for myself. So I applied for wellfare and moved to the city a couple hours away. I went to college until I had a nervous breakdown. I tried to get a job as a clerk and the same thing. So I signed up on disability. Every day for the past two years was just existing to exist. I found love and was finally happy for the first time in over a decade until they used me for my money and abused me. All because I was too much of a coward to say anything mean to them.Now i've spent the past year. Living. Eating. Occasionally cutting myself. Everything that once mattered is gone. I used to believe that I could beat depression. But even with whatever meds I shove down my throat, it never stops. I have come so far since then for nothing but me. I don't improve my life to seem better for others or to woo people. I did it for me. Because if I didn't, I would be dead. And I see these people trying to make this sickness romantic. My ex wanted a monster to cure. She thought my life was romantic because of how fucked up I am.Seriously, why do people want to pretend there's something romantic about this? Or they think it's cute when I don't let people in my life. Do people actually think I write poetry or i'm some deep intellectual lost soul waiting to find someone to free me?You wanna know what I do? I lock myself in my room and wait to feel starving pain. i think of every bad moment in my life and honestly debate if it's worth it. I question if my death would have made everyone's lives easier. I literally can't make myself get up. I'm losing control of myself. And not one person on this damn earth cares. ","1"
"Sorry for my bad english.I just can't take it anymore, first of all some days ago i tried to kill myself but it didn't go well, i don't have many friends, i can't always ask my mom to help me because she feels bad when i tell her how i always feel bad, she and my gf are the only one who knows about my suicide attemp, my gf got super upset and i understand her, after all, its all my fault, i have been screaming to her that i seriously need help but she says:""Well, you are always sad anyway"" and i feel way worse, i really don't know what to do, i feel so bad, everything feels worse and i have been thinking about trying to kill myself again, by hanging myself but the painless way (breaking my neck), or going to the train station and throw myself to the rails. I just want to stop feeling this horrible sensation, this loneliness, i want to stop thinking.","1"
"Every mistake I made will not matter in the end, so what's the point? Sometimes I ask to me why I don't just forget my depressed girlfriend. She just wants to die and I stop her everytime. She's so young and she has so much pain and suffering inside. If I weren't so selfish, I would let her go. Seriously, she is suffering too much in this world, and it hurts to admit it. She says that I'm the only one who can make her smile, that makes me feel important, too important. Sometimes I think about letting her go, but I love her. She has been through too much suffeeing and she's SO FUCKING YOUNG. Can't accept that. She doesn't deserve this. Help.","1"

I didn't really do anything about i, so i just kept sleeping. Couple minutes later i almost fainted instead of falling asleep. I felt that my hands, face and legs are numb and cold. Oh boy, my body had a panic attack and my blood pressure was huge. 3 days later i still feel that something is not right. My heart beats are very heavy.I can't smoke cigarettes any more, because i suspect they might worsen my situation. Yet that was the only thing that i loved to do.Fuck. I fail so much in life.","1"
"I don't know if this belongs in suicide watch. I don't want to commit suicide, but I think my friend might have just done so. I guess I'll know for sure in a few days, when he doesn't contact me. He was or is severely depressed. I'm not going to talk about all of his issues here, because there are a lot of them. The only relevant information for now is that he is or was suicidal, that I've talked him out of suicide before, and he didn't have a lot of friends. I was one of his only friends, and he is or was also one of mine.Two nights ago we were talking on the phone about our relationships. I told him that I once told my [current] boyfriend that I loved him but that he didn't say that he loved me back. He told me that he was once in a relationship with a girl and the same thing happened, and that it made him lose interest in her, sort of insinuating that that same thing might happen to me. He was trying to give me advice, I guess. I started crying. He didn't exactly know that I would have reacted the way I did, but then again that isn't really the type of thing you say to someone if you're trying to help them with something. I told him that I needed some time alone and hung up.Now, I have a problem with being confident in relationships. Long story short, I've dated some shitty people and people who made me feel insecure, guilty, and generally badly about myself (and I'm sure most of you can understand or have experienced what I'm talking about). Because of that I've felt really insecure about a lot of my relationships, not just the romantic/sexual ones. The guy I'm dating now is a total sweetheart and we've been dating for almost 9 months now, but in the beginning of the relationship I was really scared about losing him because I can get really emotional at times. A month or so ago I finally started to feel more confident about this relationship because it's lasted so long.So, after I hung up on my friend (and went to sleep, because it was night time), he sent me a bunch of messages saying that he was sorry, he didn't mean it, etc. I know that he didn't mean to hurt me, even though he didn't use the best advice. When I woke up, I told him that I would talk to him for a few days because I was angry about what he said, but that he shouldn't be afraid of losing me as a friend. I just needed some time to ""recuperate,"" essentially. Last night he messaged me again, saying that he was 'leaving,"" and that he was sorry. From talking to him before when he was like this I knew that he meant that he was going to kill himself. Then he blocked me and deactivated his account before I could reply.Not too long ago, he activated his account I guess, because he started talking to me again. He said that the way he said goodbye last night wasn't the proper way to go. Then he sent a few long messages that all boiled down to him not wanting to need people anymore when they didn't need him. He said that hurting me was essentially the tipping point. Then he blocked me again, and hasn't talked to me since.If my reaction to what he said was his tipping point, I don't know if I'll ever be able to forgive myself. On the other hand, what he said really did hurt me. It's going to take everything in me to convince myself that it wouldn't be my fault if he killed himself, and even then I don't know if it will be enough. Does this mean that I should be completely selfless and not be offended when people deeply hurt my feelings? I don't even know if this is me being ""offended"" or if it's more me just being scared and hurt. And now I feel awful for making this post about myself, when it should be about my friend possibly just committing suicide. I don't even know what to think anymore.","1"
"(Idk if this is the right sub, if its not please direct me to it.) (also Im writing this while feeling like shit so sorry if it is garbled.) Im a 21 year old male, and to this day my parents continue to physically and verbally abuse me. I attend university and hold a job, and to everyone else I must seem like a normal dude. However, Im not.My dad is mostly just complicit, but my mom degraded me every day, throws shit around the house, and occasionally hits me with wires, belts, or hangers. Shes my mom so obviously I cant physically fight back, so mostly I just attempt to run or cover as much of my body as I can. I usually yell and scream at her in response, but Ive never told her any bad words or told her to shut up. She also constantly tells me every insult and curse word imaginable, and at this point it Just kind of rolls off. Im not the best son, I can be lazy but IBe never done anything that I think has ever warranted this type of behavior. Its been like this my entire life, and I think I just recently Ive noticed the effects on my life. I have severe social anxiety, to the point where I cant talk to a stranger one on one face to face (parties, social events, etc) unless its in a professional setting  or ask my professor questions during office hours. Its been like this for as long as I can remember, and I hate it. I cant even talk to my gfs friends because I feel so judged by them, even if they are just being nice people. I also went from a As and Bs college student to complete trash, and its not that I cant understand the material, I just cant bring myself to work if that makes any sense. I would just sit in my schools computer lab and not type anything for hours upon end. I wouldnt turn in any work but I would still attend class and actively participate and know the material. It got to the point where I wanted to kill my self , because I felt the only thing that my parents wanted (for me to get a college edu) was slipping from me, the only thing that would make my parents happy.The thing is, my mom had a fucked up childhood. Her mom left her to grow up at my great grandmas house until she was 12, and then took her back in when she (great grandma) died. She would constantly degrade her and beat her, and would always have men who were drunk in her home. Her 15 year old brother was addicted to meth, and would constantly have hallucinations and scream in the home. At one point, my grandma shaved her head and forced her to go to school like that. This all happened in Mexico btw. I dont know what to do, as my mom has never failed her motherly duties and has been always caring and taken us to the doctor and everything. I feel guilty being angry at her or feeling bad about myself when all this stuff happened to her. And this is further personified whenever I try to talk to my older sister, as she just says just understand what my mom had to go through. I wanna move out, but I cant move out because of financial insecurity. I also feel guilty because my parents gave me so much when we had so little, idk I just dont know what to do or feel. ","1"
"Im really not good at communicating my feelings but ill try. Ive never been to a specialist but ive been depressed since I was about 15 (currently 22). At least I think its depression, I dont know if its another mental disorder or mood issue. Ive never been to a specialist or any type of therapist, so i really dont know whats wrong with me. Some days will be great and some days im at rock bottom. Lately its been sky highs during the day and extreme lows closer to night time and throughout the night when I cant sleep. Kinda like tonight, I had an amazing day, but as soon as I locked myself up in my room i started feeling the weight of my emotions feel heavy. Last year I was baker acted for attempting suicide, it was around this time last year. I went as far as to cut myself tonight and I havent since then. After I laid in bed and started crying because I felt guilty. Idk if i feel guilty i didnt end it or guilty bc i promised myself i wouldnt do it again..Its hard to explain my emotions because I rarely talk about them, the thoughts are always in my mind but when i try to speak them out loud it doesnt come out right or i cant explain myself. Theyre aligned in my mind but when i try to speak its just a fuckery of words. I feel worthless all the time, i feel like everyone around me is pretending to like me or using me. I just feel unappreciated all of the time. Im always friendly with people and im respectful. I never know if its something im doing wrong or if its just everyone else? I dont feel connected to anyone, i dont feel like i fit in anywhere, i never hear from my friends unless i message them first and sometimes when i do message them i get ignored, when i share my feelings theyre ignored or just dismissed. Im not really sure what the point of this post is anymore, i guess i just wanted to vent and get it all out, i hope someone understands and can give me a few tips on not ending my life. I tried to explain as well as i could but theres way more that i just cant explain because i am so tired","1"
"I'm 18 and have recently decided to self refer myself for therapy. I have struggled with a whole bunch of problems in my life for a good few years. I think from when I was 12 I realised  the extent to which my family was messed up. to start with, I am from a multi faith multi cultural family and if it isn't apparent, this is probably where most of my problems stem from. My dad is an obnoxious, arrogant and self centred control freak who has always felt the need to practically undermine me and dictate everything I do from how I'm meant to think to what I'm meant to wear. Ofcourse at 13 I became rebellious which did not result in a great outcome. due to his insensitive, ignorant and uneducated mindset (my dad hasn't had a proper education. he dropped out of school at 13) I made a bad decision. that year was probably the worst year of my life so much happened that has just destroyed me emotionally. Yet i bottled it all up and tried my best to carry on as if life were normal... its far from normal. my parents honestly hate each other and i have been the bridge between them from the minute my brain could retain memories. there has been many times where i have had to actively wedge myelf between the two of them just to avoid anything horrendous happening. this was when i was growing up so just before I was in secondary school. about the time I was 11. I just don't understand why they always would feel the need to criticise eachother and tell me about it so I'd basically be the one fed the hate from whatever new spat they got into. I know for a fact this messed wih my emotional state because now I have no idea what the hell im meant to dofrom the time i was in secondary school everything  basically just kept going downhill. My mum was gonna leave my dad but ofcourse that hasnt happened. now my dad is saying he's leaving but ofcourse that wont happen either. and as always im stuck between the two. one minute they hate eachother and the nex my mums being nice or my dads being nice and then the next i have my mum bawling her eyes out expressing all her regrets about marrying my dad and ive had to deal with this rollercoater for 18 years. I genuinely cant take it anymore. so that is why i have now started therapy. loads of family issues. no way to express it. i became quite an angry person but the anger is aimed at myself. when i was 15 id iit myself out of anger if i felt i ruined something like an outing with my friends or if i got into an argument with my boyfriend. i tug on my hair when im stressed. i have several panic attacks a week. most times i just can't breathe properly and i cry myself to sleep because i just feel like total trash. my doctor told me that the symptoms are that of mild/chronic depression, though i coulda told her that. on top of the frequent family drama i have several arguments with my boyfriend over what seems so futile to me. i feel like he is still a child but i love him so i have to get through it. i try talk to him about this and he used to be supportive but now i guess hes just sick of hearing it and i dont blame him. im sick of it too. i just feel shit all the time.im quite a sociable person but recently I've lost most of my friends because I did work a very tough job that consumed my free time and i got pissed at one friend and because its a clique thing they all basically choose her over me which is ironic because they all have issues with her and i was the one they always came to complain to. I usually tried to remain impartial.i didnt have much of a social life the past few years because i put my time into revision for exams.i am now a fresher in college and once again another big let down in my life. Everyone has their groups in my course but surprise surprise im the one on the outside looking in. i do have a want to like feel like  i belong and being an island isnt nice for me. i talk to everyone but theres no set friends of mine yet. i still feel like everyones an acquaintance of mine and the first semester is already over. oh yeah and my dad has been ignoring me for the past four months i might as well be dead to him. He is ignoring me for reasons of his own that no one in their right mind could comprehend there is no talking to that man. I apologise if this sounds crazy but i really just felt like this was the right place to post it. I'm hoping therapy will help me fix how broken i am. i dont like feeling so empty. I cry all the time and i hate it. for years ive basically put on a happy face but its really not true. im honestly broken inside. I've no self esteem anymore and quite frankly im just on egg shells all the time with my emotions. im scared of being happy because i dont wanna go back to how i feel the majority of the time. i just feel so hopeless, useless like i shouldnt even bother. that its better to hide in the dark than feel happy because feeling happy just wont last long. Tl/dr: I am 18, a fresher at college and have been struggling emotionally for years now and decided to self refer to therapy because of my dysfunctional family that always uses me as a bridge between the two of them as well as social problems I've recently been experiencing. Because of all this i feel isolated and alone. The emotional problems have left me unable to handle it the best way so i self harm when angry, upset or just feel crappy. because of all this i decided its time i sought professional help because i'm obviously not coping very well.

"Today I had remembered a twilight zone episode that I saw many years ago. It had to do with a criminal dieing and he believes he's gone to heaven since he gets whatever he wants. However, he finds that he is actually in hell after he discovered that getting everything only made everything pointless and dull. Everything I have thought would improve my life and happiness has come true. I always wanted someone to love me, ended up married for several years before getting divorced. Wished I could get a new job and got it now iv been there for 5 years and couldn't be more depressed. Met the most amazing girl at that job that even when I unintentally pushed her away she was always there for me. And when she got a promotion I sank into a deeper depression since I didn't get to see her as often. I began to ignore her since I didn't want to bother her with my problems and she ended up married and recently had a child. I saw her today and thats what breaks my heart, she's still here for me after everything I put her through but I lost the only person who I could connect with and just be happy. I know this is a small list but my life is full of examples. If you made it through that thank you for your time. I hope all of you can eventually live happy lives. Don't take anything for granted, appreciate what you have now and if you eventually find the love of your life don't let them go. Already being severely depressed and now heartbroken..

"Depression for me is a cycle. The beginning everything feels okay. But as the cycle continues to progress you're left feeling empty, sad, and broken. I experienced the worst grief that I've ever felt in my young adult life so far. When I was 15 my father passed away. Since then I've gone through bouts of depression. I miss him everyday and I feel like even though its been 5 years, I still wait for him to get home from work or take me on a drive. Sitting in the passenger seat of my father's car as he drove through the most beautiful places in my home state are memories that I will forever cherish. Now I'm in college and it kills me that I can't tell my dad how my day went or how I feel about my classes or about the boy that I really like. Living with depression just seems normal to me. I'm stuck in this negative mindset that recently just occurred in the last few months. I'm beat myself up for every little thing that I do. I care too much about how other view me and I cry in bed feeling so alone and broken. My heart aches with loneliness, I curl up in a ball and cry and pray to God that he'll take my feelings away and become an empty shell. I'd rather be apathetic than feel anything at this point. I've come to realize how unwanted I am amongst my peers, my body aches with the amount of loneliness and sadness I feel on a daily basis. ","1"
"just ranting... I've had depression for most of my life but I feel it has gotten worse since dropping out of school. I've been unemployed for what I feel is way too long, and I'm really struggling finding one where I at least land  a job interview, I feel constantly kicked to the gutter like yesterdays garbage. I can't even land a job as a cleaner, like wtf is this world where you have to have ""a certain set of skills"" to fucking scrub faeces from the toilet...Oh and I have extremely terrible social anxiety that has plagued my whole life which is really tough to cope with.For a while now I've been having what I think are suicidal thoughts, something I have never had before, I even remember saying to my mum when I was younger, when a girl at my school killed herself over bad final exam scores, that I would never kill myself because I love life, but i was so naive back then... Even though I have these thoughts to end it, apart of me is too much of a coward to actually do anything, because I have a wonderful woman in my life that gives me a sign of hope at the end of the day that everything will work out for me in the end... but I'm still fucking waiting.I tried my best for years to find a job, something I have aspired for, for so fucking long, with nothing working out after all this time, I feel as if the universe doesn't want me to succeed... I know it's all in my head but I fucking hate this immense sadness I feel whenever my girl isn't here to remind me the good things to look forward too in this world. I'm sick of the same routine, I want to get out and live life, and brush off this dark entity I call depression following me around wherever I go.... Someone give me a shot to shine... I try to vent all my pain in rap songs, something that calms and relaxes me, but it only lasts for so long before I feel like utter shit again and the damn cycle repeats itself...Thinking about killing myself and leaving everything behind scares the shit out of me, waking up everyday and living life not having a purpose scares the shit out of me. Overall, depression sucks...","1"
"Here me out and don't get me wrong--suicide will undoubtedly affect those around me in a big way. My mom would be heartbroken; My friends would cry for weeks, BUT I'm quite certain they'd get over it. And I don't mean that in a harsh or intense self loathing way. Honestly, like most hardships in most people's lived they'd be upset, mourn my loss, and move on, enjoying the memories. I don't think I'd shatter anyone's life so I don't see why that's ever counted as a means to guilt trip a suicidal person into living a miserable life. ""That's such a selfish thing to do to your loved ones.""They'd get to live on and move past that hurt, whereas I'm stuck hurting living a life I don't want just to appease others. Plus, selfish isn't always a bad thing. Here in this community, we can fathom what major or seemingly minor things could push someone to kill themselves. In a depressive episode, your suffering is all you can see, I'm sorry if I don't consider how my sister will be sad for a while and then simply adjust to life without me.","1"
"A little over five years ago, I had what the doctor called a ""widow maker"" heart attack.  As a result I had a quadruple bypass.  Initially, they said they wouldn't need to stop my heart, but circumstances changed and they did have to stop it and put me on a heart/lung machine.  I had a very quick recovery.  I was back at work in less than a month from the heart attack.  The problem is, I don't think all of what makes me who I am came back when they restarted my heart.  My emotions are all over the chart and I sometimes have to fight the depression so hard that I'm exhausted.

"I go to a famous high school for gifted students. It requires you to take an entrance exam on the major that you choose. Things have been going well last year, but now when I am in my second year, school just makes me feel so freaking depressed. I couldn't catch up recently in some classes, especially maths and chem. I almost never have to worry about my grades or my academic abilities until now. The lessons are too difficult to understand, the teachers talk too fast and they seem to ignore me when i say that i don't get it. Probably because there are some other students in my class that are so much better than me and they can always answer the questions somehow. I have good marks at the beginning of the terms, but it has been going downhill since then.I did fucking terrible on the chemistry exam today. I studied so hard the night before but i just can't do it. I feel so disappointed in myself when everyone in class was exchanging answers and i cant do that because i cant even figure out anything. I just cried my ass out because i can't stop thinking about my grades. I can't talk about this with anyone, cause i talked to my parents and they just keep on blaming me. I can't talk to my friends either, because all of them are basically good at everything, they took that test and they did great so I don't want to drag them down. Now I want to end my life here. I don't want to deal with any problems in my life anymore. I don't want to deal with my parents' expectations, the pressure they put on me to get into a good university and get a scholarship anymore. It's too overwhelming. I don't want to feel embarrassed when my friends know about my grades. I fucking hate my life. Why am I so pathetic? School is hell to me now.

I want to die so I can end the suffering and so I don't have to face the truth that I can't actually live life. I know that life can be good but that just hurts me more because I can see the light yet I'm seperated from it in my own darkness. EDIT: I'll explain some more about my situation. I got lots of problems: I'm an addict, I feel depersonalised, derealised, mood swings, confused, very depressed an anxious, lots of physical pain.

"Ive never used reddit, so if my speech aint up to snuff then I apologize. This is going to be some ego-ridden drivel, and since I dont want to tell anybody I know about it, I figure this is a decent place to vent.Ive been dealing with depression for a long time. I try to put reason behind it, but Im convinced that I am only making a problem for myself because I have nothing else. I lived as much of a straightforward simple suburban life as you could imagine. I have two parents and a sister that love me, my schooling (up to now) has been fine, and I never had any real burden and struggle. My parents are fairly wealthy, and Im at a great university. I know people who experience, see, and do much worse than me, but I still feel tormented. I try to put blame on society, on the people around me, on my friends and my family, and I feel like this destructive torrent that was started for no reason and is doing damage for no reason. I know that the only thing inhibiting me is me, and the solution is to just get over my sad self pitying mood, but I cant.I overthink everything to the point of accepting that nothing matters. My dream (god I hate saying that) is to be a musician, and in the back of my mind I feel as though its something I can do. But then I just think longer and realize that even if I do reach the levels of fame that I want, Im still going to be this self destructive mess that cant find joy in anything.If youve read up to this point and are struggling to see what the problem is, as you have to work graveyard shifts to feed your starving kids, as you have to fiend coins in a cup to get another gram, as you face your partner and tell them you dont love them anymore, then you are right where Im at.Im too weak to commit suicide, I want to leave my dorm at 3:00 in the morning and smoke cigarettes in my bare feet and punch the sidewalk, but I know that I would just wake up the next day with a cold and broken knuckles. I feel helpless, that no matter what, things will carry on. I see no path. My only plan is to get dragged along until things get bad enough to where suicide looks more viable.Im such a piece of shit.If youve read up to here, thanks for lending an ear.","1"
"It's weird, but I always wanted to be different, special or really good at something. I grew up with many hobbies, but at all of them I was always just 'mediocre'. I am alright at many things but not good at one particular thing. I don't have any defining qualities or traits that make me stand out compared to others.I'm realizing more and more that I'm not different, I'm just a boring human. I want to write poems, draw amazing art, but I can't do either. I just feel like a blank sheet of paper. ","1"

"The suicide hotline number seems like the first thing youre directed to when youre suicidal. I have no friends or family to talk to, and I was so desperate I finally decided to call the hotline even though Im terrified of phone calls. I probably called and panicked and ended it before it connected at least 20 times because I was so anxious. When I finally got the courage to stay and it connected, I said I wanted to kill myself and the operator told me I should calm down and call another time. Isnt it her job to help me calm down? How could I call another time if Ill be dead? I was so disappointed I just ended the call. It was probably 3 minutes long at most and I wasnt able to get anything off my chest. I feel even worse. Ive been thinking about this for a very long time and not even the main resource for suicidal people could help me. I dont want to try to call again, it was hard enough to call the first time. Im so hopelessEdit: Thanks for the support. Im sorry to everyone who also had bad experiences but I hope this doesnt discourage anyone who wants to reach out from calling. This is just my experience, Ive heard some people have had good experiences with the suicide hotline. Dont give up..","1"

"The topic about kpop came up and she proudly said unlike me, she did not like any kpop artist at all. Implying that liking artists/celebrities are a bad thing. She proceeded to say something about our religion. Then I said, its a hobby, so all hobbies are bad then? She said Im her family, so she wants me to go to heaven. I replied, As if youre a God. Then she proceeded to say more things about our religion, something along the lines of, Lives is short. You dont think about death at all. I just replied You have no idea whats going on inside my brain and walked away from her.So I went from not having any depressive episodes at all from the past few days to wanting to kill myself in a second after she said that. Whats made me even more annoyed and disappointed is that she knows I have mental illness, that is social anxiety, and I thought she might have known that I might have depression also because she talks about her friend that has depression. I thought she understands a little bit since she did recommend me to go to a psychiatrist, even though she said it non-chalantly. Then a horrible realization finally hits me: no one understands me. I thought at least my sister understand, even just a little bit. One of these days, I will have the guts to kill myself and when I do, Im gonna leave a suicide note to my sister just so that she can have that on her conscience for the rest of her life.","1"

"I have been diagnosed with depression 6 weeks ago (been depressed most of my life though), referred to counseling which is full so I'm on a waiting list at the moment and given 20mg Fluoxetine daily.

I am now anxious about going back to work as I'll have to explain to everyone what happened. At A&E I was told to try breathing exercises and see my GP. My GP was actually great. She put me on propranolol and upped my Fluoxetine. But she also noticed some fresh SH wounds. I'm a mess at this point. I don't want to get out of bed and all I do is cry.

Now I feel like theres something more than depression thats fucking me up, its affecting my sleep, my work, my relationship with my family and especially my relationship with my boyfriend. I want to ring the doctors so bad, but I cant. Everytime I get the number up on my phone I dont end up ringing, I feel like my doctor is against me, when Ive been in the past I feel like she doesnt really care and just gave me pills to get rid of me.

"Ive had depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts for 8 years straight now, in varying degrees of intensity. If youre in this subreddit, chances are you can relate, and those things alone probably dont warrant much sympathy. But I dont need sympathy. Right now I just need an outlet, since currently I have none. It doesnt matter if anyone actually takes the time to read this, but if you do, just be prepared for a lot of rambling...Im on medication and have gone to therapy for the vast majority of the past eight years. But at the beginning of October, I started a new job with extremely long hours, leaving me no time to see my therapist. The last time Ive even spoken with her was probably mid-september. And since then, its been a slow and steady decline from moderate, normal depression and suicidal thoughts, to absolute fucking torture 24/7. Before I get into the main bulk of the story I need to get out of my system, I should give some background. It has been two and a half years since my last relationship. That means in two and a half years, Ive had no dates, no sex, not even a kiss or a one night stand. Its been endless, soul-destroying loneliness. And to top it off, Im practically a nympho since sex is pretty much the only thing that is guaranteed to make me at least a little happy for a short period of time, so no sex or physical contact in two and a half years is tearing me the fuck apart. I also, unsurprisingly, have extremely low self esteem. I fucking hate myself. I hate how I act, I hate how I look, I hate everything that I ever do or say. Needless to say, this characteristic is not the most helpful when attempting to pick up girls.Okay I dont know what the fuck Im trying to say here. I dont even know if its worth typing all this out. Basically, even though I know I really need to work on myself before I try dating someone again, I desperately crave a relationship with physical and emotional intimacy. Moving on. At work, theres a coworker of mine, lets call her Sarah. Weve basically spent the last two months together, in the same room for hours and hours on end, so weve gotten to know each other extremely well and are very close. I have basically no close friends, so this is kind of huge. On top of that, she is kind of an incredible person. She and I are alike in a scary number of ways, we have the same sense of humor, the same life philosophies, the same kinds of ideas. She is also unbelievably attractive, like, way out of my league. Its a wonder were even friends in the first place. Now after the first two or three weeks of spending solid time with Sarah, I was already kind of falling for her. However, she had a boyfriend of two years, and they were EXTREMELY serious. Like, talking about moving in together, marriage, kids, the whole shebang. Their families were already practically intertwined. Even though I was already crushing on Sarah, this was actually great for me. I had solidified in my mind - she is taken, shes never going to leave this guy, give up on the romantic ideations.And I kind of did. I let go of my romantic feelings and we continued to be very close friends. Then, over thanksgiving, she and her boyfriend broke up. It was a catastrophe. I helped Sarah through it, gave her advice, tried to be the best friend I could for her. And apparently, I was partially the reason for the break up. I had pointed out how much she had been doing for him, and she started to realize that what she was putting in wasnt really worth what she was getting out. Well, as soon as the breakup happened, my feelings started to form again. And much stronger this time. I could truly see us spending a life together, it seems that good. But lets list the reasons why this will never happen, shall we?:&nbsp;1. Shes out of my league. Though she seems to like my personality well enough, I am not nearly attractive enough for her. Her ex was a beefy guy with a beard - Im a scrawny nerd. 2. Her relationship just ended. Even if I wanted to pursue something, she just ended an extremely long term relationship. Not only would it be rude and insensitive to make any moves right now, but it would just be plain stupid. 3. We work together. This gig is scheduled to continue for a minimum of two more years. Dating a coworker is a bad enough idea, and if we got together and broke up, wed have to deal with the extreme discomfort of having to finish this two year project together. 4. The age difference. She is 3 years older than me. While not that big of a deal (hell, my aunt is ten years older than my uncle), I have a suspicion that she kind of perceives me as lesser, or like a little brother type. Its hard to be sure, but I have a feeling that the thought of actually being in a relationship with me has never even crossed her mind. 5. The friend zone. If I go for it, and she says no (as she VERY likely will), chances are that this great friendship that Ive built with her will wither and die. Neither of us wants that, and she may even use that as a reason why we should date in the first place - to save the friendship. 6. She deserves WAY better than me. Sarah is an incredible person. I am a clusterfuck of a human being, with major mental health issues (clearly) and Crohns disease on top of it all. She deserves someone way, way better than me. And better than her ex too, since he wasnt really up to par either. &nbsp;So, I have no idea what to fucking do. The obvious answer would be, dont try anything. But I cant stop thinking about her. We have such a strong connection, unlike nearly any other friendship Ive had. And now that there is technically hope and she is officially single, its driving me fucking insane. I know she would probably turn me down for a multitude of reasons, some of which I just listed, but I feel like I have to know. If circumstances were different - if we werent coworkers, if there wasnt as much to lose - would she give me a chance? Or would it be a no in any situation? The uncertainty is making me insane. Im pretty sure I have BPD, though Im technically undiagnosed. But this all feels like a classic ultra-attachment to someone, and everything Im feeling is amplified by 1000. I desperately want to cry, and yet I cant even do that. So maybe, if this is all BPD, this isnt even real. But everything Im feeling from this situation - the anxiety, the depression, the uncertainty, the self loathing - it is all just too much, and I have pretty much nonstop wanted to kill myself for the past several days. Suicidal thoughts were already pretty common in my normal depression, but this is much worse than normal. Ive definitely had episodes like this before, but god damn it sucks. I can hardly function at work. Shes been asking whats wrong, and Im just being vague and saying theres some shit going on in my personal life. I just need to die. Side note: this isnt an emergency post. Though my suicidal thoughts are extreme, I will never take action again. I did once, and after seeing what it did to my parents, I cannot in good conscience do anything like that again. But on the other hand, if I died from some health issue or accident out of my control, Id welcome it with open fucking arms. Shit like this for the past eight years has been fucking exhausting. Im just so done. On top of it all, all of this stress and anxiety is giving me a gnarly Crohns flare-up, so I get to feel extra shitty just for fun. I have to play that off at work too. Anyway, I dont know what Im doing here at all. Thats the gist of it. I feel like shit and I dont know what to do. And to clarify, I have been doing everything in my power these past eight years to get better, especially recently. Im constantly trying to alter my destructive and deluded thought patterns, and Im really working on liking myself and bettering my health. Ive tried so many things (and continue to), but even with all of the effort, I still feel hopeless. I really dont think I can get better. I am way too fucked up, and I have tried way too many things to no avail. Honestly once my parents both pass (which, for their sake I hope is not anytime soon), I will finally be able to just die in peace. I constantly yearn for that day. I also have no idea how Ive even functioned still with this severe level of depression and anxiety. I think Im really just keeping going in that regard for my parents as well - make them think Im doing just fine so they dont freak out even more and can live happily. Im also of the mindset that well, if Im stuck here, I might as well make an effort to succeed at things and attempt to make life a little less miserable in the meantime.Alright, Im rambling here. Like I said I would. If any of you actually read all that....may I ask why? Im sorry to have wasted your time. And best of luck to everyone else out there dealing with similar things. I know it sucks, and I wish every single one of you the best. Hang in there, and Ill try to do the same myself. TL;DR - Feel like shit, want to die, blah blah blah. ","1"
"I realize that this is speaking from the mind of somebody who is ""mentally ill"", but it baffles me how any sane person can honestly look around and think ""hey, life is awesome!!""   What's so awesome about toiling away the best years of your life going to school, before finally ""growing up"" into adulthood so you can attach yourself to a career and toil away to make some millionaire even richer, while you get poorer, for the rest of your life?How can anybody spend more than a few hours with other people and honestly say ""I trust people. People are good!""     I just don't see it, nor do i trust other people. Furthermore, how can people have the energy to go through the motions of mundane life while tending to the inane chatter from others...without getting absolutely exhausted and fed up?   How do people keep up the act of pretending to care about others while they are scheming to fuck them over?I see these things from the side and part of me is happy that I  want to liberate myself from the toxicity of it all, but the other half of me feels so fucking lonely!  How can we possibly pretend we are a cohesive unit known as ""society"" when there is so much suffering and inequality going on?  The two people that just honked their car horns at each other while violently shaking their fists and uttering horrible words at each other because THEY are in a rush and THEIR time is more important, are probably the same two assholes who've decorated their houses with Christmas lights.I ask....WHY?   What's the point of it all?  If the economy crumbled tomorrow, I'd be fucking scared to death of these people. Why?  Because we're humans, and we're fucking barbarians. You're not suddenly good people just because you put a wreath on your door and plastic candy canes on your lawn......yet most other people can just see past this, and ""mesh"" into society perfectly well. They acknowledge and accept life's flaws, find their place in society, and then move on.

"Hey Reddit,I'm not exactly in the best place. I lack perspective in my life right now on a level even I haven't experienced so far.You know, as for many in this sub, my life never exactly felt easy. I write 'felt' on purpose here. I'm aware that the problem here is by myself. You know, I never exactly knew what to do with my life, I'm a good example for this gen-Y-nihilism. I have no perspective, no clue how to move on. I was bullied half my life and wasn't in the best situation afterwards as well. I recently finished my country's equivalent to high school. Afterwards, I wanted to fullfill myself a dream and travel Australia for a year. I saved some money and bought a plane ticket. I went to Australia and failed, I did dump things and didn't get jobs was fired from one which was my last chance before I had to fly home, ... So in the end I had to fly back home and now I'm here, have no job, no money to at least do stuff with my friends (who obviously made fun of me failing in Australia, some of them have been there as well, so I feel like shit).I don't know what I should study at college now, or, rather which Job I want to do afterward so I will probably just study something that seems interesting but will end up in a stupid job afterward after all. And even if I do go to college I have to wait for winter term 2018. So right now, I'm all alone with my misery. I know the best solution would be to find a job but I just... I don't know.  It feels like I'm just not capable of achieving anything right now. I'm just laying in bed all day, my hobbies, for which I would have more than enough time right now aren't fun anymore... I feel like a failure. I start feeling broken, even.To be honest, I felt similar during middle and high school, but at that time I was like 'Welp, this sucks, but once I'm done with school I'll go backpacking and my life will get better and I'll have time to sort things out.

"Hey. Im in pretty hopeless depression since mid-2016.Is there anyone who i could talk with here? I don't even need to talk about my problems. Just talking to someone.","1"
"Hey, folks.So... I typically don't like to brag, but it's relevant here.  I've been pretty lucky all throughout my life.  My family situation is solid, I'm healthy (physically), and I've been lucky enough to be blessed with a number of talents.  In general I'm used to being able to pick things up quickly, whether it's a new concept in school, a new recreational activity, or a new topic I'd like to learn more about.  As you might imagine, I therefore tend to shy away from things that I don't understand, and for the most part that's okay.Now for the depression bit.  I'm unofficially (meaning, everything short of a doctor's signature on the paper) diagnosed with Aspergers' (I know it's not officially a thing anymore, but you know what I mean), but other than that, I've never paid much attention to my mental health, because much like my physical health, I didn't have any reason to worry and therefore I assumed that, for the most part, I was doing just fine.  Even if something came up that I didn't really understand, I would ignore it if it didn't seem like a big enough deal.Unfortunately, some things have come up recently that have been steadily worrying me, and I've been noticing some signs that I know are often related to depression.  But, depression is new territory for me (and as mentioned before, I tend to shy away from these sorts of things). So, once again, I ignored it for the most part, and chalked those feelings up to stress and lack of motivation due to college applications.That all changed when I played through the game Doki Doki Literature Club.For those of you that haven't played the game, it's a visual novel that is, for the most part, a dating simulator.  However, it touches on some of the darker aspects of the psyche as well, including a segment where one character struggles with depression and the player character has to decide how they want to handle it.  I, being the research machine that I am, was googling things about the game and happened to come across some discussions about the depression sections and how people thought they were for the most part realistic (albeit maybe a little exaggerated for gameplay effect).But, naturally, I paid it no mind.Today (not two hours ago, in fact), some things happened that caused everything to essentially come crashing down on me.  The event itself was relatively minor, in fact if I mention it you'll probably laugh, but in short what happened is I lost my crutch.  There was a certain thing that I had been spending more and more time on as my symptoms got worse and worse.  I just figured that I was getting more and more into that activity, but in truth, I was retreating further and further away from my problems.Now that this crutch is gone, I'm forced to face the monster inside of me, and I really don't know what to do.  Suddenly that one sequence from DDLC is hitting home in all the wrong ways, and I'm scared and panicking because I don't know how to even begin handling all this.So this brings me to my request for help.  I need help learning how to manage this, how to recognize the symptoms sooner, how to mitigate the effects it has had and likely will continue to have on my life and my mental well-being, really anything.  Aside from some cursory research on symptoms and the stuff they tell you at school in those yearly counselor introductions, I know absolutely nothing about depression, and as one might expect from reading what I've said, that scares me.Any and all help is appreciated, even if it's just helping me talk through some of the stuff I'm feeling right now.Thanks for reading.","1"

"There are these days when you really can't get out of bed. Then days when you just feel so alone, like how a thought pops in your head like ""Oh do you believe that the fire in the news was stage"" then remember that, oh you don't have anyone to share your thoughts with. Or just those days when you feel so alone and you try to open up but instead of letting you, people focus more on defending themselves and insisting that ""No we're always here for you and we're not leaving you  "" but you never feel it. Some days you're just tired of seeing the worst in everything. Im tired of being mad at all the unseen messages and unreciprocated efforts. Some days you're just mad that ""how come I get to be there for you but I really need someone right now but where are you"" Those days that you just get so tired of being left behind, but there's the guilt creeping in that ""I think I'm the toxic one. It is my fault for sounding so demanding and dependent."" I feel toxic sometimes. Or maybe I deserve what Im feeling right now","1"
"I shouldn't be in the position I am right now. College finals are around the corner, and I'm probably gonna have to drop out. I shouldn't have to. I've been given almost every opportunity imaginable to not be a complete fuck up. I was given a tuition free ride to the University of my dreams. I have someone nice enough to sponsor me so I could live on campus. And my parents offered to buy my books. It is literally the situation that most college students dream about. Yet somehow I still fucked everything up. All I needed to do was keep a B average, with no grades below a C. I still fucked it up. My future was literally handed to me on a silver fucking platter, and I still managed to fuck it up. I don't know how I'm supposed to live with myself. I don't know how the people who supported me can live with me. I wish I could kill myself, but I know if I did, there would be others who would as well. Looks like I'm gonna end up like a worthless piece of shit.","1"

I've given up trying a lot. I try to do theater but I never get cast for anything recently. And for forensics I constantly get last in everything. I'm not good at any classes and I'm fucking talentless. What's there even to do. Everyday is the same and the only change is it only gets worse every day. I'm running out of ways to cope cuz theater is making me feel even worse about myself somehow. I refuse to tell my parents to get medication or therapy because I don't want to know how they'll react. I need fucking help with the downward spiral that is my life. . . ","1"
"I am a male student in my 20's.I'm sorry in advance if this breaks any rules, I read them and I don't think it does. I just want advice on how to talk to the doctor and what to say.I'm going to the doctor because I just feel like I need to now, I've been having trouble for a while now since I was 19. My parents had split up and I thought I was too mature to be upset about it so I tried not to let myself and that's been a habit of mine ever since tbh. By trouble I mean a few things, I get very anxious over some very basic things, my social life suffers for it and so does my love life. I find it very difficult to trust anyone so I rarely allow myself to open up to anyone or be close to them. I can never lay down to sleep, I just stay up in bed reading Reddit threads (so much that if I look during the day it's boring because I saw it all last night/early that morning) and feeling down about everything. If I'm not reading a thread I'm just thinking about my life and feeling crappy about it.A few days ago would've been the 5th anniversary of me and my ex had we not broken up, I don't miss her as that relationship became kinda toxic. But I miss the way I felt 5 years ago, I wasn't worried about anything, I was just happy. So I decided that I need to see a doctor or talk to someone about how I feel about life now. How do I talk to a doctor about this? I've never been to them for this because of anxiety and I don't like to self diagnose because I see posts on Tumblr from people who do it for attention and it just seems disrespectful. Because of that I've never talked to a doctor about it because I felt other people had it worse, but recently my social life has just died, my motivation is gone, I can't find entertainment or excitement in anything anymore and just feel down by default. It's hard to describe but it just feels worse than it has before and I want it to stop. I have a good life but just feel like my happiness is outweighed by my sadness, loneliness, anxiety and emptyness.Sorry this is longer than I intended it to be, what I wanted to ask is how do I talk to the doctor tomorrow, I can't imagine just sitting down and saying I have depression and getting some magic pill for it. This is making me so anxious and I just don't know how to talk about it. So what do I say? Any advice from people who had similar feelings about getting help would be appreciated. Thank you for reading and sorry it was so long.","1"

"I am a teenager in highschool and I started feeling depressed about 5 years ago. I was always ridiculed, singled out and was never accepted into friend circles. I always felt so alone until about the second half of eighth grade when I started hanging out with people who I actually felt comfortable around.            It wasn't until about 5-6 months ago when I fell for a girl. I loved everything about her. She had an amazing personality, a great sense of humor, and her smile would make me happier than I ever could have imagined. I always told myself to never ask her out, I thought that if I did I would creep her out or she would never talk to me again.            One night I felt that the pain was too much to bear. I started writing some random shit onto a piece of paper. ( just a letter from me to me talking about how I felt) In a sudden turn of events I pulled courage out of my ass and signed the paper with my name and number with a message along the lines of just text me a yes or no. The next day I gave it to her.           I gave it to her in the morning and asked her to read it after school that day. That day was the longest fucking day of my life. I had a band festival at UNLV on the same day and I left the concert at around 7:30. When I left I had not received a text from her. I was so anxious I lashed out at my mom, who made me walk home after getting quite a few miles from UNLV. I had just sat on the side of Craig Rd. For about 2 hours stewing in self hatred.            Just when I lost all hope and started plotting my own demise, I get a notification. It was a long text that said something along the lines of ""hey it's XXXXXX, Sorry I took so long to respond I had to think for a while. I really liked your letter. I feel like the answer is more complicated than a yes or no..."" I wiped the tears off of my face and cried some more when I read that text. We spent the rest of the night texting each other. It was the 2nd best night of my life.           About 3 months ago she formally asked me if we wanted to start a relationship. I of course said yes. We we're together for about a month, until she told me that she didn't feel the same way I watched my heart break as I stood there smiling. (what I typically do when I feel depressed) It was very big news to me and I kept to myself for a while.            Even though that was a long time ago I still remember that as if it were yesterday. Today more than ever, do I feel affected by what happened then. I have asked my parents for counseling more than once but they pretend like I never said anything, and they continue to assume that I am ok. I'm not okay, and I haven't been okay in 5 years. I guess I hide it too well for anyone to notice.","1"

"Long story short, I've got deformations to the intestine that are made worse by IBS and an anxiety disorder. I'm legally disabled and I've been surviving on SSI and food stamps for a little over a year.After some surgeries and heavy medication, I got a little cocky and felt like I could probably go back to work. So, I found a part time job to start out, thinking the load would be pretty light.It turns out I work less days each week, but I still work eight hour shifts. I used to work 12 hour days, so I thought ""how bad could it be?""The worst. On hour 4, I started getting weak. Hour 5, I started shaking and sweating. Hour 6, splitting headache, nausea. And then by hour 7 the nausea was so bad that I threw up during the last 30 minutes of my first day. Then the last 30 minutes were spent slumped over a table, profusely sweating and trying not to vomit. Some of the worst pain I've ever felt in my life, all together.Now I'm stuck. I don't know if I should go back to being the worthless leech on society that I was, torture myself by working like this (and just end up getting fired because it isn't working), or ask for shorter shifts on more days (which it doesn't seem like they even do). Either way, I'm still screwed because this killed my confidence about going back to work and leading a semi-normal life.Day one and I'm already defeated. Now I have to go back in the morning and I only got done throwing up an hour ago. Still weak and shaking too.God dammit.","1"

"I used to be fairly normal, maybe a little on the edgy side but normal. I had a decently sized friend group and I enjoyed joking around and talking to all of them and even though I sometimes felt sad it was bearable. There was someone very special to me in my friend group, her name was Valentine and she was special to and it was a mutual feeling, it's like we were made for each other. We were best friends and she talked about our future and how great it would be. One day I made the decision to homeschool, i started being a dick for no reason and burned bridges and broke promises I made to her but I thought I was hilarious and my ego was super inflated. As the year went on my mental state and grades suffered greatly, I felt lonely and sad most of the time and lost motivation to do anything. This is my second year of homeschooling and I've never felt more broken, I'm going to try to move in with my dad and have a clean slate. I'm just extremely worried about my social skills and if I'll ever meet someone like Valentine again. The worst part about all of it is that it's all my fault and I deserve everything that's happened to me. The guilt I experience and the loneliness and absolute self hatred for everything I threw away overtakes me every single day. Some days I go into anger tantrums when no one is home and just scream and other nights is a soft cowardly cry, it's honestly pathetic but idk what else to do.

"I've been struggling with depression for around 9 years and in the last 3 years it has gotten significantly worse. I've been having suicidal thoughts lately and I am finding it hard to find motivation for anything, and with myself currently in my second year of university it is affecting my studies. I have some friends but I feel like some of them are only there to use me as a tool. (Bumming drives off of me, use my stuff, etc.) I have finals coming up and I don't have the energy to study for them. Hell, I didn't even go to most of the classes either. I feel like a fucking idiot knowing that I'm wasting not only money but my opportunity to graduate and get a job after university. Best part is I'm not even sure if what I'm taking is what I want to do. I only took it because I needed to either go to school and get a degree or find a job. I didn't know what I wanted to do. I didn't tell anyone about how I've been feeling until this year because I felt like it was a taboo topic to talk about. The first person I told was one of my friends when opened up to me about his depression and I felt like there was somebody I could actually talk to about it without sounding like I'm crazy. The second was my mother. I didn't think that I would ever tell her that as I didn't think that she would be very accepting of it. Surprisingly, she was accepting of it and has booked me a doctors appointment. Although she really doesn't fully understand what I'm going through, she does realize that it's serious and is trying to help, and I am very thankful that she is. Hopefully I can get some form of treatment and be able to function properly. Even if I'm having these suicidal thoughts, I don't really feel like I should end my life. I'm hoping there's something more to my life then feeling like this everyday. My sleeping schedule lately has been very off what it normally is, and as I'm struggling through the night I thought making this post would make myself feel a little better as I don't have anyone to talk to. If anyone read this then thanks for reading and sorry it was so long. I just felt like typing out the first things that popped into my head.","1"

"Lately I've been thinking about the feelings attached to terms like Happiness and Joy. I tried thinking of when the last time I was happy and I nearly threw up, and while I'm not going to sit here and pretend its not because I'm not used to being happy. Because that's exactly what it is, to me (and I'm sure many of you) those feelings are foreign like a stomach virus is to the body and its true you can train yourself through shutting down negative thoughts and replacing them with positive ones its not something I really want to do.For the record I don't define myself as being depressed. I am a depressed person but its not something I would put on a sheet if I were a character in a tabletop game. I guess what I'm getting at here is that I don't want to be an emotion, even a good one. It's better if I just think of myself as me and deal with the pain as it comes, I'm still sad sack of shit but at least I'm not just a sad sack of shit like everyone thinks I am.Just some thoughts I wanted to get out in the open take it how you will.","1"

"TW: suicide, rape, depression, hurt .....I've felt like shit for the last two weeks and just today in trying to vent about shit These are really out of order sorry about that (but I'll sort them by kid - teenager adult)  (I'm 19 now) Kid When i was a kid I hung out with this older kid (he was in 5th grade) one time he came over unexpectedly and we were alone and he started saying weird things like ""wanna touch my penis"" and ""if you tell anyone I'm here I'll leave"" and I got scared he didn't wanna be my friend anymore so I did.. I saw my dad have a heart attack, I was just a little kid and my dad came in so I went to see him but he was all sweaty and stumbling around and then he fell forward on to his bed (he survived thank God) Home life in general has always been bad (my parents don't love each other, I'm not going to make myself feel better by telling myself they do anymore because it's obvious they don't) they constantly fight and neither of them have jobs so we usually don't have that much food (I have a job now so it's not as bad) One time my sister and I were walking home from school and got hit by a car. I pushed her out of the way (thank God) and ended up with a broken wrist and broken ankle) Pre teen I was bullied a lot in school for my fashion sense, having taped up glasses, etc. I really didn't have any friends either. So I started lashing out online and I said some fucking terrible things, shit I can't believe I said to this day And from there things escalated into real life, I had knives pulled on me, attacked at a talent show, the principal straight up said to me ""they're just getting back at you for what you said"" and the school resource officer said if things continued they'd give me a criminal record (this all happened over ages 12-13-14) Then at the end of the year I got taken away from my parents and put into a foster home (they separated me from my siblings so I was just alone) I ended up in a group where everyone was considerably older (not adults but older than I was) and there was a lot of sexual tension between people there which stressed me out and made me feel inferior. Not to mention that we only got maybe an hour outside (when the supervision decided it was ok, so not even everyday) and all our downtime was spent in a small lounge watching TVI finally got out of there after 8 months and into a foster home. It started out great!! They let me use their laptop and everything. But then they let a relative take off with the laptop (oh well what can you do). I just played outside that was ok. But my foster mom made fun of me for my incontinence issues (even fucking pulled my pants down once and asked ""did you shit yourself?"") Also I flap my hands a lot for stimulation and she'd get angry at me for doing that. TeenagerI got out of the foster home and things just kinda got stagnant up until high school, that's when I started to feel depressed and shitty all the time -i finnally ended up in inpatient and I thought everything was going to be ok when I got home. Lol nope. I'd either get sent home everyday or I'd just stay home. They wanted to put me back in inpatient but I said no because my parents got mad whenever they got a call from the school saying I had to go to the trauma centerI eventually dropped out (it was a Voc-Tech school) and got put into another school (I dropped out for good after being here for a year and getting into fights a lot) I started doing drugs. Started with pot but then I found out certain anxiety and pain meds can get you high. I felt awesome all the time and even found a girl!! Everything seemed ok. Not ideal but ok. Eventually things with the girl got fucked up and culminated in us meeting (her mom didn't like me and it was obvious). It didn't go good at all. Whatever. (I honestly had no idea what to do and I didn't want to have sex) After the sleep over, things just went off the rails, and since in a fucked up way I viewed her as a ""Ray of light"" in my life I took a shit ton of Xanax and ended up in the hospital. First thing I did when I woke up was message her and tell her what happened... And she started telling me that it's all my fault, suicide is cowardly, etc. I had a meltdown in the hospital but calmed down eventually and went to inpatient again (spent Christmas there) Once I got home I messaged her (lol massive fucking mistake) and told her I missed her and thought about her etc. Her response? ""My friend bought me a vibrator for Christmas"" and then showed me pics. I can't even explain how hurt I felt. In retrospect I should have seen it coming (also my mindset was ""BUT YOU'RE WITH ME"", entitlement etc. Regret it) but it fucked me up. I spent the next few weeks agonizing over this, culminating in me pouring my heart out to her one night. She screen capped my messages and sent them to her friends then showed me their reactions. They said shit like ""he's so pathetic"" etc. At this point I was hurt enough already this barely phased me. Then one night she was really high and called me and asked if I wanted to see her masturbating... I said no but she still sent me a video of her using her using her vibrator with the friend that bought it for her over Skype. That... Broke me, I don't trust anyone sexually anymore, sex is one of my biggest insecurities. But for some fucking reason I still talked to her after that, I'd say stuff like ""I wanna get plugs and dye my hair black"" and she'd be like ""no that'd look ugly on you lol"", like ok. Fine. I eventually got rid of her. So I made a new friend. He was cool. We smoked weed together n shit. Eventually he started showing interest in me, and I was interested in him.  One night things kinda escalated, we were smoking pot in my room and he kept saying ""hey Chris come here"" so eventually I did. We kissed. Ok. I was ok with it. Maybe I wasn't idfk I was high as shit. It escalated to him jerking me off (I didn't want to but I didn't want him to be mad either) and then I did the same thing to him. I kinda just didn't think about that (and really haven't until I told my counselor recently) and whateverBack to more on that girl  Flash forward up to about two months ago (the entire first part with her happened back in 2015) I messaged her to check up, I figured it would be ok, it'd been a long time after all So we talked. She was acting sexual and saying  really sexual things and said she wanted to see me but to bring cigarette money. I did. I walked like 4 miles and we met up. She took the cigarette money and walked away. I was like ok. So I walked home and attempted suicide again (no one knows about this hehe) but would you look at that I woke up in the morning. Ok. Things have just been shit ever since then, I'm having trouble trusting people, my sexual insecurities are always bubbling just below my surface, and I don't have any friends around here.

"I have been diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder. The latest diagnosis is with Psychotic features.I have been on something like 7 different medications and all of them have had big side effects and/or been ineffectual to dealing with my issues.I have hope every time that THIS will be the one that helps me.I have lost nearly all hope, as this takes heaps of time and I am really, really behind in life (broke, without a career, wife or house at 32) and don't want to keep dealing with this.","1"
"I fucked up..again..and this time for real.For most of the time I went to school I always had to force myself.Eventually when I couldnt handle it anymore I had dropped out and actually didnt do anything worth mentioning in that time.After a bad breakup earlier this year I decided I couldnt keep living like this and that I had to make a change,(after the usual I hate myself thoughts subsided and I actually found some motivation), and enrolled in a class to get my degree so I could start living my life...But guess what? After the first day of school and everyone actually being nice, I just couldnt bring myself to go there anymore..its just like something telling me over and over to not go there..I always went to the doctor and got sick leave but last week the school called and told me I missed too much of the year and that I couldnt finish it like that.So here I am, lost another chance to get a better life because Im such an idiot..Its always the same and I feel like it will never change.I dont know what to do and even though my boyfriend is there for me I still feel like it would be better if it wasnt the case so I could just end it in peace..","1"
"They said, ""You're not depressed."" ""Stop talking nonsense.""And they saw my cuts a few months ago.They said I can't be depressed because I never experienced to become financially unstable, because I have a nice home and I get to eat anything.I feel so invalidated, like there's a requirement to be depressed.Just because I don't suffer as much as what they suffered financially before doesn't make me have no right to be depressed. If I'm dead, I don't want to hear them say, ""We didn't know she was depressed.""","1"

When will people acknowledge that depression is an illness not a temporary state of mind?The boundary of feeling sad and being depressed is not that big, but there's still a significant amount of difference. The biggest being, that the illness is not natural and most of the time won't heal with time. Unlike the problems stated. /rant over","1"
"I used to be more emotional, but these days all I think about is whether fighting for my life is even worth it.There's no fear or hesitation. It feels like I have uncureable disease in my body that never goes away. Pain in my stomach sweating from stress and constant vertigo. People BS me about how I always have hopes in the future, but that's as unrealistic as stating god exists and cares about each one of us. Noone ever saw god before, there's no proof that god ever helped us. I'm just tired. Tired of living. Tired of believing in hope that someday things will be better in which would likely never come.","1"

"I catch myself sometimes on the subway, at work etc.. Just looking at someone and not liking them. On edge, in my head telling myself ""let them say something to me"". My heart starts racing. And all I can do is zone out completely. Thinking about hurting them. Sometimes it's not that bad, but there's times (like yesterday) I vividly thought about choking some random woman and bashing her head. What bothers me the most is although my body was obviously under stress (the heart racing), whilst thinking about this I get a rush of endorphins. I literally have to snap myself out of it. I would never NEVER EVER hurt someone, but daydreaming about it releases soo much energy.","1"
"I recently moved 30 miles away from my community college. No job, applied but no calls back. I'm using the rest of my savings on gas to attend a 45 minute lecture. Professor hates when I don't show up everyday, takes away my extra-credit & test-correction opportunities. I know she doesn't like me.Grades are dropping.I have no friends, no companion, no support system.Lots of chores. No one in this damn house helps. I have to cook, clean, unpack, bring all the furniture upstairs, etc. Has to be done before anyone gets home from work.Get reminded everyday of the car accident I was in two years ago. Brother complains of the high insurance. I'm in the process of being sued for that. None of my old friends check up on me, not even my dad. The last time I saw him was on my 18th birthday to cancel child support. Two birthdays later and I still haven't heard from him. He talks to my brother, though. The only thing that upsets me the most is my education. I always loved school and I used to get good grades, but I don't have that passion anymore. I feel like my life problems won't allow me to focus on my studies. My life sucks.","1"
"Im writing this because I have nowhere else to go and no one else to talk to. I dont want to bother anyone and I dont want to sound like Im aimlessly complaining, but Im stuck with no clear way to get free. Ive been trying to find an apartment in another city for work and have been met with failure after failure, either because someone else takes the apartment before I can submit an application or because the person offering to let me see it just doesnt care enough to show up at the appointed time. Ive spent months trying to find something, anything, and each time it culminates in nothing but disappointment. Im trying my hardest, pushing myself to the absolute limits of my knowledge and ability and still it isnt enough. No matter what I do, it just isnt enough.To make matters worse, Im being barraged from all sides by criticism. My employers are bugging me to hurry up and move so I can get to work. My online job is pestering me to get all this straightened out so I can get back to work for them as well. And throughout it all is my family, saying there is no one to blame for this mess but myself. I cannot work any harder, but Im being treated like all Im doing is slacking off and treating my life like a joke. Every day Im the butt of some new mockery or the subject of some new shouting match. Every day, my family comes home and Im disappointed to see them again because all I can do is wonder what Im going to be in trouble for today.This in particular hurts because I have lived for a long time with pretty severe depression. It is resistant to both therapy and medication. I was also diagnosed with mild PTSD due to events I endured earlier in life, which makes it difficult for me to ""come out of my shell"" around other people. Ive made my peace with this and have informed my family of my situation. They dont care.They care when its other peoples mental health at stake. Just the other day, I had to sit at dinner and listen to my mother talk about her friend who has ADHD. She was nothing but sympathy and compassion, saying that her friends family should treat him gently because of the severity of his illness. But when her own son has issues, it's just because he is lazy and refuses to listen to other people. The hypocrisy alone is enough to send a person into a rage.Normally I would look outside my family for aid. Unfortunately, that wont work. Ive never had many friends and the few I managed to make over the course of my college life all graduated, moved back to their own lives halfway across the country, and subsequently forgot about me. I am painfully alone and no one is coming to help me from this situation.This is my life now. I havent had a good nights rest in months. Every night, I worry or cry myself to sleep. I can barely eat because feel sick to my stomach almost all the time. When no one is at home, I punch the walls or doors trying to alleviate some of this stress, again and again until my knuckles bleed. It doesnt work and no one cares. Im afraid Im reaching the end of my tether. Im afraid for myself because every day Im left alone in a house with easy access to a loaded gun. And every bad day that passes, that gun starts to look more and more inviting.I know that finding an apartment and a life of my own is my only path forward. But when Im shot down again and again and left with nothing but the rage, abuse, and condescension of quite literally everyone around me, it feels like Im stuck in some self-destructive cage with no way out. And if I cant find a way out, I feel like my only option is to remove myself from the equation.I need help.","1"
"Everyday I have suicidal thoughts. They scare the hell out of me knowing that it would crush my familys spirit to see me go like that.

Im very alone and all I have to cope with my depression is to sit at the computer and mindlessly look at social media and play video games. Ive been having to cope a lot recently and its getting worse by the day. Meaning Ive been skipping my classes, avoiding going to the dining hall to eat, or just going out in general. Im starting to feel that once the semester is over, I might end up pulling the trigger because of how disappointed my parents are for failing three classes I promised to do well in.

"i have struggled with clinical depression and chronic anxiety since i was eleven years old. i am a little over sixteen now, i have been very depressed since the third of november when my boyfriend broke up with me because he didnt love me anymore (he said if came and went and he couldnt keep lying to me anymore, but it had only been going on for a few weeks apparently?). it is now the 29th and he wont even look at me despite seeing him at school multiple times a day and having a study hall together on wednesdays. he doesnt know why it happened. we had never had a fight, he didnt find anyone else, and he said it was nothing i had done. it was so abrupt and nobody saw it coming and now i dont know what to do with myself. three days prior he has woken me up with a good morning text telling me i was the love of his life. i just dont want to find anyone else. and i dont want him to find anyone else. i had a 1.6 GPA my sophomore year and he helped me turn my life around and last week i got an 101% on my geometry test and have a B+ average. i finally felt like i was a functioning person. and now all of that has been ripped away. (and please no generic stuff about how high school relationships never last. we had been official for almost 8 months but had been a couple for over a year now and we had talked about our future extensively and i started making college plans around him.)i had posted about wanting the hurt to go away quite a lot last night on my private instagram only a few friends follow. two of them told the main office and i was kind-of-forcibly escorted out of the school because of my suicidal thoughts and they told me if i didnt leave with my mother they would call an ambulance and have police take me out of the school and to the childrens hospital, and then to whichever mental hospital they best felt suit me. the problem was, i didnt want to kill myself. sure i might have said i wanted to or was going to. but that really wasnt it at all. i have been on zoloft since september but im still struggling with depression, anxiety, and according to my therapist most likely OCD as well. they told me i didnt need to be placed in inpatient care (despite hurting myself), and i was only passively suicidal as i had never really formed a plan to kill myself. i had just thought about what it would be like to be dead. so alluding to all that i just mentioned. does anyone have any help with dealing with passive suicidal thoughts. i dont want to kill myself, i just feel like it would be okay if i went to sleep and never woke up again, or i have thoughts of just getting in my car, filling it with gas, and just driving and driving and driving until theres no more road left. i just feel like things would be better if i could just escape. like maybe i would hurt less. i dont know where im going with this. im just hoping theres absolutely anyone who reads this.

"I'm 19 and I still can't drive. Got the permit and practiced but failed twice and lost the motivation, or rather I channelled what limited motivation I had into more basic tasks like waking up every day.Never had any sort of job. Terrified of applying and interviewing.Horrible social anxiety that only gets better when my depression gets bad enough to numb it. I was out to eat recently with my family and the stress of ordering my food crushed my mood and my appetite. Like, Jesus fucking Christ, ordering a goddamn burrito?? Broke down and talked to my parent once, and got taken to see a doctor. Got a Zoloft prescription and saw an unhelpful therapist a few times before quitting. The stress of doctors got to me and I lied my way through it and said the pills were working fine. I never felt any different. Eventually saw a different doctor and got switched to Lexapro, but I did the same thing as before. The multiple check-ins drained me and I just wanted to suffer alone. As a young kid in school I was always told I was smart, one of the brightest, I could go far with my brain. But I'm so lazy, and tired. I nearly flunked senior year in highschool, I'm failing my first semester of college because I'm a laxy piece of shit who doesn't do their work, and definitely losing the scholarship that got me there. Gotta talk to my parent. I live with them but they don't know. Gotta tell them I'm quitting. Didn't know what I wanted to do anyway.I feel like I've failed both society's and my own expectations for myself, and I can never catch up, I fucked it all up.

"Hi everyone, 22 now. In a deep pit. Never finished highschool, had only 2 jobs and quit my last one after a month. Always hated school, was always a bad student. Never learned anything from my parents and have no siblings. No family either besides my dad who I live with and who pays the bills. I've taken steps to improve my life but to no avail. Been trying to finish highschool for a long time but I just can't bring myself to work hard. Never have been able to. Only thing I ever liked to do was play videogames.

Whenever I start working towards something it might go well for a few days then I fall on my face again. I've been incredibly depressed. My life is a joke, I find my thoughts getting darker and darker every day. And I lose hope every day. I just wish I was never born to be honest.

I now talk to one, maybe 2 people regularly now and even then Im scared that wont last. I have a small family who I struggle to talk to but I try to. I really hate being like this.

I just wish there was a way I can do what I enjoy, and support myself off it, without sitting around and feeling like a loser, which makes everything I do feel boring and wrong. And even though it's not necessarily very hard to go about life like everyone else in society, i just despise that idea so much, my only current plan is to wait until I don't have a choice anymore and have to courage to end my own life.I'm to a point where I don't want to leave depression, because it's the only thing that feels true and comforting anymore.

"My family is abusive. I usually hate the holidays because I become jealous of those with families that love them and sometimes I feel like, with all of the decorations and hype, that their happy status is ""shoved in my face."" I really only feel this way, however, when I feel like I'm alone. It's really easy to feel this way.This holiday season, know you're not alone, and this whole subreddit and my post is proof of that. Sometimes it's difficult to not feel alone, because not only am I depressed, but I'm depressed because I'm being abused. (although I'm not the only one, I just see more adults who are away from their abusive family - or maybe they didn't even have one - talk about their depression. My depression is environmental).It's easy to compare yourself to others in two ways: (1) see how disadvantaged you are by looking at how happy your peers and other folks are with their family (2) trying to minimize your situation by looking at how unfortunate others are compared to you, and trying to normalize or feel grateful for what you do have (like feeling thankful for having an abusive parent, because at least you have a parent or because at least sometimes they're nice, or etc.)Although you should definitely observe cues from other peoples' lives and realize that what is happening to you is wrong (so you don't grow up thinking you deserve what happens or normalize it), know it's all very adaptable: know, that you don't have to minimize your situation or minimize the holiday season to get through it. Enjoy it, because this is your life and no one can take it away from you. And remember, when you're older, you can have a family of your own and have the best fucking holidays ever. Another thing to note (kinda a vent of a personal fear of mine) is sometimes my family forces the holiday season, don't participate if you don't feel comfortable. It's hard but I've realized every time I go along with it, it predictably turns into a scene, and/or I just enable my abusers and minimize the shit they've done to me. It's okay to not want to be around the people that hurt you, even if you want to give them another chance, even if you want to try, you can wait till you're older and have more control over the situation. That's all. My heart and love and prayers go out to everyone struggling this holiday season, no matter what the issue. Have the best holiday you can possibly have because fuck depression and fuck abusive family - you deserve the best.","1"
"I dropped out of school when I was 11 and pretty much just sat at home jerking off and watching TV for 4 years. I kind of figured Id find myself along the way and go back to school or something and I did when I was 15 but dropped out pretty much immediately... because I couldnt be bothered. I made some friends, and I really liked them. I just dropped out and I havent talked to them since. Two other friends that Ive had since I was a toddler are going their own ways and Im sitting here friendless and with no place to go and make friends, not that I want them.

Times you suddenly seem mean to me for no big reason or don't try to fix things with me. Times I try to tell you how much you mean to me and you ignore me. Sometimes you make me feel really unimportant even if you don't mean to. I just explode when you do these things. I have to hold in my tears at school and act like some girl that lives on a different continent might not really be my friend, which is causing me to feel so miserable.Although you have upset me many times, I do believe you are a real friend when my thoughts are going less crazy and my mind has calmed down. I remember the times you would literally get MAD at me for not telling you why I was upset, and the times you said so many kind things about me, and times how you said you would love to see me in person and hug me. You live over 7,000 miles away from me yet you are the closest friend I have ever had. I would love to spend a day with you, give you a tour of the things to do in my city and just hang out with you.I am so sorry for the hurt I have caused. I want you back in my life so bad. I am explosive and clingy and sensitive and weak and all this shit makes me say some nasty things to the people I care most about. I wish you would believe I care about you, and not just creepily obsessed with you. I am clingy, but I don't have posters of your face on my wall and I don't want to be in a boyfriend-girlfriend relationship, and I don't want to marry you someday. I want you to just be my best friend again, or even just a casual friend. I want to see you some day, and hug you and tell you how you're like a sister to me at times, and if I start feeling sad I want to hug you and cry and keep you near me.Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck. I wish I could just stay calm when you hurt me. I wish you would understand how much I care about you. I wish your mom wouldn't tell me to kill myself. I wish you would know that I almost never mean the nasty things I say, and that you would understand how you hurt me but how I still care about you. Holy fucking shit what am I even saying anymore, I just want you back so bad.I hope you at least someday understand that I care about you, even if you decide you're done with me. I hope you understand the ways you hurt me, and maybe someday you will try to be my friend again and maybe someday we can meet in person and I can hug you and hang out with you and you can meet all my friends from around where I actually live. Or maybe I can visit you, and you take me around your city. I miss you.I am so sorry for the pain I have caused you. I am a little too clingy and insecure and depression isn't helping this friendship. I wish you were back in my life. Thanks for all the times you have been there. Sorry for the verbal vomit. I will always be here for you.","1"
"I've been getting worse and worse the last few weeks. I have been taking my meds every day (Citalopram 40mg once per day) and I can feel them working, but I feel like I'm having a breakdown at least once a day.I've been trying to find someone new to date and I feel like it's really contributing to my sadness. I feel worthless because the only person I've been able to find that has interest in me is blowing me off all of a sudden and it's making me feel very down about myself.I'm not suicidal but I'm starting to feel like if I just kinda didn't exist anymore that would be okay. If that makes sense.It just really stings to hear someone tell you they aren't going anywhere and then stop talking to you. I think I just really need some kind of reassurance right now that everything isn't falling apart.","1"

"From 12 to 22, I've changed. My idealism has been stripped away. I've noticed to the extent that relationships are transactional. That my overly empathetic nature is useless in self-serving society. There's not really such a thing as selfless love. I can't feel very much, probably as a result of my medication. All I can do is act and feign interest when I interact. And I have little desire to interact. It's become a very false thing to me. I feel no true loyalty to anyone.I hate myself for all the time I waste not doing anything. I enrolled in university halftime to give myself a mental break, but it just lead to laziness. These past months flew by as I overslept and overindulged in shows. I know I ought to be studying and making myself a more appealing job candidate. I know I should do these things for my future self (who I'm screwing). But I can't. I frequently just run away from reality via sleep or fall into portrayals of idealized worlds with infallible protagonists. There's nothing I really want here. When I manage to peel myself away from the screen, I'm sort of horrified by reality. As a teen, I used to at the very least keep up with things, read, enjoy learning. I wouldn't let myself fall behind even if I was alone. I was working towards one day having a fulfilling life. That hope. It's gone.I don't care anymore. Only recently I was able to whole-heartedly cry and realize my pain. I can't forgive myself for allowing myself to degrade this far. I'm afraid I can only sink lower. I know what I should do. Go outside, interact, work hard. But I can't slay my dragons. I have atrophied so far I can't even recognize myself. I'm a shell of who I was. And there's no way I'm leaning on anyone else for this. People don't really want to hear or deal with others' problems. People only care as much as it benefits them to. I'm sorry to say that. Maybe I'm a fool but that's what life taught me.I will fuck up my life if I continue down this path. It's not immediately recognizable, the damage one does when they live passively.So, co-miserate with me. Give me some tough love. Words of encouragement. ","1"
"It's fucking 1:36 in the dead of night and I'm far too sad, tired, and pained to sleep. I forgot to take my sleeping pill, of course, lol. My laptop is at 19% and I have 21 dollars to my name until tomorrow. My entire family is asleep upstairs and in the rooms around me, and here I am, staring at the wall, listening to Kat Dahlia, posting on Reddit again. This is a somewhat follow up to last week's post about how my job was getting worse and I'd been victim to a serious nervous breakdown. So far in the past week, my family, and everyone on here has been super supportive of me and taking care of myself. Sorry to those who DM'd me who I never responded too; it's not that I don't want to talk or anything, but right now with the holidays gearing up and me working a dead-end retail job I have no time but to eat sleep and work. :/ Sorry! Anyhow, my store manager wants to move me to Jewelry from Cashier, which is a great position, but for a nearing 20-year-old with a GED in the works and no idea where or who I am or want to be, it's not much. Plus, it pays a good ol' 11.50 an hour, for anywhere from 10 to 40 hours a week with plenty of toxic people. I love what I do and even the customers, but my bosses and coworkers are just disgusting, to be honest. They gossip, stab each other in the back, fight for control and even worse get each other fired. As mentioned in my other posts, I'm the 5th longest employee in my department to stay there, and our most senior employee has made it 5 years. I've been there almost a year now and the sheer uncertainty of it all scares me every day I come in. I've had my job threatened over nothing 3 times.That, and my mental health has degraded so far that I can't find pleasure or even bring myself to do the things I used to love, and my dad is worried I'm so depressed I might end it. I don't want to get there, or worry him, or be where I am. I have no idea how I let it all get so far out of control. I wish I knew how to fix myself or help myself. Maybe I should just quit. I'm just afraid I can't find another job, or I'll be labeled a leech or something like a basement dweller. I want to be in control of my life, but it seems everyone is afraid I'll never be who I want to be, and I can't let them down. Sorry for such a long post, and I wish I had a way to condense it but this is just stream of thought. ","1"
"hey so first just ignore the way this is written i'm french my English is ok but not great .

Like i don't hate life but it's just tiring and annoying and long and i just don't enjoy it ! and my life is not sad or whatever but honestly i feel that any distraction like seeing friend , doing thing , are just thing to trick our human brain in enjoying life like a survival mecanism i dont know ! because we 2nd problem i personnaly think that we are way less alive than what we think i mean we are just a bunch of cell litteraly everything that make  us is chemical reaction everything so i just don't see why would anyone want to live . I am at a point where i just dont get people i really dont think that  human  the species is any way special but we feel like we are so i personnaly feel obligate to enjoy life but if i just dont want to . I really im not suicidal but i would like to find an answer or die in a way where i wouldnt have any control car accident or understanding why people enjoy life and enjoying it myself without feeling like im tricking myself into enjoy it .To be fair im looking for response like how do you motivate yourself to live ?have you ever feel like that ? am i missing something ?  also the"" notice this message please ""in the title is because i want answer and i've nerver post on reddit but i've seen so many post without answer so it just to catch people attention bye !

"I feel as if everything around me is falling apart and my motivation to do anything has withered. I used to be driven to do law. I even signed a contract to do my undergrad at UC Berkeley and I'm about to lose it due to my lack of motivation to even want to get out of bed, let alone keep up with 5 fucking APs and debate. and what scares me the most is that I dont even care. I have this rising resentment inside of me for my family and just anything that requires effort. Maybe that makes me lazy but I really just cant find any purpose in doing anything. and oddly, suicide almost feels comforting. I feel as if I exist and I am so fucking aware of my exist that it becomes crippling because this awareness is not attached to a purpose. this is fucking all over the place and I have no idea how to articulate what I'm feeling right now but yeah.

"So Ive already had depression for a year and a half now, but ever since June-Sept 2017 Ive been feeling so much better. Then during October, I found out that the girl Ive liked for so long is dating someone and Ive been heartbroken ever since. My depression came back and its much worse than before. I would have mood swings everyday and some days I have no motivation to do anything. I guess part of why Im depressed because Ive never got to fully have a chance with this girl. Weve only ever had small talk once in a while, but we were never at a point  where we got super close. I was planning to confess to her this year, but knowing that I now cant really hurts me more than anything. And everyday I have to see her with her boyfriend, all happy and cheery together. And as a person whos been dead and have no emotions for the longest time ever, Ive cried for someone for the first time ever. Everyday within the first week of finding out. Ive tried moving on but there really isnt someone for me out there. Im stuck in this shitty situation what can I do?","1"

Telling her everything even though i didnt know her was the best thing even though im beating myseld for opening up. I think i might start therapy because of her. She made me feel hopeful.

"So Im autistic, to get that out of the way.  Ive been acutely depressed for almost two years now, and non-acutely depressed my entire life.  Im an opiate addict, a benzodiazepine addict, and a nicotine addict.I recently found that cbd allowed me to have emotional connections with people in ways that Id never had before.  I cared so much about everybodys life, and I for once in my life genuinely wanted to share in their emotions.Fast forward to Monday.Im driving back to school from Home for thanksgiving (12 hours).  At the exact halfway point I get into an accident.  Im not a stranger to accidents.  I bump into other peoples cars with my own fairly often because of how easily distracted I am.  Ive always come away with just a scratch in the paint and no real damage.This wasnt like that.  A billboard caught my attention and I glanced that way and started drifting.  Into the trailer wheel of the car hauling a classic car next to me.  My right front wheel is practically torn off, so its completely undrivable.  Im 6 hours away from either place I could call home.The police come, standard report, no injuries.  The people with the trailer were able to just drive away.  No damage.  But my car is a wreck.  Im autistic, so the moment this all happened I went into the worst meltdown Id ever had.  I couldnt stop crying and shaking, and once or twice almost darted out into oncoming traffic.  Luckily, I called my parents and they walked me through everything and said they were on their way.  But its a 6 hour drive and I have to wait somewhere, which we decide to be a hospital.The police officer was supposed to take me but got called off on dispatch before the tow truck could get there.  The tow truck drivers said they couldnt take me anywhere.  Roadside assistance said they couldnt take me anywhere.  So an ambulance was called.  But they couldnt take my biggest box in the ambulance.This box contained my Nintendo Switch and pro controller, along with all of my games.  I couldnt take it with me, so I had to leave it in the car and trust the towing company.Mistake.The next day, upon arriving at the repair shop I found that my all of my valuables were missing.Fuck.This game console was one of the few things in life that gave me joy.  I cant afford to buy a new one.  I have to spend that money on opiates.  Cue more meltdowns.  The first time Ive screamed at my parents.  So here I am.  I was just beginning to learn to love and share emotions with others and somebody does this to me.What the fuck.Edit: a wordSecond edit:Seriously, what the fuck?!?  What did I do to deserve this on top of every other piece of shit thing thats happened to me in my life?  Why wont my parents just fucking give up on me and let me kill myself?","1"

"I'm going to be brutally honest here. I've been into porn from a young age (back when the internet would go down if someone was using the phone in the house) At 26 my hormone levels still get a bit crazy each day and I need my fix. The most I have ever fapped in one day is twice which isn't that bad. I have a PornHub account and I know a lot of pornstars (male and female by name) I also follow a lot of them on my Instagram (I don't even care what people think lol) and have a seperate Twitter account I use when I'm horny (unlike other social media sites Twitter is pretty open to 18+ content, I don't use my RL profile picture on that account obviously I follow tons of performers on there and it's nice to see the other side of them sometimes) I paid for Pornhub Premium by accident once (free trial gone wrong) I don't know if I'm addicted and I don't know if it helps deal with depression or makes it worse. Personally don't feel guilty most of the time. I know it's just a fantasy but when I have to fap I can't resist it. Obviously having a girlfriend would be better but even then I think I would still fap. It's just sex isn't it? Should men feel shame for loving porn?I'm also into hentai but I'll admit that's a little fucked up at times. I can't watch incest, rape or tentacle shit.","1"
"I'm getting tired of battling with my thoughts everyday. Happiness has eluded me for as long as I can remember. My brain seems programmed to constantly loathe myself even though I know I'm a good person and that I should love myself. I've tried meditation and mindfulness but the effects are temporary. I hit my lowest last year during my senior year of high school (I know this is a shitty time in life for a lot of people) and things have improved since but it's still lingering. It's frustrating to know that I lead an extremely privileged life but can't take advantage of it because of my fucked up head. I'm wondering if there's anyone out there who has an experience similar to mine and has found something that helps. I'm going to the doctor pretty soon to hopefully be prescribed a mild antidepressant. Also I have multiple family members who have suffered from depression so I'm thinking I could be predisposed. Thanks for reading.","1"
"Sorry if I'm bad at this its my first time and if you're reading this thank you. I just wanted to get some stuff off my chest because I can't trust anyone enough to tell them anything and my struggling to cope.I'm a 17 year old male and I see myself with no future. I have an eating disorder called ARFID which I have lived with since I was 3 years old. ARFID makes it extremely hard to try new foods but I must have some rare case where it also affects my drinking. Usually I have a piece of toast for breakfast with cheese, a packet of crisps for lunch because I don't like the canteen food, and a small dinner. My diet is terrible and I only drink fizzy drinks. I have tried to drink water multiple times but I can only manage a couple of sips before I start gagging which in some cases led to me being sick. I don't eat veg and I only eat fruit some days. This eating disorder makes me avoid going outside if it involves eating with others so I only leave the house for college and to visit my grandparents. This is because at restaurants the waiter will always give me a funny look when they give me what is considered a ""kids"" meal and I feel like every person in there is staring at me making me feel so stupid.What makes it worse is that my parents are divorced. My dad has a girlfriend who has two kids, both are teenagers, and every time we go out for food her son always has a funny look when he sees the food I have on my plate compared to him and everyone else. It makes me feel like I'm not normal. I've tried to avoid going out for meals but my mum thinks that I just want to play my computer games.I'm afraid to tell my family about it because they will just suggest things that I know won't produce results but they think that it will. The only possible way for me to get rid of it is hypnosis which is expensive as there is only one known person who has a high success rate and I don't want my family paying for that because I'm just a burden to them, I'd rather them have the money to spend on themselves.I feel like people want nothing to do with me. The only best friend I had ditched me two days in a row to hang out with his new friends from the school he moved to. I was with 4 of my close family members and I told them I was going to meet up with my friend. 10 minutes later I have to walk into the room and explain to them that he didn't show up where we arranged to meet and when I phoned him he was with a group of other people. It was so embarrassing and I had to pretend like I didn't care because sometimes when I cry in front of my mum she tells me I'm too old to cry and boys don't cry.I don't have a single person in this world that I can trust to tell them how I really feel. I just cry in my room quietly once everyone has gone too sleep and listen to rap like Eminem, token and my personal favourite NF. If your still reading this and like rap about depression I strongly recommend NF, he has some really good music.In secondary school I drifted away from all of my close friends from my primary school because their new friends didn't like me. I've always been shy around new people and I was happy with the friends that I had so I didn't put much effort into making new friends. I had a group of friends who I play computer games with who are from my town but they have other friends who I don't like so I don't meet up with them outside of college. My grades started slipping in secondary school because I lost all interest in everything. I quit the football team I played for and my grades went from A's to struggling to get C's. My mum always says ""I know you could've done better if you didn't play your computer games so much"" but that's not the case, I just don't care anymore they mean nothing to me.I started off good I'm college, I made friends with the majority of people in my class and was getting distinctions in most of my subjects. About half way through the first year I got that attitude back. I kept thinking what's the point? Why should these grades determine my life? I don't want to compete with people to have a hard job that pays good money. All I want is to be happy. Money isn't the most important thing to me, I just want to be around people who I can talk to about anything and that I can feel comfortable around.My life doesn't matter anyway. I will die a premature death because of my eating disorder and I don't think there's anyway to stop a premature death. I'm not afraid to die but I don't want my family to have to suffer with me dying which is the reason why I won't commit suicide.If you read any of this I appreciate it and I hope you're doing ok.","1"
"I don't know. I went to this subreddit with the intention to relieve myself. I wanted to talk the pressure away that I constantly feel. Now I'm sitting in front of my screen staring at the screen (duh) without anything coming to my mind. I had an idea, some sort of structure for what I was going to write down. Right now I am just writing down things that come to my mind when I think about myself. Well yeah. I am 19 years old (in the bloom of youth lel), coming from a middle class family, money isn't raining on me but it's not like I have to pinch pennies. I have a car and a roof above my head, both of my parents, my brother and my sister are alive and healthy. Its kind of funny that I am including my siblings in this list. They are total strangers to me, I feel like I don't know anything about them besides their name and age and I am not sure about their age. One could say that I am a pathetic piece of shit wallowing in self-pity because I am not appreciating what I have. I totally agree if anyone likes to say that, except for the last part. Is it really self-pity? I don't fucking now. The world is such a messed up place. We humans are trapped in an economy system that we invented and can't stop anymore. Capitalism is the root of most bad stuff that happens around the globe. No matter what the problem or issue is, in the end it comes down to money. It's all about money. Money money money. An abstract product we invented ourselves and now the invention has enslaved its inventor. I came to this conclusion quite a few years ago and yet I'm writing this on a Razer keyboard staring at an Asus screen, wearing Nike pants. How ironic. This world is fucked and there won't be any change. I don't even know why I'm telling this to you guys but I won't delete it now. The point is - if this mess of a text has a point -  I feel empty. I feel so damn empty. I'm feeling like I'm faking a whole person throughout the day at work. My life has no purpose, I have no purpose, no one has a purpose. I became so disconnected from my family and relatives, even close friends. I chat, crack a joke here and there but as soon as I am alone there's nothing but guilt, worries, doubts over doubts and this goddamn habit of questioning every single stupid little thing of my pointless life. Sometimes I think that I am not me anymore. It sounds pathetic and sad at the same time, but there is the thought that I am not the person I am. I sometimes feel like there is the person that my body represents and that everybody knows, and then there's me. My head or brain so to say. What the fuck am I even writing here. Maybe I should mention that I got diagnosed with severe depression a few years ago but I never accepted it nor did anything to battle it. The psychologist told me the results and I got up, left the room and never came back. I didn't call for another appointment or anything. Mostly because I won't let somebody label me like this. Oh yeah, lets stuff him in the drawer where these other people with mental illnesses are. Nope. Sometimes I feel like going on a killing spree but it's not that easy in my country to get the right tools. Sounds kinda sick what I just wrote down. On the other hand I never physically attacked anyone and I probably never will, mostly because I am a weak little stick. Did I mention that my BMI is 16.84? A lot of people see food and eating as something that you must enjoy. I don't. I just stuff something inside my stomach every few days to make the noise and cramps stop. Call it life long suicide haha. Why am I even telling this. I just don't know what to do. It's like being constantly bored, 24/7/365, but you are bored and disgusted by your own person, personality, life, whatever. I am constantly shifting between caring about everything, thinking about the future of humanity and planet earth, having (more or less) well planned ideas about saving this or doing that. Two days (or hours) later I feel nothing but hate and disgust. It's not that severe during daytime because there's always something going on, something that distracts me or keeps me busy. I often find myself staring at the wall or the floor for... I seriously don't know how long. Sometimes it's like my body falls asleep but my mind is more or less awake but without any conscious thoughts. At least without any thoughts I can remember. I want to kill myself, but then I think about my friends and parents and how much this would hurt them, but at the same time I'm thinking ""why should I care? I'm not there anymore to feel any pain"" and of course I know that everyone who might be hurt is still there, being alive. I can talk to myself for hours like that. Nothing makes sense, everything makes sense, nothing has a purpose, everything has a purpose... I don't know and frankly I don't fucking care. At least for now. Until I have the next emotional high that lasts for a few hours or two days and after that we're going down the rabbit hole again.I just wrote down a lot of bullshit. A lot of shit. Shitty shit. I just read through it again and I am kinda disgusted but at the same time I'm thinking ""I don't fucking care"". Yeah. A whole paragraph of embarrassing, pathetic self-pity bullshit. I could jump right out of the fucking window. But I know that I'm too lazy and afraid, mostly because the thing I call myself is an embarrassing mess. I wish that I could just stop existing with the press of a button. ""Huh there are guns for that"" - yeah well, good luck getting your hands on one. I had the intention to end this text and now I'm writing all of that bullshit down. I should really get a rope or something. Fuck it. If you read to this point I owe you an apology because you just wasted your time. Did you really waste it? Would you have done something brilliant in that time? Why I am I even asking these questions like I am some sort of preacher. A preacher of nihilism at  best. Fuck it. Lets make this the last time I've ever posted something anywhere.","1"
"I had just finished college and bought my first car last June. It cost all of my money. It was a great car for its price and could have lasted me years. I was in a minor accident a mere two weeks after getting it, but it was only 50 worth of damage so I got off easy. I got a job working minimum wage in a call center for insurance the same month. Its an ok job but the money is mere peanuts for the labor of having to listen to people shout at me all day. I'm currently back living with my parents after college in a rural village and don't have many friends. All of them are either living back in Galway where I went to college or have moved to England or Canada. My life is basically get up, go to work, go home, spend the rest of my day on my laptop, sleep. A pretty dull life but my plan was to build up money, get my own place and find a good job with my software degree down in Dublin. However since last month, thinks started to take a turn for the worst. I was told I may not pass probation and will be let go by December because of my call quality. My alcoholic brother tried to choke me to death and I refuse to speak to him anymore. And to top it all off, I totaled my new car yesterday after skidding on black ice and rolled down a hill into a farmers field, destroying his gate and fencing. I came out unharmed but felt like a total idiot as I downright refused to learn my lesson about speeding last time. Now I have no car, the one thing I had, barely any money to buy a new one, have to pay for the damage to the farmers property, and I am in the process of losing my crappy job should I not pass probation. I am literally going nowhere in life. I feel it has no purpose. I barely speak to my friends, only my parents. My mother (despite good intentions) treats me like a child and my father always just berates me on what I should and shouldn't do. I just wish I died in that car accident and stopped being a burden to both them and the world.","1"
"I hate to put it words I never have. Barely in my own head... I think she's gone for...good.. I just have this impossible feeling. I don't know how to deal with it. Its just an insane amount of anger I hate the thief. How heartless can you be to steal someone's family member? How is that possible? I could never do it! It's even possible for me to get to a point where I'd steal a family member from someone maybe for money... I don't know if she's dead or not at this point... She's ""just a dog"" to society but to me she's family and I can't stand how I can't find her or she could be dead and if they're caught all they have to do is go to jail for a while. I just can't. I miss her... so...much... ","1"
"It's starting to become a problem. Like i'm sleeping when i'm not tired mostly just to avoid reality. If theres some important date on the horizon or some event that i'm dreading I sleep to try and prolong the time I have until whatever it is comes. Never works though; It always just feels like a waste when I wake up. Its not fulfilling sleep either, as I frequently wake up and go back to sleep at maybe hour or so intervals. I also have no energy, but im unsure as to whether its caused by oversleeping or the other way around. Maybe theyre unrelated. It definetly hurts my selfimage of myself. Makes me feel useless, like a waste. Donno.","1"
"I don't really know. I can't sleep at night anymore, and am incredibly unproductive. I don't eat much even though I know I should, but I'm not that hungry. I feel really alone. I don't know how people meet other who like them and want to be with them. I try not to show how sad I am in public, so It's not like I'm scaring people off that way. I have some friends, but they are all new because It's first semester of Freshman year. I have one close friend, and I feel lucky to have even one, but I don't really want to put this on her since there's nothing she can really do about it. I really like feeling needed, so I end up being the person a lot of my friends go to to talk to. I often feel like I am giving more than I'm getting though, and while I love being there for people, even people I don't know, it's kind of hard. I don't want to tell any of my friends I'm struggling this much because I don't want them to see that side of me. But it's so hard for me to seek help. There are so many steps and I'm already busy. I tried to reach out earlier this year, and got pretty far but then I lost motivation to continue. I constantly think about dying, but I know I would never do it. I keep thinking about what I want to do in the future, like travel and things like that, but each day it seems less and less likely I'll ever get there because there's college, and then possibly grad school, and then I have to work to pay off debts, and I'll probably just get stuck in a job for the rest of my life. I don't even know what I want to do with my life. It doesn't help that I don't really have interests and I'm not really that great at anything. I feel like I'm drowning in my school work but it's my own fault because I procrastinate so much (like right now) and I blame most things on my adhd including not eating as much as I know I should. It's scaring me though because before I knew I had adhd, in high school I wouldn't eat on purpose because when everything else in my mind was chaos, what I put in my body was something I could fully control. Losing weight was my one success when I was struggling with everything else. It's been years since then and I have gotten better, but since often I'm so busy I forget to eat, or I'm just not hungry, I feel like I'm getting sucked back in. I know I've lost weight, and I'm scared that I like the feeling of achievement from it. Also a guy I may or may not have had a crush on (one of my only guy friends) decided it would be fun to gaslight me which hurt because I thought we were friends... I haven't talked to him in a week and I kind of miss him, but I was always the one to start conversations so I feel like even though he said he liked talking to me, I was just annoying him. Plus even if we ended up going out, it wouldn't be fair to him. I'm too messed up right now for anyone to have to deal with. Plus I feel like I would have to go really slowly in the physical part of a relationship because this guy at a party tried to touch me when I was drunk. Nothing happened as far as I know but I don't feel comfortable anymore. But most guys at my school are only looking for a hookup, so it looks like I'll be alone for a long time. I don't think I can just live one day at a time anymore. I feel like I'm not experiencing life. I feel like I am breathing stale air and everything Is fake, and nothing matters. On top of all this emotional shit is the fact that I have finals soon, and I'm not ready and I have had a tension headache for a week and it won't go away with Advil. I'm pretty sure it's because I don't sleep enough, but I physically can't fall asleep no matter how long I lay in bed and ""fake it till I make it""If you read all of this, wow. I hope all of you have a better day than I'm having.","1"
"If you go trough my account you can see that anxiety, self-injury, depression and suicidal ideation are some very frequently reoccurring problems in my life.I had been researching bridges and jumping off them and went to a bridge on Sunday night in the city 45 minutes away from my home. I actually tried to go to one bridge and then decided to go home, but I had to cross a river to get back into the state, so I crossed another bridge, wanted to get out to see the bridge, and parked (actually in my state and walked back into the the city). I stayed on the bridge for a while and called my professor who stayed on the line with me until I went back to my car and who then called my parents.  My dad spoke to me and my mom refused too, but I don't have a great or comofortable relationship with my parents.I went to a psychiatric hospital the next day with a friend to get a psych assessment done, and went back today, but nothing much came of it because they do case management and the lady said my social worker I've been seeing for therapy is acting as my case manager.  I did not get commited even after telling them the bridge thing and admitting self-harm. Unfortunately, I didn't get to see a psychiatrist.I told my therapist on Tuesday and this increased her concern for me exponentially.  Unknown to me, after the last session when I had read parts of my blog saying I wanted to do things like jump into a rock quarry and commit suicide by cop, she had been looking up other therapy services for me and low-income psychiatric care.  She wants to begin meeting with me twice a week from now on, which seems like a lot, but her, me and my friends and professor thought the treatment I was receiving was not sufficient.I'm working out my options and the women at the psychiatric hospital talked to me about a day hospital program on a sliding  scale with a psychiatrist and sliding scale psychiatrists. My therapist talked to me about a DBT group and low income psychiatrists as well.Many people have expressed they love me and care about me, so I feel I'm less likely to attempt to do this a third time than ever.  I hope I can pursue more intensive treatment, because the next stop after for me would literally be death. I'm even excited to take medication because I've spent my older childhood, teenagehood and adulthood unable to focus, lacking motivation, failing school, paranoid, anxious and many other unpleasant things.Things are going much better and I hope other people on here can get help too.","1"
"Everything is just sorta ""meh"". People reach out and I ignore them till they fade away. I push away people that like me.

"So Monday I briefly talked with a teacher who I trust a bit about how Im feeling. He recommended  I talk to the school psychologist and with my permission emailed him to make an appointment with me. So today I had to go and see the school psychologist. I only talked to him for about ten minutes before he was interrupted by having to go to where a fight broke out (Im in high school). He wants to meet with me tomorrow. I honestly didnt like the session today. I felt like I was talking to a script. Lots of basic questions like hows your home life, any recent big changes, etc. It did confirm that I dont feel good. I had to hold back tears. The problem is the rest of the day I felt so bad because the appointment surfaced all the negative feelings Im having. On a completely unrelated note I came today to find out we have to put our dog down Friday. I feel awful about that. I really dont want to talk to the school psychologist tomorrow. Should I email him and say that, ask the teacher who recommended I see him email him , or go in and just say I dont want to talk to him. I think talking about how I feel could be good in the future but now is not a good time. Im not sure what to do.","1"

"As far back as I can remember, I've known a feeling of anxiety. Depression usually followed right after or vice versa.At a young age I was exposed to a lot. My parents were young, my mother was 18 when I was born and my step-dad was 16 (my mother was already pregnant when they started dating.) They had a rather good support system between my (assumed, long story for another post) bio-father's side of the family being involved throughout and after my birth, my mom's side being involved and my step-dad's family being very involved.My step-dad was strict, but forgiving. Mean, but soft. My mother tells me all the time how my (to clear things up, incase I write more than I am intending to atm, ""dad"" is my step-dad and ""father"" is my assumed bio-father) dad was always fascinated with the way I was quite intuitive and intelligent at a young age. He loved me as his own and that love still holds true today.My parents had another kid, my sister, 2 years later and my brother came another 2 years later. I don't remember much before my little brother's birth, but I do remember some great and terrible things from when I can.My parents went through a lot of drama between infidelity, alcoholism, abuse both ways and I saw them fight quite a few times. Punches, kicks, choke holds, tears, knots, bruises, cuts, blood, sweat. I remember most of them quite vividly but they don't exactly haunt me. They don't make me feel depressed or anything most of the time, but there's times when the memories make me furious or sad. To varying degrees, as well. Some days it's a Denzel tear, others it's a full blown meltdown holding my pillow and sobbing uncontrollably into it.Growing older, I got socially awkward and very introverted. I was a skinny kid until maybe 6 or 7 idk. I got pretty big and self-image was a huge issue for me. I remember beating myself up mentally whenever I looked in mirrors. I felt out of place everywhere I went, rarely feeling ""welcomed"" or invited. I remember feeling shame or guilt often, whether it was warrented or not.I never really approached kids in school, they usually approached me. They were usually the naughtier kids. I moved schools a lot, too. Between all of the moving before I got to HS, I had been to 9 or 10 schools. All of them usually had a similar group of misfits that gravitated toward me. Maybe because they were the only ones not afraid of my rather serious look all the time.Whatever the reason, I was never quite left alone in school.Bullying wasn't a huge problem because I looked rather big and mean, could even be mistaken for the bully most of the time. But there were always a few little shitheads who would poke fun in front of other people for their own ego stroking. I took them rather terribly because I'd beat myself up in my own head without it but with more fuel and real life experience to torment my thoughts, I became more and more introverted and awkward. ESPECIALLY around girls because of my insecurities.At a young age I was also introduced to pornography. A cousin of mine pulled me aside into one of the rooms one day and had me watch one with him. I became aroused and experiemented with that on my own at that time and became addicted to porn immediately. It started to consume my everyday thoughts. I've read that the link between porn addiction and depression is unmistakable, but with so many different events in my life, I assume mine is a culmination of all the tragic events. I remember being depressed before watching porn.After porn entered my life, everything was perversed for me and this created even more isolation and introversion as I associate any affection with sexual arousal. Yet another shithole I fell into. I couldn't be affectionate with anyone because my mind was where I didn't want it to be but I couldn't help it. I knew it was wrong and I also couldn't control it or understand it so I started to feel guilt, disgust and shame daily. Yet I craved affection and attention and love.Fast forward to 8th grade, my younger brother was diagnosed with cancer. A rare form, Desmo Plastic Small Round Cell Tumor. He was transported to the childrens hospital in the city and my sister and I stayed with our grandparents for a few months before moving to the city with my mom to be closer to the hospital. After a long battle, his fight came to an end on August 20th, 2009. Roughly after 10 AM. I remember the day like it was yesterday. I was in my science class watching MythBusters. After the lunch bell rang I gathered up and headed toward the cafeteria, but before I could get there, my mom's boyfriend at the time was there to get me out of school. My heart fell into my stomach as I lied to myself and said my brother was fine over and over, but I knew he wasn't. After waiting what seemed like a century to get to the hospice (I didn't know what that was/meant at the time), and another century waiting inside the hospice without access to my mother, brother or dad. I sat in angst. I already knew. I couldn't cry. I still had a glimmer of hope, or naivete. But, when we were told officially, I felt empty.This made HS miserable, paired with my mother's depression, alcoholism and aching heart. I don't remember days being much different outside of being afraid of getting home to my mom being abused (even tho she started it most of the time,) dreading school because I was unhappy with myself and how awkward I was, and spending hours upon hours in a giant public library doing anything but reading books. They had a counseling class that met once a week but I didn't always go, and I didn't always share anything.There's much more that I went through, but that about sums up what I feel are the roots of my depression. I haven't spoken to any professionals, I have been wanting to the last few days because I've been very depressed and I made a lot of progress within the last 2 months that I don't want to undo.I was in a state of clarity, peace, my mind was clear, I had energy, I could stay on task and finish everything and be ""normal."" I stopped wondering why I was depressed, I stopped feeling it all together and just sort of went with the flow. I found that I slip in and out of this quite often and I never really ""knew"" knew until today. I would say I come in and out of enlightenment.My first big enlightenment that I could fully comprehend came from an incident in which I fell for my best friend who I never even met in person, but rather through Facebook. We never really even talked on FB until one day we did and then somehow we started talking. It was on and off at first, we'd talk for a few days at a time, then a day or week betwen then again. Then one day we just started talking every day. I was in college at the time, but I dropped out after 2 semesters. We talked about everything and she just listened and responded and was invested and showed interest and cared and all the things bestfriends feel like. I knew not to fall in love, that it couldn't be between us, but somehow I was in lala land and I did anyway.One day she killed my ego involuntarily. She was just confiding in me and telling me about an encounter with an ex and I got hurt and jealous and told her then proceeded to block her on everything. I felt numb, I sensation I felt before, but this time it killed my ego. I hit rock botttom. She has forgiven me since and we talk still, but not as often as before. We've both been busy in our own lives so neither of us take it offensive.I slipped back into a state of depression and ego recently and I caught myself when crying in my car lastnight while beating myself up in my mind (the thoughts were not literally of me beating myself, but of me being tortured and weird shit like that by others. Specifically women. Idk why. I'm weird, ok?) I started to question why I had those thoughts and came across a few reddit posts and read through a few. I also swiftly Googled anti-depressants and how they work. What depression is and such. Now I am considering medication, but I am honestly scared to visit the doctor's office. Not entirely sure why either.The moments of clarity or enlightenment or whatever you want to call it, I would like to have much more of that. I am very productive and my mind isn't all over the place and I don't wake up depressed or anxious or beat myself up in my head all day. I suppose I will visit a doctor soon, but being 100% honest idk how long I'll procrastinate. If at all. I'd love to hear from anyone that has experienced something similar either in childhood experiences or the sudden enlightenment/slipping in and out of enlightenment.I know this was a lot to read, but if you did take the time to read all the way through, thank you. I hope to hear replies, questions, suggestions, your stories. Whatever. I'm open for dicussion.","1"

"Every day I am exhausted, emotionally and physically.I had fairly verbally abusive / neglectful family, I feel like I was strong for so long but over time I just got eroded and now there is nothing left. I think about suicide every day, when I wake up, before I go to bed, when I have anything difficult happen during the day..It's almost sick, my main coping mechanism that keeps me going is ""Well if it gets too bad I can just kill myself"".Nervous about meeting a new person? ""Well if it gets too bad I can just kill myself"".Job interview? ""Well if it gets too bad I can just kill myself"".Date? Ha, just kidding.But when I really start thinking about it, I'm terrified of death.. I honestly don't know if I could do it.. My mind has been the one safe place. The place I can escape too.

"I'm doing very poorly but like... I've already triple texted my gf and she isn't replying and I don't want to bother her anymore because I don't want to be too needy. My dad's at work and besides probably would be disappointed in me that I'm skipping class again. I'm trying to go to class but like... I'm failing with no chance of recovery. My friends are all in class or at work or otherwise would be annoyed with me.I tried to make an appointment with my newer therapist for today or tomorrow and the receptionist hung up on me. I think it might have been because I told her I was checking my schedule and she thought I forgot to hang up but I can tell she doesn't like me and I feel like idk she's annoyed with me.There's a drop in at the local lgbt center where I have a case manager who could help me, but yesterday I needed him to talk to me about housing resources (I did my own research and wanted to talk to someone who could advise me if my plan was sound) and he avoided me. The other case manager seemed to be beyond annoyed that I was talking to her and like idk. Every time I talk while I'm there I feel like the people in charge are annoyed with me. I don't want to be a bother me person who makes everything difficult.I'm in bed and I'm still trying to go to class but I don't want to see my roommate because she's in the process of kicking me out and it's really awkward and I've visibly been crying. I don't want to put that on her and make her accuse me of manipulating her. Rational me knows this is all stupid and I should go to class but now me just feels like garbage and I just want to cry more.I wish I had work because if I go to work I can just put all my issues into it and like idk, do a good job and feel better? But I'm not scheduled until Friday.Edit: I fucking trained myself to be alone and to accept that no one would wanna be around me because I'm the worst, and then I made friends and started dating this girl I like a lot and now that no one likes me anymore it hurts. I keep letting myself think I deserve to be around people and deserve anything and then when the truth hits me and I remember what annoying garbage I am it hurts more. The fact that I feel lonely means that I want friends and people in my life when I don't deserve it which is disgusting and if people know how much I wanted people to be kind to me and like me they would be absolutely disgusted.","1"
"To preface, I tried to commit suicide when I was in college. When it didn't work,  I started starving myself and working out 6 hours a day. When my friends noticed and I couldn't avoid them,  I started putting myself in as many potentially dangerous, ""adventurous"" activities as I could. I still do that. I've not tried again outright since the first time, but the weight on me was always there. Now I wake up every morning wondering if today is the day that those impulses come roaring back and if I could handle them this time. Sometimes I think I could, but sometimes I know that I couldn't.

I can't even will myself to play through a video game for more than 10 mins.   I can't really explain the feeling to any of my friends or family.

"When I started feeling weird, I didn't want to talk about it. I hided it from my closest friends, made excuses for why I was missing classes. Then, I started telling a lot of people, little by little, and since I broke that barrier, I would spend many hours trying to explain how I was feeling. But I felt very tired and frustrated after venting about it. No one ever said something mean or inconsiderate, like ""you're just making excuses"" or ""it's not even a real disease"". No, they never did that, and I know I'm more lucky than most. The thing is, I never felt like they quite get that I felt incapable of doing everyday tasks or to feel pleasure doing stuff. Everytime I said I was sad and unmotivated, they would tell they felt the same way too, and it was normal (it was not normal and not the same). Like, they would act like it was a normal sadness. Or they would tell me to just get distracted, get a hobbie, when it was impossible for me to distract myself from my negative auto-destructive thoughts. Everyone kept giving a lot of generic advise that didn't work out, and I know they had the best intentions, but I felt very frustrated that I couldn't quite explain or speak in a way they would understand how was the feeling. Also, I got this feeling that they were acting like it was a simple problem, with a simple solution. Just get up and be positive. A friend of mine once told me that her grandmother was also depressed, but that she (the grandmother) didn't try and didn't want to be helped, that her grandma was at fault. It's like people think is so easy and they can't get why you're torturing yourself. I know, I know it seems like I'm complaining when I was so lucky they cared about me and supported me the best way they could. And I was being naive to expect people would 100% get me. Also, it's not their obligation to get me or ""fix"" me. It's just I realized it was not working or doing me any good to spend so many hours talking about it with someone else than my therapist. I stopped talking so much about it, but sometimes I compusively start talking about it with my dad or with my mom. I feel very tired and sad and frustrated afterwards. Do you feel the same way?","1"

"I was born with an Imperforate Anus, which mean i don't have an anus when i was born. My parent sold their house to try to fix me. After 6 years on and off the hospital, i finally got a surgery to fix that but it come with its own problem, i can't really control my bowel. I grow up with that situation where i don't know when i'm going to take a dump. It may sound silly, but shitting your pants at a teenager and have them laughing at you is not a comfortable at the slightest. I tried my best at school but i never really excel, whenever i fail something people would told me that my family spent everything on me and i turn out like this, that i'm a burden to everyone. My closet friend move away when i was 12 and was left alone without any friends for a long time. That was when i started feeling depressed. I live with that depression my whole life, but i did a very good job hiding it, no one know i have it, because i always laughing and joking in class and at work. However, when the night come and i was alone with my thought, i always think of myself at a failure and i deserve to die, but i keep pushing on. I finally have a close group of friends, those that i can called my brothers, and thing was good, for a while.I had to move to the US with my family 3 years ago, leaving all my friends and my grandfather behind. In the US, i was alone, having no friend, my family scatter around, barely speaking the language and have to survive by myself, then the depression come back. There are many days that i want to end everything, but somehow i can still keep going. Everyday was as dark as the other, until the day i talked to her. She was my classmate in High school back in my country, we barely talk to each other on facebook, i used to like her back then but she already in a relationship so i didn't start anything then. One day i chatting her up on facebook, she told me about her divorce, how her husband treated her badly. I was there to talk to her, to share everything with her, and before i know it i fell in love with her, and she fell for me. We started a relationship, and those were the best days of my life. We can talk about everything, can joke about everything, we are just like best friend that love each other, everything was perfect. I waited for 6 months before i can comeback to my country to visit her and my friends. That 1 months with them i could never forget.After i got back to the US, i worked my ass off so i can build an actual future with her, and started to talk less because of my schedule. She told my that she was pregnant with my baby a month after i got back to the US, i was overjoy when heard that news. But bad thing keep happening to me, she had a miscarriage and lost our baby. We cried, a lot. Every night i dreamed of a kid who keep following me, i asked them who are they, and they told me ""Why can't i live with you and mom, why can't we be together?"". I cried my eyes out every single night. I tried to work harder so thing like that would never happen again, I thought that by doing it i can marry her and we can live together forever, but she thought that i was avoid her and no longer love her, but never tell me how she felt. There was that 1 extremely bad week when i was pressured by my school, my family, and my job, i barely sleep and had no energy to function. She also had a bad week and want to talk to me about it, however i was to tired to talk to her properly and i just half-assed talking to her. And that was the breaking point, she thought i no longer love her and her feeling for me started to go away. After that one week i began talking to her normally again, but she didn't seem like she want to talk. She said that she was sick and don't want to talk so i told her to remember to take her medicine, i dont want her to get sick, and i stopped calling her, yet still message her everyday. She never reply. One day I asked her and she told me that she no longer love me.The whole world crashing down on me. I begged, I cried, I explained to her everything, she wouldn't give me a chance. I was gonna ask her to marry me next summer, now everything is gone. I cried for the whole week, many time i was so close to commiting suicide but i held back because maybe i can still win her back. So I kept caring for her, talking to her although she never reply. I thought if I show her how much i really love her she will change her mind. Until one day i found out she already got a new lover before she broke up with me, and that crushed me. I asked her if she has anything going on with that person, and she agressively refused to answer. She told me that do i want to control her, that i always think what i want to think and never listen to her, she never did anything wrong, and she can answer it but she doesn't want to. My heart broke, i just want her to admit it herself so i know that she is still truthful with me, but she couldn't do it. I show her the proof and she change her tone, she said she couldn't lie to me so she couldn't said no. I felt like she has been lying to me for a long time. But i can't bring myself to be angry at her, i still love her so much. She came to me when i was in my darkest moments, she was the hope, the light that help me overcome everything. When she left, she took away all of that, now i'm alone with my own depression, when my mom saw me crying because of her, she told me to kill myself. I was closer to the edge than ever, i just want her back, i begged her and her new lover to let her comeback to me, that obviously failed. I talked to a lot of people, they all tell me that this will past, just try to forget her, everything will be fine .etc. I tried to go on with my normal life but she keep popping up in my head, her voice, her face, her smell, everything, and the depression hit. My kid comeback in my dream and asked me ""Why mom and dad fight? Why you are not together anymore?"". I tried to keep pushing on, I really did, but I can't imagine living a life without her. I can be working and studying 1 moment, and broke down the next moment because her memories came back in my head. I can't keep it going any longer and this time i think i will going through with it. All the pain and humiliation i suffered when i was young, the pain of being away from my friends, the pain of losing my kid, and the pain of losing my love, my hope is too much to bear any longer.","1"
"my mental state was neglected by my parents up till my breakdowns became worse and they finally believed me. started by going to my GP, then to a therapist, guidance counsellor, psychiatrist (where i was medicated for a year), and finally a psychotherapist and CBT. None of them made any improvement on my mental stability or intrusive thoughts, only showed me how to bottle it better and keep it better hidden. ive experiemented with drugs and none of them other than mdma made me feel any bit better.when is it time to call it quits and accept that it doesnt get better?","1"
"Im huge into music and Ive been listening to one of my favorite bands, La Dispute, since their announcement of new music.

"We all have another voice in our head who hates us. Who puts us down tries to sedate us. Who likes to cuss and make a fuss and overall you dont like him much and he doesnt like you. Its a voice I hear. Im no stranger to the fear of his word inside my head, but I hear him clear. A clear as I hear your words. Vibrating in your head as you read these words that form from my head to yours. My own translated to a phone, from to me to you to me I am gone. Left escribed on a wall of text. A wall of thought. That is heard as loud as sound thats brought and you hear a voice as loud as silence in drought on a rainless season. You wonder what is wrought, ask now or maybe not, close your ears or your eyes.  Maybe instead you just getIMaybe just get I need help and so do you so do i. But a voice I hear wondering why.. Maybe I should say why not. ","1"
"I don't even know why I ended up here. But I'm sure about one thing, and that's definitely that I love expressing my feelings.I'm feeling dead every night; especially around 02:00-05:00 where I just listen to sad musics, do nothing but cry, try to kill myself, while I post about my depression on my social media accounts seeing my family doing nothing but seeing me suffering hurts me even more, so many people I care about probably even forgot my existence while I want to end my life fearing there could be an afterlife which scares me even more, I don't wanna go to a hell or whatever, I just wanna die and not existOn the other side i wanna have a failed suicide attempt just so my family cares about me again or go back in time and not drop out of school All I do is staying at home laying in my bed and fearing that my parents would ever find out anything which would make everything worse wishing i could have an ok looking face so I could ever be i  any kind of relationship Watching my cousins becoming successful while I'm jobless and doing noting but harming my parents wasting their money thinking my dead would help them way more than my existence everyone i ever cared for slowly disappeared mostly because I was just acting stupid, and I can't even hate myself more for being depressed in an age of 16 while other people loose their parents in a war and have been going through more than I ever did but don't post about their problems I mostly cry remembering the good old 2012 where I was sleeping at my friends , playing Playstation 2 together , going out, having way less problems than now, actually being in a school and not realizing how good I had it, sometimes i just can't remember things up to 40-60 minutesdon't know why I'm writing all of this, just wanna make my first ever post on reddit and let it all outI just wanna take a pill and vanish from existence,goodnight Reddit ","1"
"Hi everybody,I'm a 34 year old male who has been dealing with depression since I was a child and I absolutely hate myself. I've been on a couple dozen medications and dealt with just as many doctors, counselors and therapists. I've also been hospitalized for attempted suicide twice in my life.I don't consider myself as having any real worth as a person. I have a physical reaction, similar to cringing, when anyone says something nice about me. I give suicide serious consideration at least a few times a week and have just general, ""I should kill myself"" thoughts multiple times a day. There are times when I look in the mirror and feel a very real urge to punch the person I see there.I don't feel that life is worth living. At best I distract myself for a few hours at a time, playing games, hanging out with friends or just getting high and watching wrestling. But even during the best of these times the sudden feeling of absolute despair can just come out of seemingly nowhere, as if I just tripped into a hole I didn't see coming.I can't imagine a future in which I don't kill myself. The thought of living another 30 years is disgusting. I can really only come up with two satisfactory reasons not to kill myself, aside from the natural fear of the pain/death, and they're both financial responsibilities to people close to me.And yes, there are people close to me. I care about these people and I accept as fact that they care about me, and when I'm spending time with them is when I feel the best. But I also feel resentful, because I feel like I need to have a babysitter to not be absolutely miserable. Which of course makes me not want to spend time with people to spite myself.On rare occasions, I feel like maybe I can have a future career, home, relationship hobby, whatever, but then I stop and ""realise"" how much those things would be wasted on me and how I shouldn't bother because I would just screw it up, ruin it, or it just wouldn't work for some reason that would obviously be my fault.I don't really have any questions and I'm not asking for advice or help. I just felt like writing out my situation for strangers to read.And if you did, then thanks.","1"
"i wanna kill myself, like really really would like to jump off an elevated place, but not die what do i do? drugs? fall from somewhere not far above the ground(like a 4meters jump)? you know, i'd just like to die but i have a gr8 life other than that (I have different lives in two different countries, just want to kill myself in one)","1"
"I could be broken up with by 1000 different people and none of it would be hitting as hard as this. A couple months ago I told him i couldn't go on with our friendship, my anxiety and depression was getting so bad and i thought he was to blame, instead of talking it through with him I just called off years of our friendship like that. After seeing him at a party recently, well everything has been fucked since. I can't sleep or think normally and my heart feels like it's going to explode any fucking second. I spent my whole life with this person, we went through puberty and every other milestone together, we know every detail of eachothers lives and every small detail and every like, dislike and pet peeve. And now I have nobody.  ","1"
"Sometimes my brain just starts telling me how awful and useless and pathetic I am. Like my brain says things to me like youre pathetic, nobody loves you, you should go kill yourself over and over and it wont shut up.

"I don't know what's wrong with me, but I've had self esteem issues for my entire life. It seems almost comforting to shove myself down and think nothing of myself.

What's wrong with me, why do I hate myself so much?","1"
"Im very new to reddit, keep in mind Im writing this one mobile. Before I start let me give you an idea who I am. Im Hispanic, male, a junior in high school, overweight (210) 54 in height, Im autistic and am diagnosed with aspergers, so forgive my incoherent writing, I also have mood disorder and adhd Im also currently 17. I know for a fact that Im relapsing. Im normally a neutral feeling person. Not happy, not sad, just blank. Back in 2015-2016 I was in my freshman year at this highschool thats infamous for all of these preppy rich kids. Very few minoritys, and if you were one, you were mostly poor. I had been bullied and had been an outcast since well I started school since kinder. Stupid I know. I have a loving family, Im privileged as hell, shit I own all generations of Xbox consoles, but do keep in mind I worked and saved for those things. Anyways back to the point. I was still crushed over these two girls that rejected me back in 8th grade. And I was in swimming, forgot to mention that. I was slow as hell but I lost a shit ton of weight. Anyways I was super bad at algebra 1. Part of it was a combination of a bad teacher and a bad student. But Im willing to take most of the blame. One of the things this fucker of a teacher did was held me during lunch (keep in mind this was for winter finals) was ask me what does Y in Y=mx+b Stand for? For a whole lunch period (45 or 50 minutes) I sat their and never knew the answer. The bell rang and he said with a jackass smirk, y equals slope. So later on I failed the algebra winter exam and I got swimming (1st period) replaces with two periods of credit/algebra 1 recovery (1st and 2nd period). I was being bullied verbally, mentally, and emotionally, by people I thought I could trust. I had small mental breakdowns earlier in the year but I kept it to myself. Due to my failing grades, my parents took away all of my privileges, phone, games, etc... I was losing my mind. Id sit in my room all day and day dream about those two girls. You know of that viral video MEMEME, remember when he almost catches the girl he lost but she falls? Thats exactly what it felt like. Except I was fighting for something I never had to begin with. One day I snapped. It was around February. I had enough of it. I wrote a hit list and threatened to kill certain staff (that fucker teacher) and select students. I wrote evil things with demonic essence. My demons had taken over. I was moron and told someone about it, which in turn somehow got to a parent and they told the school. Now I wouldnt be in the position I live now if earlier a school tragedy happened. Technically it wasnt the schools problem, as the kid was long gone from the district, but he killed himself. The school took this deeply and bad enough I got harassed for not going to this kids funeral. I believe due to the suicide the school had an adverse reaction to my threats. So my best friend and his mom take me to go eat hot dogs one day, during when we eat, the vice principal would visit my apartment and tell my parents about the hit list. My parents were shocked and my dad almost fainted. Later that night my parents said they had to take me to a hospital for blood work. Blood work at 9 at night, right after I ate? Whatever. Too bad I didnt question it. I was put in a emergency room and then the question came. Did you want to kill anyone? Of course I cried and said no. But in reality and in the current day, I wish I said yes or that I did commit such an act.  I wouldnt  be alive or I would be behind bars where I truly belong I was submitted in a mental hospital for 10 days. Where I got more trauma than I got help. Then IOP for 3 grueling months. I was such an outcast that I had a dream about aliens, which signifies that I feel like an outsider to the situation Im in. I finally got out and finished my rest of the semester. But then came court and the trials. It was a unnerving process. But I came out as innocent and had parole for 6 months and did 8 hours of community service. Keep in mind I was labeled as a terrorist due to the act I planned to commit.  I went to an ok private school than I moved to a  public school, which is the one Im at now. Everything would be fine after that. Granted the private school fucked up my credits and I took junior classes as a sophomore. Now Im a junior and taking sophomore classes . Its awful. So much immaturity. The only classes that are junior are English and math models (technically credit recovery for algebra 1). Now on to the modern day. For that past month my sleep has been rocky. I gained all the weight back but Im attempting to lose it as much as I can. My dad almost kicked me out of the house. I constantly visit some of my former teachers when I was a sophomore at this new school Im currently at. I came around the 2nd semester. But I feel like any of the school staff I pour my heart to I feel like Im bothering in some form or way. Just today my choir teacher (this is my first time ever in choir) said we were having a fundraiser for kids with not so great home life. I kinda got triggered. I wanted to cry but I kept the tears inside. Sometimes I wonder if I ever suffer enough? Ya know? Like I feel like depression and getting abused verbally, mentally and emotionally isnt really suffering? But what do I know right? Im a terrorist, a juvenile delinquent.  I constantly talk to my counselor (bless her) and the school psychologist (bless her too). I feel like Im getting nowhere. Just before the thanksgiving break (I live in the U.S, specifically in Texas), I had emailed them both about my home situation. I cried like a bitch in front of them both and looking at it I feel like a pathetic sack of shit who should be crying.The psychologist got extremely worried due to my extreme sadness and being so low. I feel like the counselor and the psychologist are disgusted with that they have to deal with. But thats I what I feel and theyre both great people who do their job right. I grow tired of caring for school. The other day I fell asleep in geometry and the teacher lectured me about if youre going to use this class to sleep than I will make a parent teacher conference. What a dick. Im like one out of 4 kids who dont give a flying fuck anymore and yet they dont get pestered on. As for today, I feel like shit and have considered just skipping school. It never really truly teaches you about life. I told some teachers before the break that I might not come back to school due to my situation. They all felt sorry. One got extremely worried (bless her heart) and cared. My parents love me, but theyre my parents, not my friends. Theyre people I have to legally live with for the time being. I feel sad with no clear feeling of motivation. Ive considered just dropping out but Im not sure. After the events I went through, I have no clue who I am anymore...","1"
"I am living a good life. Somehow I haven't been happy for 2 months now. Each day it's getting worse. Today I couldn't even get out of bed. Some people called me, but I don't feel like answering.

"I go through bouts of extremely extremely low self esteem, and it's absolutely brutal. Being out in public is like torture, and I can't focus very well on things because my mind is racing with negative thoughts about how horrible my appearance is. I can't describe the feeling but it's so bad. The hatred I have for my body, while knowing it's the only one I'll ever have shatters me. I'm stuck in this repulsive body. Every step is pure shame. It's this horrible dreadful feeling, I can physically feel it in my stomach. It weighs me down. It gets so bad that I don't even want to leave the house, it puts too much stress on my mind being out where people can see me. I literally feel so ashamed I feel I should hide away. My opinion of myself is so strong too I don't know if I could ever believe otherwise. ","1"
"Depression level; not even sure how to start this, or even if anyone will read/reply. Figured a flashy title would at least draw a click or two. For the record, yes, acute lymphoblastic leukemia type B.Mine has been a life that I loathe revealing to others. Whether too fucked up or too unbelievable, anytime I reveal any part of myself to someone I care for it seems to drive them away. To the point where I'm at now; 29, estranged from family with no real friends. I started this with the intent to do my first full 'this was my life' confessional, just to see if there was anyone, anywhere, who could understand. This will likely be a long read, consider yourself warned.The setting; early nineties white privileged suburbia. My mother was a horrendous addict, and my father an emotionally dim alpha male. Though he did well providing for my sister and I financially, that was really it. One of my first memories is of waking up to him dragging me down the stairs and outside through the mud, because I had accidentally left a hose on earlier that day, and then shitting myself with terror as he screamed at me. Another is of my mother crashing her car into the side of our house because she was so fucked up on pain killers and god knows what else.Around age ten, she abandoned my sister (she was five at the time) and I, after she had cleaned house of any and all valuables. This included some of our treasured playthings. It was like a giant black 'X' was then placed on us, the neighborhood parents didn't want their kids to be exposed to either of our hurt, confused, mortified selves. We didn't hear from her for years to come.Growing up, I was never allowed to pursue things I wanted. Unless it involved sportsball or anything ultra physical literally everything I liked was ridiculed or flat out denied to me by my father. I'm a total nerd, full blown tabletop/video/literary roleplay gamer. I had to hide my video games, my dungeons and dragons stuff, what few manga/anime things I could get my hands on, hell even mere books and comics. I was yelled at, for reading. Joke was on him when I was in an accident that fucked my knee up permanently, and left me with a ghastly facial wound. He could forget any sort of sport anything after that.Never performed well in school, even as a child I couldn't summon enough fucks about whatever was being lectured. I daydreamed, and didn't talk much to others. Never had any close friendships, quite the opposite really. Had more bullies than friends, even was suspended from middle school when I finally snapped at one in the middle of class. Teacher turned on me like I was at fault, and stupid scared embarrassed me threatened to kill everyone in the classroom before breaking down into tears and running from class. Days later I was escorted from campus in handcuffs.High school was much worse. My freshman year started so well it seemed. Made a couple friends quick, didn't do to well in classes as usual but at least I had people I clicked with. Then I started to get ill. It was strange, I had no appetite but was gaining incredible amounts of weight. Lethargy gripped me constantly, and soon so did large splotchy bruises from literally nothing. My father accused me of hording and hiding food, and denied any plea of unwellness I had made.Finally I began vomiting water I had just drank, and we went to the ER. This was a big deal, because it was valentine's day and god forbid my father had to cancel a date with his woman of the month. To this day I still remember my blood being drawn, and seeing this purple sludge fill the syringe instead. Less than a month after my fifteenth birthday, I was diagnosed with cancer.Chemotherapy for childhood leukemia is very aggressive, but for reason; back then it was the only option. It was that or the cancer. My first few weeks I nearly died from my kidneys (and thus everything else) shutting down, and again months later from a chemo-induced seizure that of course occurred on Christmas. I spent the next year mostly hospitalized, with only nurses and the occasional volunteer for company. Father was always too busy with work, and sister dependent on him to come into the city and see me. My new friends were absent.I had the usual assortment of aunts, uncles, cousins, grandparents etc. Only one pair of aunt/uncle came to visit, and they were just passing through town. The only light in that time, was in the first true friend I ever made. We'll call her Joy, for that's what she was.Joy was the only other person near my age with the same diagnosis. Sweet, caring and personable, we were both oft too sick to see one another in person, but we talked on the phone almost daily. Anytime one of us was well enough to walk though, you'd find us in the other's room down the hall. I fell in love for the first time, and never said anything. She died later that year. Her cancer won. To this day, I wish it had been me instead. The years that followed are a blur of chemo, the usual shitty experiences social rejects face in high school, and a newfound hell that was compulsive lying to my family. To the point where I was GRATEFUL my grandfather passed, just to shift attention from me. Life was a constant torrent of pain, angst, and loathing for myself and everyone near me. You hear heroic tales of people overcoming their cancers and going out to do amazing things. I was not one of these cases. I sucked at being a survivor. And by 18 that's what I was. I somehow managed to graduate, even if it was a summer late. Much to my father's chagrin. He pushed me to go to college, but at the time the idea of more fucking classes when I had just cheated death was terrible. I just wanted to relax, maybe actually enjoy life a little. By now I had made a couple good friends, people who were good to me that I ultimately betrayed out of envy.One of them even helped me move out, let me stay with him and his family for a few months before I was going to start culinary school. That was until my mother resurfaced. She had moved to live near her parents a couple states away, and still struggled with addiction. Never admitted it, but her family told me everything. On top of that, she was diagnosed with a rare auto-immune disorder, and needed help navigating day to day life. I in my infinite wisdom, decided to move there to help her and reconnect with that side of the family. And in the process, had forsaken all of my father's side. Including my little sister.It was dysfunctional, but for the first time I felt I had family that cared. Too ignorant to realize my mother still used, I was blinded by home cooked meals, heart to hearts and other maternal frivolity that I had missed my whole life. Even had sunday dinner with the grandparents, cousins, my favorite uncle, and his wife who had always detested me for being my mother's son.I met a girl, fell in love, and even started going to college to study my ultimate passion; creative writing. I'm still in debt thanks to the useless but lovely couple years I spent pursuing my passion. The girl and I got out first apartment together, adopted a couple cats, and seemed to have a normal, pleasant life. We grew very close to a group of friends, one even becoming my best and most trusted outside the girlfriend.Her and I dealt with my mother relapsing over and over, dealt with our mess of trust issues, anxiety and depression. Smoked weed, screwed like rabbits, and reveled in being alive. It wasn't a perfect life, but it was the happiest I had been. Until my mother snapped with a midlife crisis, revealed her bipolar disorder, and was hospitalized after totally shutting down. She died weeks after release from the psychiatry ward from a sudden heart attack. Our last conversation was meant to be a prelude for an argument against her new clearly unstable boyfriend.Weeks later, I found out my girl and my best friend had been screwing behind my back. And all my friends knew. Only one came forward. My mum's side of the family all but abandoned me. They were all devastated from the loss too, and none had any time for me I guess. I tried to swallow a bottle of xanax one night, but chickened out. The next several months are a blur or work, booze and bud. I had a work buddy, and a couple friends in other states I had met gaming over the years, but that was really it. When I lost my job, due to drinking on the clock, I was simply over everything. One of my gaming friends, someone I had grown to trust, offered me a fresh start in a new state. I moved in with her and her fiance, also a gaming friend. They've seen me now at my best, and at my worst, and haven't seemed to scare off. I love them, and miss them. Though we'll still see a movie together maybe once every six months or so, they're now married and on that family building grind. I don't blame them, and do cheer them the fuck on from afar. Won't deny the sickening bubble of envy that rises every time I have to be around them.Had a girl for a couple years, and it was the gentlest, most loving relationship I had ever experienced. She was way out of my league, biomedical engineering major, ballroom dancer, and overall ray of sunshine. Great gal it seemed, only for her to one day admit that our relationship was holding her back. I was a good man, she said. But felt I could be a great one someday. For someone else.This was a blessing in disguise. I had friends that helped me get through that break up, got my own apartment, had reliable work as a cook and even began to reconnect with my father and sister. Who have both grown drastically, to the point where I don't even recognize them anymore. In a positive way. Even began to exercise and lost a lot of weight. So wrapped up in my internal crap over a lifetime, I was simply in denial over my 300lb+ self.For the next couple years to follow, I found myself in a spiritual renaissance. I was the fittest I had ever been, found some semblance of faith in myself, others, and the universe, even adopted a cat. My friends were few, but accepting of my quirks and general preference for solitude. I was as close to happy and at peace as I had ever been. I wrote constantly, even began drafting plans for my first novel when I mostly stuck to prose. Still wanted female attention, but despite my best, most embarrassing efforts nothing has come of it. The closest was with one of these friends, a girl I mostly played Destiny with who lives in the next state. For a summer we talked constantly, revealed things to each other we normally wouldn't to anyone else, and admitted some attraction. She always told me to have no expectations, but I let my heart and dick get the better of me and fell for her. It was apparently not mutual after all. We barely talk now and when we do it's that horrible shallow small talk I'm sure we all know and hate.My other friends have all but vanished too, busy with their own lives and relationships. Now hanging out usually means having to be the third wheel with my friends. I'd rather be alone than a third wheel, so here I've begun to find myself increasingly reclusive. I lost a job, which I didn't mind cause it was a very toxic environment, but the following job hunt and couple weeks unemployed has slain my meager savings. I've found another gig, but it's more of the same grind I can barely stand.I'm finding myself broke, lonely, and stressed as we enter the holiday season- a time I've never handled well. I spend every holiday alone, only ever invited by my father who is half the country away. It kills me every time one of my new associates asks 'OH HEY YOU GOING TO YOUR MOM'S FOR [insert holiday]?'.I never know how to reply to those. Can't just be all 'I would love to, but her lifetime of bad decisions I emulate on the regular ultimately led to her heart fucking failing and now I panic about this very thing only every few minutes.', or 'I'd spend it with friends, but my reclusive nature and distrust of everyone near me prevents that. Oh and none of them ever invite me so there's that.'Literally the past couple months, my social experiences have been the once or twice a week gaming session with that one friend I mentioned, and another who I want to like. But naturally since it seems there's a thing between him and her even that is turning into third wheel crap.Everything I love is falling apart. This is literally the most I've written all year I think. Even then I've reread, edited, and hated every word that's been put down. I'm frustrated with myself physically, still in the best shape I've ever been but between loose skin and the fact that there's STILL fucking fat despite the work I put I still look like a husky fuck. And as I stare down the big three-oh in a little over a month, I have to admit... I think I'm done. Not just this, which I've spent the past couple hours typing up. I shudder to think how long it would've taken had I delved deeper into the fuckery that is my life.I think I'm done living. Everyday I wake up just as tired as when I went to bed. Each work out is a goddam trial to motivate for and complete, only to feel it's pointless after. I'm terrible at talking to people in general, let alone women, so my social life shouldn't even be called that. I don't hate my new job, but I'd so much rather not be there.The one thought that I have more than anything else lately... is the title. Not just that it had won, but Joy had lived. That my family and friends would've been spared the shit presence that was myself in their lives. That my miserable existence would've ended earlier. That I won't have to spend another birthday alone.I'm a coward, and can't bring myself to end things. I secretly wish for death, like a car or meteorite to hit me. A way out of this institution that is America in its 20-teens.If you read this, I thank you. If it goes ignored, well, I wouldn't be surprised. At the very least I feel empty instead of internal agony after writing this.","1"
"Hello,I don't really feel like I mean much. I've been depressed for about 5 years now (currently 20yo), with some breaks in between but during those times I felt ""neutral"" at best. I've always been the outsider of the group. I've always been the guy who has to stand just outside the circle, or walks just behind the rest. I'm not the most talkative person but that can't be the reason people always give me weird looks, right? Do I act weird and just don't notice it? Do I walk or talk or look weird? I don't think I'm a bad looking guy, not really handsome or anything, but good enough. Yet I never get the feeling people actually care about me, or even see me as on of their own.I guess my autism is just too noticeable. Because yeah, that's what I have. I know it's a bit of a meme, but to be serious, it does seriously damage your ability to socialize. I want to have friends and a girlfriend as much as the next guy, but I'm just so terrible at holding up long-term and close relationships. I can't hold a conversation properly, or even look someone in the eye for more than a second. I'm so awful at conveying emotion that I just come across as a soulless, boring weirdo. And well, that is really what I am. I just can't get myself to care about socializing anymore, but at the same time I hate not being able to socialize. I'm just tired of being the outcast, of getting all those weird looks. I want to actually have fun with life, without constantly fucking myself over with my autistic tendencies. I just wish I was normal.","1"
"Assuming they love you back. Why are you depressed then?I always feel like if someone loved me my depression would be so much less terrible. Or maybe it's my depression telling me that.I have a decent number of friends. I just.. don't feel anything for anyone. I don't feel a connection with anyone. I just feel so lonely all of the damn time. I feel so empty all the time unless I'm preoccupied with something else. Maybe it's because I'm not comfortable around.. anyone. I feel like if I make one mistake they instantly start to hate me and start looking for people to replace me with. I wish I was comfortable around people. I wish I could be myself without fear of everyone leaving me. I just hate being alone. I hate that ive been wasting my time on someone who doesn't even want me in their future. I hate feeling like everyone is being insincere with me literally all of the time. I hate feeling fine for a while and then just every so once in a while feeling like I'd make everyone else's life better if I just liked myself. I just want to be happy. More than anything. Why is it so fucking hard. What the fuck is wrong with me. It's so painful. No one actually cares about me. I could kill myself right now and people would only be upset because I'm not there to buy them shit, or because I ruined their idea of what a family should be like, Im constantly disappointing people without even trying to. I wish someone would just be proud of me for.. something. But no. I'm just a stupid piece of shit who's not good at anything. There's always someone better than me. I'm never good enough for anyone. It'd be one thing if I wasn't trying but I am, and that makes me feel so much more pathetic. If I'm going to continue to feel this pain I just want to end it. All I want is love. Acceptance. That's all I ever fucking wanted. Everyone else gets it except for me. I'm just a sidepiece in everyone's life. I'm insignificant to everyone. No one would care. No one would miss me.I hate myself.

"Yeah I'm 17. I'm kind of ""drifting"" through school at the moment.When I'm busy through the day, I don't give it too much thought. It's when I come home, every night when I sit in bed. When the mind is idle it wanders and I start to consider whether living is worth it or not. I want to join the Army and escape from this hell I'm in but that's two years ahead, way too long. And even after that, then what? Go to college and become a slightly better nobody with a slightly better paying job? I sometimes feel like it's too hard to go to school, get out of bed, wake up alive the next morning. I don't want to deal with this world. I never consented to being born, I don't want to go tomorrow and deal with my problems. I don't want to eat the same old oatmeal, I'd rather eat a bullet. My parents say I have an IQ of 135 but I certainly don't feel that way. I don't feel alive, I don't know what happened, but I've been like this for the last two years. I don't enjoy the things I used to anymore, and I'm starting to see life as it really is. Bleak and desolate and dead.The more time goes by, the more ""happy"" people I see... The more I want to put a bullet in my head and end it all.","1"
"Really anything.I'm in a very poor place right now. I feel like there's nothing I can do and I'm afraid to have to work to get better at it.  I think I'm afraid that I will start, spend precious times of my life on it only to fail.  Usually, if I don't achieve something in a short time, I start feeling horribly unmotivated and depressed.I have trouble making friends because it doesn't happen immediately.I don't want to go back to college because I'm afraid I'll fail.I even saw a ""positive"" post from someone talking about how they're getting over there depression, but I just saw the words ""it'll be a long process"" and froze up.I don't know what to do.","1"
"This is going to be a long rant(im on mobile, sorry if formatting is weird).I'm a 16 year old male and I live in a group home. I feel like all the other kids here hate me. I guess I'm not very likeable because I'm nothing like the rest of them. I am roomates with a kid who speaks very little English and he is an asshole, but there is nothing I can do about it. He is 18. He uses his phone late at night unmuted and talks loudly to his girlfriend. He also does a lot of other things that are rude like not closing the door when he leaves the room, playing his music really loud, and hanging stuff off my bed. I don't like him and there isn't anything I can do about it. I could tell him what I don't like but I doubt anything would change. I thought that I would try to be an asshole to him back because it seemed like a good idea at the time. I decided not to close the door when I left the room and that made him pissed off like I thought it would. He came out and told me to close the door when I leave and I told him suck my dick, so he punched me. I, being a little bitch, did nothing back and didn't tell any of the staff. That obviously left me feeling like shit because I brought it upon myself. I know this sounds really whiny. Tonight, he was moving the bed to clean under it( it's a bunk bed and I'm on the top) and he had no problem moving the bed while I was on it. When he moved it back he told me to get off the bed and I told him no. He cussed at me in his language and I cussed at him back. I didn't know why he wanted me to get off the bed. He then told one of the staff here that speaks his language that I objected to his cleaning and cussed him out. One of other staff that thinks I'm a liar because I gave him conflicting times for an event I wanted to go to(and other reasons), asked me for my side of it. I at first didn't think anything of what had just happened, so I told him nothing happened. Then he talked to me more and I finally told him my side of the story. He didn't believe me of course, because I'm an untrustworthy liar and I was changing my story. Then the other staff came in and told me that I have been poking at my roomate for a while now and that he is not someone I should mess with. They both believed what he said and made me feel like garbage. I've been crying a lot lately hating myself and everyone around me. I know that people care about me, like my friends who are trying to get me out of the group home to live with them, and my sister. Reading this entire thing it sounds like I'm just whining over nothing and that I am actually an asshole. Maybe I am, nobody in this house likes me. I feel like I should just die because then I wouldn't get in anyone's way and people wouldn't have to deal with me anymore. I'm a piece of shit. I'll probably delete this later. Thanks for sitting through my incoherent garbage.","1"
"I am 25 and I lost the girl of my dreams about two years ago. Our relationship was probably one of the most dysfunctional ones out there. On the surface we seemed like the ideal couple, and to each other it seemed that way as well. We were either both blind or both in denial of course. Well the delusion finally ended, as few lies ever remained buried forever. It pains me to even think about her, to the point that sometimes I feel a pain in my chest. People tell me to just get out there, and I will get over her, and it will pass with time. All I can say is, I hope I just get hit by a bus, because that seems much more likely. I think of her daily still and not even because I go looking for grief. I wake up and think about her. She was everything for me. It feels like I am losing a grip on my sanity. Its funny, I never thought much of how people go crazy.. well not until recently. The worst thing is, I still love her now and there is not a thing I can do now.","1"
"All my life my parents have been so adamant about me going to college. My mom is threatening to kick me out of her house if I don't go. I'm a 17 year old male senior in high school and I have a girlfriend but I don't even know if she loves me. I try to look to the future and see what I have to work towards but now it just seems like I go to college and spend the rest of my life paying student loans. I'm starting to wonder what the point of it all is. I don't even have my learner's permit yet and I'm almost 18. All I do in my free time is play destiny 2. I've been kicked out of clans over and over again because I'm an asshole apparently. I feel like a fucking loser and I don't know what the fuck to do with my life. My parents made me get a job to pay for college and I haven't taken my ACT yet. My dad bought the online training program for it but I just can't focus when I use it. I don't know what to do. I'm lost. If I was to be asked where I saw myself in 5 or 10 years, I'd say that I have no idea because I can't see myself going anywhere or being anything. I am told that I'm smart by several people, I am in all honors courses in high school. I still feel like a piece of shit. I think about dying every day and I can't bring myself to do it. I have no friends to talk to. I've always been the outcast. I still haven't found something I'm good at. I need help. I feel like a hollow shell of a human.If anyone has advice, please put it in the comments.","1"
"Everyday I wake up feeling horrible about myself. I feel like I dont find happiness in anything, even when I have things I should be extremely grateful for. Im doing well in school, have friends that I talk to on a regular basis, and my family is very loving. No trauma or anything of that sort and Im even decently confident, I just dont see anything worthwhile. I dont know who I should talk to either. Everyone has their own struggles and I feel like I shouldnt put the stress on them if I express how horrible I feel all the time. I truly feel like I would have more suicidal thoughts if I didnt have such a loving family, where I am the only one holding us together at times. Of course my friends/family will care for me but I feel selfish to put my issues in their hands. I have thought about visiting a counselor at my college but purposely avoid it because I dont want to break down in front of someone. I cry myself to sleep most nights fantasizing about driving to my familys property in the country and shooting myself. Regardless if you post any advice, thank you for reading this. I feel like this helps even if its internet strangers. ","1"

"Hi guys. So my ex broke up with me because she felt she wasn't good enough and couldn't love me like I love her. She said she needed space and it has been really tough trying not too break the NC. I wrote a letter saying how I appreciated the two months we spent together and what a wonderful person she was and how I am still there for her. She later emailed saying to leave her alone and that the letter actually made her feel bad. I don't quite know what I'm looking for but was I in the wrong here? Should I just have said nothing? Felt like I needed to write it to get closure for myself.","1"

"Im just having a really hard time tonight. I feel like Ive been off for a while, slowly regressing. And I didnt want to admit it because I was doing so well. But something is definitely wrong. My suicidal thoughts are slowly creeping back. And I know this feeling, I know these thoughts. I had them for far too long and I dont want them anymore. Its even harder because I know I should be happy. Things are going well for me, objectively,  but I cannot be objective. Im stuck inside my own head and its torture. Escapism isnt an option. Its like Im trapped inside of a movie theater where theyre showing video of my worst mistakes and theres audio of myself just listing everything I hate about myself and everything thats wrong with me. I sincerely dont know what to do. I have no one to talk to about this. No one around me has or has had depression. They dont understand nor want to listen. My good friends are far away. Im not close with my family. Its just getting really hard. Im scared Im going to go back to my sanity of 3 years ago and I really do not want to go back there. Im genuinely frightened. ","1"
"Hey y'all. So, after about a year of being off drugs (quit lexapro after an on-again-off-again relationship for quite some time. I need my orgasms - sorry.) I'm giving Wellbutrin a chance. The internet makes it seem like a magic pill: nothing but weight loss and energy and rainbows and sex drive for days! BUT. Now I'm getting nervous about side effects - specifically, tinnitus. My mother just informed me she briefly took wellbutrin (generic XR 150 mg, same stuff i got) and noticed an increase in tinnitus. Granted, she said that she had already had mild tinnitus anyway and is super sensitive to side effects in most medications, but its got me worried, as she also said her sister has tinnitus, so clearly its a family/genetic thing. I work in radio and most of my job is editing audio, so I would kind of like to not permanently fuck up my ears.I realize everyone reacts differently etc etc but have y'all experienced tinnitus on Wellbutrin? If so, when did it show up/what dosage were you on/did it ever go away/how intense was it? I want to know what to be on the lookout for. If not - I wanna know too! Or any other side effects you may have had. Or wonderful experiences as well! Just trying to be an informed consumer, I guess. My biggest fear is messing up my hearing :(","1"
"When I started this subreddit years ago, I was in a dark place. I felt alone and afraid and unwelcome most anywhere I went. I truly started it as a haven where I knew I would be accepted as it was a place of my own creation. However, since then, much has happened and I've grown a lot, learned a lot, and healed a lot. In that time, however, I also forgot many things- one being this subreddit. I found this once again by accident this evening and am honestly shocked and amazed at how it's grown. While I'm saddened to see so many people suffering from the horrible affliction that is mental illness, I'm also delighted to see so much support and banding together in such a tough situation. I also, however, see the need for an active moderator on a subreddit which hosts some of the most vulnerable going through the most difficult situations. For my absence, I am sorry. While I cannot say I will return and be that moderator (as I neither have the time and it would be detrimental to my own mental health), I can tell you I will work to find the appropriate replacement who will both reinvigorate this subreddit and act as a shield to potentially harmful content and information. It is truly a pleasure to be in the presence of so much love and support. Please continue your efforts, and may you all heal quickly. Thank you for trusting me and this subreddit as somewhere you can call home when there's nowhere else. ","1"
"Hi all! I'm rtmiu. I'll be taking over as mod for the time being.Around two and a half years ago, Wulfy and I met and grew close. We were both in fairly dark places in our lives, but we helped each other through it. At some point during that, we thought that others might be helped by the same thing, so Wulfy made /r/depression_help. They looked after it too (even when it was empty), but as life went on and took over, we got preoccupied and eventually forgot. We're both sorry about that.But the greatest thing about this place is that it managed to grow without us; even through your collective pain, stigma and struggles, you managed to make this community thrive and be there for each other. I thank you all and am inspired by your kindness and generosity. You embody the collective strength of the human spirit.That said, this subreddit isn't without issues, or toxicity. As a mod I'll do my best to listen to everyone and keep out any hate or antagonism.  Feel free to tell me if anything is wrong, or right! I wish you all the best :)","1"
"This week I declined an invitation to a social event with a couple of my best friends that's today, because I'm having a really bad episode. Now I get pictures of them being together in our WhatsApp group and that hurts so bad. I'm also pissed that they don't even ask how I am, even though I didn't tell them why I didn't come. And I'm angry they get to have fun while I'm by myself in bed, not even able to cry. And I'm angry at myself for feeling like this, cause all I'd have to do is tell even just one of them what's going on with me, but I'm too proud to do so. It's frustrating and I feel alone and cast out. Can anyone relate and how do you get yourself together in moments like this? ","1"
"The past few months (last few weeks of high school for me) were a shitstorm. I tried so hard to keep up being motivated and happy, but every time these short bursts of happiness in my life end in disaster (I know I sound dramatic here but it really does feel like the universe is against me). I used to be so happy last year (or at least seemed like I was recovering, there were episodes but stilll). But the more shit happens, the further away everyone feels. Nobody wants to be around a party pooper. I shouldn't expect my friends to care for me when I'm in need but I can't get rid of the bitterness that remains. I hate that I tried so hard to be a good friend to them when they couldn't be the same to me because 'A' levels came around. I cared for my two best friends so much. Wrote them letters, drew funny drawings, wrote light-hearted poems but I know I'm the only one trying. I hate myself for being selfish in expecting my love to be reciprocated and sometimes I hate myself for even trying. I sacrificed so much of myself to be with them. But when I needed them they couldn't even sacrifice a few minutes of their day to write a message. Suffice to say, I ended junior college (sixth form, senior year for the international folks) in a really bad place, crying everyday (maybe I'm just a crybaby). It's not that I didn't try to get closure. I tried to talk and resolve things and get closure that fine, they never valued me as a friend. But I miss them so much. They were good friends to me before, even though they deserted me when the almighty final exams came. Sometimes it feels like I was only used (I led and coached our group for our A Level Theatre Studies project). I've tried to reach out to them after the exams, but nothing. Only non-committal answers. But it gets confusing when I ask that maybe we shouldn't even try to make plans anymore then the other party is like ""no! of course I want to go out with you!"". I hate this constant feeling of being a stand-in until a better option has come along (nothing new, been ditched by the same person a few times before). I'm angry at myself for not having seen this earlier, for forgiving them so many times I lost their respect and it only left me being crushed for the last year of high school.To add to that there's shit happening in my home life. Typical stuff  my burgeoning religious conflict with my religious parents, but with enough added risk to make me wish I could run away. As if my own conflict of faith within myself isn't enough there's a lot of (let's just leave it at that) pressure to conform and not think and I feel like I'm getting suffocated by religion and cannot make my own choices. I hope I'm not adding fuel to the negative stereotypes surrounding my religion (I'm Muslim, there's enough as it is). My situation is not representative of all, there are many open-minded families where I live.I do apologise if this sounds like a teen angst rant as I'm writing from a dark corner of my room at 2am. I myself still find it hard to accept my own diagnosis even though I'm on meds lmaoI just wish there's someone out there who feels the same and who's been through similar things, advice on how to get over the constant loneliness. I'm just tired. Nothing is exciting anymore and every time I do something like play the piano or eat some fucking noodles I get reminded about the two best friends I had and become upset. And the painful part is knowing they don't give two shits, not even for happy situations and how easily they cut me off. For who can bear to feel himself forgotten? Most days I just lie in bed fed up and angry and wondering what's wrong with me. I'm tired.","1"
"Hello everyone,It was my birthday today,and like most of them I was sad. Funny thing is I told myself that I will not let this day be like all the others. A few people wished me. It was going good so far, it seem like it was gonna be a good day. My partner didn't text or call me until I did. But, it was because they were not feeling well (sorry I'm trying to be neutral). Anyways, in the evening an argument happened, and now no one's talking. I hate my birthday. I hate being alive. I'm not suicidal, I'm just sad and I feel alone. I'm just so worthless...everyone would be better off without me if I was never born. I just needed to share. Hopefully tomorrow is a better day.Sidenote: Some very close people to me forgot my birthday when I was a child, and this incident today is just opening old wounds.","1"
"Currently sitting on the floor in my kitchen. Drinking whiskey and smokin away the night. I feel uneasy. I have been debating how to reach out to my friends and family. Most of my life i have been a loner. I have my frienda but have always been the odd one floating around as we hang out and its the same with my family and work environment. People seem to be fine qith letting me be me and be by myself. I appreciate the independance but it'd be nice to be recognized. To have my opinion be considered. Im 28 years old and ive tried turning my life around from this behavior but it usually falls apart. I'd like to reach out but my friends are either married and/or have kids. The same goes for my family. I knoq they love me and care for me but i have always felt like a burden so i often stray from them to avoid bothering them. I honestly dont know how to make friends. I usually come off as either an ass or completely aloof. I dont have insurance and cant afford to see a professional. So here i sit on a friday night. Alone on the floor. Feeling everything and no way of letting it out besides this. Ive always felt that living with my depression has been a way for me to feel more connected. That experiencing these feelings is a part of living and that choosing to feel every bit of the weight, the sadness, the emptiness would help me. Help me become more mindful of others. But when im alone as often as i am i just begin to feel hollow. I feel like im a million miles away. I see other people around me and feel like my feet are in concrete and everyone is walkin forward. Im not 100% sure what i want out of life anymore. I play music, i play magic and build models and distract myself with puzzles. I feel confident in my abilities but not confident in myself. As of late all of it feels as though its just biding my time. Theres a lurking shadow over all of it. A shadow that fits like a warm blanket lulling me to think if i just close my eyes for a bit it can let go. I can just quit and not have to worry about anything. It drains me of all ambition. I can be in the middle of a deep conversation that im fully engaged in and then it hits like a light slowly dimming out. I try to recover but its as thought my body cant do anything about it. Basically i'm reaching out. From the floor.","1"
"Anyone have anything I can do to help? My 14yo nephew is depressed and has anxiety, sometimes to the point of physical symptoms (raging headaches and stomach aches that prevent him from doing things, even fun things). He's always been a bit behind the curve developmentally and socially- very introvert and not a lot of friends, only interested in video games. He made friends at a school he was at from kindergarten to 8th grade, but now doesn't have those friends as the all are at different high schools and live quite far. He tries to text them but they are moving on in their life, and he's too introvert to make firends at his new school- high school- first year- not knowing one person. It sucks. What can I do? Anything I can recommend to him? Any websites? What can I say that will sink in to him or mean anything to him? This could get so much worse if something doesn't change. ","1"

"Hi all,I have generalized anxiety, panic disorder, and generalize major depression (think that's what the doc said). I'm going through a really bad episode (started a few days ago; stuck in bed, can't function, crying a lot; this hasn't happened in about a 18 months) and I have a question: is the best approach just to ride it out, or should I be pushing myself?I'd love to hear that this is like the common cold - not much to do other than wait it out. That way I can relax, just focus on feeling ok, and wait to start feeling like I can get back to work.I ask cause right now I feel guilt and pressure that I'm not being productive and doing enough to fight it off. Like, maybe I'm just being lazy. Is it better to try to face things more? Does it help, or am I just doing more harm? I should say that there's no obvious reason for my depression ( e.g. no one died or anything).Sorry if that doesn't make sense. I'll try to be around to clarify things. You thoughts are appreciated.

"Hello from the fire escape staircase of my bf's apartment.. I'm hoping to sit here and be alone, and force myself to give my bf space. But i know if left alone my mental health will deteriorate and i will overthink. So here i am.My bf and I have been fighting on and off the past few weeks. It's taken a toll on our relationship and both our patience. I know i have problems, but so does he. I have issues dealing with separation during times when we argue. He tells me he needs the space, but it always feels like I'm unwanted. He talks to his other friends during this period and i feel inferior because he chooses to talk to them over me. And when i ask him about it, he cusses me out (tells me to fuck off) and i just die/break down internally. He's moving to another country next year.On top of that, i have a well paying job but the environment, people, and culture are horrible - i got told off today because putting up the hood on my hoodie is inappropriate; people change into slippers for comfort in the office so i don't see why i cant? I don't even wear open toed shoes at all during work. I'm trying to stay on top of things despite being hired into a career that's not related to what i study. I think me having a high sense of responsibility and accountabilty makes accomplishing this a nightmare. I applied for another job that would let me move to the country where my bf will be living in, but the results of that will only come out next year. Until then, I've been telling myself I'm in the for the money. I've also been feeling intermittently disassociated, and I'm afraid it'll become a permanent state of being. I'm trying to be happier but it's been harder and harder in general. I find myself wishing more often that a freak accident will occur so i will either be hospitalised or die.Any advice or comments is greatly, greatly appreciated...","1"

"So, the last 3 years have been especially bad even during times when things were going really well in life. I dont want to elaborate on HOW soon but recently Ive had s terrible episode (suicidal thoughts). The day starts with you trying to get out of bed. This is the first step. You cant open your damn eyes. You lay there kind of asking not to be woken up. Why?  No particular reason sometimes. Sometimes something minuscule. You fall asleep. You wake up. Try to do some work from home. You stare st your computer screen. You arent thinking. Your arent moving. Youre in a state of NOTHING. Completely numb to the outside world. You get s text or a call from a friend or family and you are all smiles. You want someone to reach out and hug you but you also dont want anyone to talk to you at all. You WANT to feel the misery. It almost consumes you to the point you just accept it and look up actual painless ways to kill yourself. You scroll through. Sleeping pills?  Perfect. Then you think about the people that would be hurt if you did do this to yourself. And it rips you apart. You start crying because you dont want to hurt the ones you love but you also dont want to be in this suffering anymore. You lay back in your safe place in bed. Try to escape by listening to music or a tv show that makes you happier. You text the suicide hotline just to talk to someone who will listen and you dont have to ever talk to agajn nor see. You lay there till you fall asleep and do it all over again until youre ready to get things done and get back into society.","1"
"So this is my first time doing anything like this so tell me if I did this right. Im an 18 year old male finishing up high school . I had ocd as a child and due to  that going to school was hell, if someone talked in the middle of class it felt like an air horn would be going off. I know it doesnt sound bad at all but this would be going on 10 hours a day. Every weekday for almost 9 years. Needless to say by the time I got to high school I was half crazy I had only my twin (who while not going through the same thing was a good shoulder to lean on) BUT I beat the disorder. All I had left to do was put myself back together, beat the depression hanging over me and burn my social anxiety.  Its been 3 years since then and I feel like Im getting swallowed by my issues. Guys what do I do?","1"

"im back. im a 14 year old girl and life has been very hard right now. There is so much pressure on me lately with school and my parents. School is very hard right now and im barely passing life at home sucks because its always my strict dad yelling at me. He is so fucking unreasonable. I feel like he has nothing better to do so he comes in my room and tries to find reasons to fight with me. He's constantly mad at me for nothing and he is actually so mean and causes me depression. He adds onto everything else in my life. Also everyone has a boyfriend but i am still single but i just rlly want one because i feel like a boyfriend would be the only thing that would make me happy right now. I just    don't want to live anymore. im tired of everyone and everything i want new or i want something that will  make me happy something i will wake up and look forward to. ","1"
"I am in a very low place right now. I'm letting things that shouldn't bother me bug the crap out of me. I just feel like no matter what I do I'm not good enough. It's mostly to do with work, since it affects how I live 24/7. I just feel like I don't fit in, at work, and in this world. I have tried to stay positive but I can't pretend anymore. I'm so good at hiding my feelings that no one knows how I really feel. I always wondered how people can let things get this bad, and while I still don't know I just want to get out of this dark place my mind is stuck in.","1"
"I am a 23 year old grad student in need of advice. Previously I have been diagnosed with major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder but recently I have been experiencing many PTSD like systems as well (night terrors, flashbacks, insomnia etc) during my undergrad years I experienced very traumatic events, luckily the university provided me with a therapists that I would see weekly. Now that my undergraduate is over I live with my parents so I can no longer see my therapist. It has been six months since I last spoke with my therapist and things have become progressively worse. As a result I am now struggling in every aspect of my life. I am in my first semester of graduate school to become an applied behavior analyst. Even though this degree is my dream career I have found it very difficult to meet my deadlines and complete major assignments due to my recent episodes. I dont feel motivated to study or do assignments and often find myself rushing to do assignments hours before they are due. I have recently missed major assignments like my thesis proposal and a few of my classes due to crying spells or extreme apathy.Professors and academic advisors have began sending me emails notifying me that I am failing and I am too afraid to read them. I have often considered faking a death in the family in order to turn in my late assignments and explain my absences but feel bad for not just being honest. I am so angry at myself because I see my dream job being squandered. Lately I have had more frequent night terrors that I am incapable of being woken from (at least by my multiple alarm clocks) as a result I am often late for work causing me to be reprimanded by my bosses. During work I sometimes have flashbacks or throw up (which isnt ideal in a restaurant setting). I have noticed that my hours have declined and I fear my job is in jeopardyI have attempted to find a therapist nearby but after multiple failed attempts a day, I am unable to find someone that takes my insurance for my age range (lots of pediatric and marriage therapist though) so I am beginning to become discouraged. i have asked my mom for help but she is very religious and wants me to work on my spiritual life before considering a therapist. And my father is against labels so he doesnt think its worth the money. i am slowly losing my grip on my responsibilities and find it harder and harder to face each day. Has anyone else had similar experiences or know of any free programs or groups in the Atlanta area? Any suggestions on what I should tell my professors?  Any help is appreciated! TLDR; Due to anxiety, depression, and possible PTSD I am failing in grad school about to lose my job and I am unable to find a therapist nearby. Any advice is needed! ","1"
"Hey, I really need some advice right now, I'm feeling really confused and, quite frankly, kind of scared.So I've been on Prozac for about... a year and a half? Maybe 2? And ever since my 3rd week on it I've been on the rise, the edge was wiped off my depression and everything was just so much easier to cope with. I dealt with a lot of past issues and I didn't want to kill myself anymore, everything was great! But the last month I don't know why, but friends and family have been getting worried about me. At first I didn't understand why at all; I still felt fine, even though I was a little stressed out. It was just stress, normal. But then they started pointing out to me that I'd started to pick up a lot of my old depression habits...The main habits they pointed out were that I've been sleeping waaaay more than usual, I've been eating more and more, and I'm becoming very lethargic, not wanting to go to school, not wanting to go to work, not wanting to do a lot of things.Now at first I thought they were just seeing things, because I still /want/ to do the things I love doing, I still /want/ to do stuff with friends, and I still /want/ to be successful and complete my ambitions... but after they mentioned it I realized that even though I /want/ all of those things... I've just, stopped doing a bunch of them. In the last month, I've been avoiding work shifts, I've been saying I want to go to the gym, but I haven't at all, I've been ignoring he things I know I need to record (I voice act on the side,) and I've been, albeit unconsciously, trying to avoid school as much as I humanly can. I don't want to fail my classes, I really truly don't, but something in me is just... it's losing its drive again. For the first time in my life I'm on the verge of failing a class, even though I keep assuring myself and everyone else that it's only a matter of time before I catch up and I'm fine again, I'm starting to doubt myself... And I'm scared that I'm going to full-blown relapse to my old depression without even realizing it... So that's my predicament. I'm sorry this is such a long post, but I honestly left out more than I told here. I really hope somebody knows what I'm feeling and has some kind of solution or help for me... I really need it. Thanks.","1"
"Hi I'm really new to this site but I've read a few other stories so here goes. I'm a young adult who is suffering from Sevier depression and anxiety. Here lately I'm not sure what happened to my life. I was a fairly normal teen with friends and I even married my hs sweetheart. Now that its been a few years I've battled through everything from being broke on the verge of losing our home being told i can't have kids my spouse cheating and now as soon as things start to come together my only friends won't talk to be probably because I'm a constant downer and they are sick of me my husband always stays pissed off at me my job is about to fire me cause I'm staying sick and it having car troubles and to top it all off my car won't start because of some electrical issues and I don't have the money to fix it. I feel lower then I ever have and honestly if I was so scared if the afterlife is probably kill myself. I just wanna lay in bed and cry my heart out but I know it would do any good 1 cause no one else would care and 2 the voices in my head would only convince my to hurt myself. This is my fry for help.","1"
"I am sitting here crying non-stop for two hours right next to my sleeping man. I feel like no one nears me crying and asking for help when I need it the most. I am there for my friends, my man and my mom, I always stop what I am doing whenever my close people are hurting. But why no one doesn't even bother asking me if I am ok? 3 years ago I left everything and moved from the other part of the world to NYC for someone who I thought was ""the love of my life"" fast forward a year, I am on the curb with my cat because he kicked me out from his apartment after I found out he was cheating. I don't really remember the next 7 months as I was torn between switching one shitty job after another while partying every single night. Moreover, I had to deal with other issues, nagging friends who accused me of being an irresponsible junkie. Here, I want to mention, I am not a saint by any means, I was a functional alcoholic who was popping random pills back in forth, because I just needed to forget myself. But I never let drugs ruin my life neither I did it in front of those who disapproved. The only ""drug"" I will take now is weed, it calms me down and I know it helped me acknowledge and tame my dark side, but I feel like it doesnt help me that much at this point unless I am stoned out of my mind. Things got better with time, I work at a stable job, I started my own business that pays half of my bills but I am miserable that I have to carry it all in my own while being there to support my friends, my man and my family. It just hurts to realize that no one truly gives a shit in this world as long as it is not about them, I get it....And now, I am on a two-week streak where I cry every night because I need a damn hug and someone telling me that everything I do is worth fighting for. I feel that I am all alone and no one will ever notice if I disappear.... l told my man I was upset and that I hate myself, but he didnt seem to pay attention as he deals with his own shit....I am just done pretending I am emotionless strong woman who can do it all and doesn't care about anything and anyone. I am in so much pain...","1"
"I've been told at a such young age that i shouldn't ""Seek attention""  and that I ""shouldn't cry over stupid things."" yet being told all of this at a young age now makes me afraid to seek help because I don't feel right getting attention (even now as i make this post i feel like im doing the wrong thing) and when I cry myself to sleep because of how much Self hate i have i hate myself more for crying, I also refuse to cry in front of others and enclose my sadness into a ball inside and hope it stays there.","1"
"Like everyone else here, I'm in a particularly dark place at the moment. I've been here before, and understand it will pass, but right now, every stress I experience, no matter how large or insignificant, is met with the kneejerk reaction of ""Well, you could just end it."" and imagine myself either doing something active (isn't ever gonna happen), or being the passive participant in like, a car crash.  I know I'd be in much better shape even if everything in my life stayed the way it is right now (not particularly good) if I could just get Miss Doom and Gloom to shut the hell up. I am not in therapy, I am not nor have I ever been on meds, but I am closer every day to thinking I need to change that. But in the meantime... any advice?","1"

I haven't felt like this since I was 18 (5 years ago). It seems like this is an endless hole that I can't get myself out of. I can't afford a therapist, I can barely afford electricity and gas for my car. I'm in trouble. What do I do?","1"
"I don't even know what I'm living for these days. Actually, since 2014, I had good memories, though, I feel really burdened. Actually it was the best part of my life, hanging out for no reason, drinking for no reason but in the end, when I'm left alone I had nothing. So, I've been trying to make right decisions for a year. I painted, I drew things, appreciated by hoomans, gain lots of followers and what has left from it? NONE. A huge zero, I'm ashamed of my life. I got no friends properly, I feel burdened when people are kind to me. I... I... I...I'm trying to stay strong for a long time, I swear, I'm holding back the tears, I'm so sick of myself, wish I were still full of life. A part of me is dead, a part of me is still a child. It's gonna be like Alyssa in silent hill, hater and scary. It really is actually. I'm so sick of being underestimated and I think I don't take what I deserve in this life. EVERYONE has difficulties in life I know, but I have now zero (0) courage to live. The child part of me is still writing songs for unhappy, left alone people to encourage them. But who will be my supporter? Sorry for broken English anyway, I think I want to write more later. I need your help.","1"

"I posted here about 4 or 5 months ago and I just want to rant a little. Forgive me for spelling errors I am correcting them when I catch them. I know there are people that have it much worse than I do. With the Christmas Holidays coming around I am falling deeper into a hole. I posted about how I was struggling mentally. Just a little backstory. I am 27 Year old husband and step father of two. I've been married for 4 years and together for 6 years. I have taken the children in as my own and love and cherish them deeply. Over the past year my life has become a spiral of random things going wrong. I lost my job working for the ""Never Stop Improving"" company. (Their Motto). The company decided insurance was too much and decided to let all full time employees go except for the ones who where stuck up the bosses aes. When this happened I had a life threatening surgery happen. So every dollar I had I spent to keep myself alive. During this time my family on my mothers side (Mother is deceased) decided to try and help. Well they come up with the conclusion money is more important to them and basically cut me off and blackballed me from that side of the family. I was the only one in the family who had a job and didn't ever get in trouble. They are all married to felons and such. Great Group.My family on my father's side and wife's side are poor as we are if not more. So after my surgery Christmas 2016 was around the corner. I didn't have any money whats so ever. I was at the point of where I wanted to end it all. I could not buy any presents for my family who always looks up to me. I didn't talk about my problems to anyone and suffered on the inside for a long time. I had two friends that I've know on XBOX live for many years. They took money to buy our kids gifts and presents. My faith in humanity was restored for some time. These two people did not have to do what they did for me. I was in shock and awe.So after Christmas income tax came around and I paid everything I owed and everyone I owed back. We used very little for ourselves. In April I found a job. I am back in sales for a family run company. My bosses love me and treat me and my family as their own. Things improved, I moved up the ranks and made a decent living through out the summer months until about July is when I really started to struggle mentally again. I was shutting everyone out and wouldn't let them in. My wife finally decided enough was enough and could see it every day me falling apart. She made me go get professional help. I went and seen a DR. I was diagnosed with PTSD (Working for the Prisons, non military). Before I met my wife I went through some traumatic events working for the prisons. It was maximum security prisons in Texas. I was also diagnosed with severe depression and severe anxiety. So I start taking medicine. I take a long release Xanax and anti depressants that we have went though several brands due to side effects. Some I had problems with my bedroom life with the wife and some gave me tremors. Now with the Holidays coming back it hits me hard. I though we had all our finances worked out. I get paid and go to buy groceries for the first time in months. We do not receive benefits in any for due to not qualifying. Recently my kids had to move schools cause I couldn't make lunch payments. So when we are checking out someone had over drafted my account and taking all of my money and I was the most embarrassed person in my life. I was so proud of being able to get groceries and this hit me with the weight of a million bricks. I had a huge panic attack in the car( never had one before, thought I was dying). So I contact my bank and being this was during Thanksgiving they couldn't do anything until this week. Monday I go to the bank and try and work it out and no prevail. They are not willing to help. I am stuck way upside down and have no way to fix it. Rolling into the Christmas season is so hard for me knowing I will have the same problems like last year. I promised my son an Xbox one so we can play together. I have desperately applied for loans and help and cannot get anything. To make matters worse I got the results from a one of my Dr's on my blood work this morning and I have a serious infection somewhere inside my body. (non cancer, more of a cyst of some sort that is effecting my white blood cell count and making me sick)My wife knows something is wrong cause she can see it in my face at night when I stay up all night. When she goes to bed I stay up almost all night playing either on my Xbox or computer to just get away. I'm just at my wits end with the struggle and do not see a light at the end of the tunnel. I find it to be the hardest thing in my life. I have fought for my life more than once and it seemed so much easier than this. Financials and money can drive a person insane. My wife is the greatest person I know but I cannot open up to her for the fact I feel like I am not a man. I do have too much pride at times and I got so many supportive messages from everyone but the effects wear off fairly quickly and medicine is just a joke in my personal opinion cause all it does is numb you down. I feel like a zombie at times after I take it. My wife seen me smile the other day at a barbeque for the first time in months. I do not smile. I do not feel happy. I feel helpless and lost.","1"
"I learned this morning that another person I know from home was lost to suicide. I had to stop and reflect on this for a moment, this is the second person in under a year from my hometown that has decided that they have had enough of life. That to carry on causes more pain than to end it all then and there. The loved ones left behind, wondering could I have done something to stop this? How did I not see the signs? The truth is you are not to blame. You are not to know what is going on inside someone else's mind. Depression knows no barriers, it doesn't matter how much money you have, where you were born and the family you were born into, where you went to school, the colour of your skin or your status in the world. There doesn't have to be a traumatic situation to feel its wrath. It takes hold of everyday people, maybe your colleague who you work next to every day. Maybe the cashier at the local supermarket who asks you how your day is and when you reply, and you? They say great thanks. Maybe that invisible dark cloud is hovering and you have no idea.When we are physically sick you can look in the mirror and see it, other people can see it. What do we do when we are sick? We want to get better as soon as we can, so we go to the Doctor get medication and rest up. Friends and family wish us a speedy recovery. We do not have any qualms about telling the people around us, strangers even, that we are unwell. So why is it, with depression we keep our feelings hidden, why is it depression is not also treated as a sickness? Just because no one can see it, why does it mean it doesn't exist? Why do depression sufferers feel shame? I ask these questions as a person that too, has suffered from this illness.  I write this to connect with other people that may want to understand what they are feeling, that are maybe running out of hope and may be thinking of giving up. To create awareness in general which needs to be promoted more in New Zealand culture with its stigma of being a tough, she'll be right mate attitude. To explore new ideas on different ways to fight this thing, because one thing I can say is that you can fight this thing, you are only yet to open Pandora's box on the remedy that works for you. Four years ago I felt that invisible dark cloud creep into my life, two of those years trying to ignore it and hope it would go away and the other two experimenting to find out what works for me. I write this as my own perspective on my own journey, which others may resonate with. The thing is, the battle is such an individual experience; there is no one size fits all. You can't tick all the boxes and say yes, I have depression.  You do not wake up one day and think I am now depressed. Five months ago I finally had the courage to start telling the people closest to me, what had been going on inside my head for the past four years, a catalyst for a multitude of things I did not deal with when I was younger. I would call myself an introvert, I hold my emotions inside, overtime this turned into a compression chamber  something had to give.  Not only was my brain wanting to explode but I also had physical stress-related symptoms  trouble sleeping, headaches, crying a lot, pain in my jaw so bad I couldnt eat, and bladder problems.  But the worst of it wasn't the physical symptoms it was the mental pain, the hopelessness, the anxiety, the feeling of am I ever going to feel happy again? The feelings of being alone and unloved; when in fact this is the part that is most untrue which we tell ourselves is true. We think that no one cares about us; we trick ourselves into thinking that if we died tomorrow what difference would it make? There are another 3 billion people in the world. We believe that we do not have a purpose. We do not love ourselves. That, in a weird way, feels physical. It makes your whole body feel heavy. I am a big believer in natural remedies, I believe in giving our bodies the nutrients it needs to be strong for us and to be healthy. Because of this, I was determined not to seek prescribed medication. The first step in my recovery journey was 2 years ago when I started practicing yoga. Yoga helped me look inwards and seek inner peace, where at that time; there was so much inner turmoil. In those 60 minutes three times a week, I was present; I would focus on me and my practice and forget everything else beyond my mat. The meditations helped me to control my thoughts a bit better. When thoughts arose, being able to let them pass without any judgement, not letting my thoughts control me. I carried those principles into everyday life. If I would start getting overwhelmed I would turn inwards and focus on my breath. This also helped me with my sleeping as I would use the same breathing techniques when falling asleep. I still feel like I needed more, I hit a low point in June this year. I got so overwhelmed with my situation, at that time I contemplated ending it all. I scared myself a lot and I remember telling one of my friends while on holiday, ""I am scared I am going to do something stupid but I don't want to"" she was quite obviously confused, we were out partying and I didn't want to burden her night so I said ""I will tell you another day"" when we did end up talking about it, I opened up to her and it was the first time I had really told anyone. She was very supportive and just getting it out actually took a bit of the weight off my shoulders.  I decided I was going to bite the bullet and try antidepressants because I was so sick of my thoughts and wanted them to go away. I didnt like the idea of numbing my personality (not feeling bad but not feeling really good either) but I was willing to try anything at this stage because I couldn't take it anymore. I took the day off work and headed down to the Doctors. I explained what was going on and he prescribed me Cipralex which gives your brain a surge of melatonin. I was told I wouldn't feel the effects of the drugs until about five days in. I think it was about day four and I am sitting at my desk and my heart starts beating incredibly fast, and I have the shakes and my legs won't  stop moving  and it feels like a surge of adrenalin that has nowhere to go. It was awful! I stopped taking the drugs straight away as the side effects were defiantly not worth it. Still determined to fight it I started researching online.  I found a couple of videos online about the effects of Omega 3 on the brain, on people who are depressed especially the ingredient EPA in a high dose. Off I went to the pharmacy for Omega 3 pills. I have now been taking the Omega 3 tablets for about three months and started to notice my mood change, I didn't feel as dark anymore. The last thing for me was one of the most fundamental decisions I ever made. I started a gratitude journal which I write in every morning when I wake up and again before I go to sleep. I have been doing this for just over 2 months and this is a 3-month experiment. I have never been much of a writer as I feel I cannot really portray my feelings in the way I want to, so I was surprised when this started working. In the beginning of the day I write down what I am excited for that day, the exercise I will be doing that day, and the meals I will be eating. At the end of the day, I write down good things that happened that day, what I am grateful for and what I hope for tomorrow. You wouldn't believe how hard this can be some days. When most days are the same... right? Get up early, go to work, come home have dinner, repeat. But I think why it really worked is because you HAVE to think of something, at least two things, for that day so you become more aware of the small things around you. Today the sun was so nice on my skin while I was on my lunch break  I am grateful for that. I am grateful when one of my colleagues came up to me and said ""you are so smart you can do whatever you put your mind to"", I was out on a horse today; my passion  I am so grateful for this. When your attitude turns into an attitude of gratitude, things really start to change. Your perspective changes, you start to notice how lucky you are, how many supportive people surround you, that you are not alone, that there is so much out there to experience in the world. Naturally more good things gravitate towards you  more opportunities, more things to write down and be grateful for. I end each week with a summary. The things I am proud of, things that I was happy about, I also write down the bad things that happened and what I learned from this and things I can improve on. By doing so, the negative experiences in my life aren't overwhelming. Bad days happen to everyone, but it is actually your reaction to them, I write down how I felt about those days and release everything on paper, the release I think is what helps us get stronger, we are no longer weighing ourselves down with guilt, resentment, and sadness. I try and look at those days as a learning process. This exercise feels like it was the last bit of the jigsaw puzzle for me. I now look at life as a gift rather than a burden; I am excited about what is going to happen tomorrow, the next day and the next. I no longer worry about the future or get overwhelmed in difficult situations or feel that invisible dark cloud lurking over me. I urge you to be brave. Keep trying and never give up, find what your remedy is, maybe it is medication, maybe it is finding your passion, exercise or writing down your feelings, maybe it's therapy maybe it is something completely different. It is a winding road with lots of hazards on the way, but I promise you, if you can do this, you can do anything. ","1"

"Hi my wife has serious depression wheres the point that she want to kill herself day and night. She tells me that she is sad, miserable and nothing seem fun to her all the time. In the earlier relationship with her, she was able to handle it. But after she was force by police to take her to the hospital and let the doctors lock her in a white room for 12 hours. After that day things got worse. That happen two years ago and she is still traumatized by it. Because of that reason, she doesnt trust cops and therapy anymore. For her to feel better she tried different method since she studies psychology and depression in college. She tried to find new interests in her life and nothing last long because she lost energy over anything. Then we try different drugs,  so far weed is the only thing that kinda help her sleep but thats all. I mean even it helps her sleep, it doesnt seem that she is forever happy and there is so much we can do until weed doesnt work anymore. Some nights when she is depress she can cry for many hours and as her husband of course I will try my best to support and be next to her. To be honest Im not professionals and its not easy task at all. Although I know she loves me and I love her but love is not enough help her to be all better. I dont want to see her suffer like this. Its painful to see someone you love that much to hurt themselves like that, at the same time there is not much we can do to help the lover to be completely better or not feeling depress anymore. Im writing this in desperate help so please help her out and we will take whatever advices that could help.","1"

"I am broken. I am so tired of this. 2016 was the most amazing year of my life because of this girl I met. I broke up with her in summers because it was getting too violent and poisonous for both of us. She didn't see what she became and kept telling me how I victimize myself and it went wrong in a billion other ways. I used to self hurt and everything just so she would understand me. We broke up. As soon as I broke up she went and fucked a guy. She fucked him so many times lol. So many. Then she asked me to come back to her. She didn't tell me that they fucked she just told me that they made out and that. That made me suicidal even if I wanted I couldn't. I loved her. I am an emotional type but I understand things but she was something for me. I stole for her I fought for her I begged for her I almost failed for her. I did everything for her. I know how amazing I was to her and I know how amazing she was to me. Oh and I was an introvert. An introvert falling in love. Falling in love so bad that he went to parties he tried to dance he clicked photos of his face. For her. So that he could see her happy. I fell so bad for her. We broke up. And then the downhill began of my life. I never used to smoke cigarette. I used to hate them I stopped everyone from smoking them and now I practically live on them. I get high everyday I smoke weed like its oxygen for me. I don't have friends. Lol my friends meet her more my friends hang out with her more my childhood friends. They don't even know how I am. I was there for them. They used to talk to me I used to help them. You name them? Breakup? I helped. Money? I helped. Studies? I helped (even though I never could study) friendship? I helped. Childhood trauma? I helped. Father sexually abusing her daughter? I helped. I was there for them 24/7 and in return I never asked for a thing a single favor I never asked for anything because I want to be a psychologist right I understand people I understand problems I never took advantage of my friends. I asked for nothing. For nothing from them. And they treated me a good friend too. I under went another bad breakup before this but I couped with it. I understood what she wanted and I knew I was right and I forgave her and I didn't let any of my friend know about her. She never existed for 99.9 people in my life. Lol now 100 that .01% also went. That secret. I never asked for anything. Then she came and naturally I changed. I did everything for her and everybody knew about her. So I changed. I got dependent on her. A guy who already went to self harm to another level. Passing on the bathroom floor but not letting anyone worry or know got dependent of ya I didn't take the previous breakup that perfectly lmao but It wasn't this long. I got dependent and then she left. So did my friends. I have no one to talk to. I trust no one to help me with my problems and no one even tries except one or two people and I know what they will say. So I don't ask them anyways. Except them none of my friends helped. No one tried. I just wanted someone to see the sadness behind my high and blurred lifestyle. I just wanted someone to see how sad I am right now and how much I want someone to be there. This is my second post on anywhere? I deleted the first one in two minutes. I don't know what I am expecting. But I just want someone who'd understand me. Who'd know that I've pain behind all this happy face guy who helps everyone. I literally help everyone and I know I do no one can deny it I am the nicest guy people meet and they know it and I know it probably some of them think I am naive that I help everyone I don't I just.. I just.. Want someone to be my friend. You know? What they show you in movies and tv shows this friend who they can cry with and share everything with. I had one friend but I lost her too. I never needed something like that but now I do and no one sees that. All they see is that he changed. They don't even call me anymore or hangout with me unless they want to get high. And I happily do it. I deleted everything. I really wish I had someone to talk to. She told me. I treated her like shit. She told me I was like everyone she ever dated. An asshole. It hurts. I can't stop crying. I have been on that chair with the noose hanging, I've been on the ledge of that building, I've had a hand which was completely red with blood so many times only to back out at the last moment. Someday I wont. This is eating me up. I didn't treat her like shit. That's not fair. Everyone knows how great I was to her and she was to me no doubt but when she said all I ever did was treat her like shit I am losing it. I didn't treat her like shit. I don't even treat people like shit even if I don't like then or hate them I was ready to kill for her. I fought for her literally with people. She was my princess. She was everything I needed and she said I treated her like shit. I stole from my already broke as fuck family? We were so rich once but my father started gambling and we lost everything and still. I still stole for her so that we could go out so that she could enjoy with me. I didn't treat her like shit and I know she never asked me to do that but I did for her I did everything. I am on the ledge. I can't stop crying. I don't even want to post this anymore. So basically my life is hell. My family is broke. I have no friends no one to talk to. I got dependent guy who was an introvert is dependent but now have no one and needs a friend or someone. I hurt myself. I try to kill myself. Oh and did I mention this is the most crucial time for my future? Whatever I do today will decide my future? But lol I can't study. How can I? Everyone has hopes from me. My family i mean. I am so lost. Help me if you can. ","1"
"My wife is having a daughter next year. She doesn't want a daughter. I really don't want a daughter. It's our first kid.I don't want anything that goes with girls. Pink, ""cute"" sassy attitudes, dolls, nails, makeup, whorish Hollywood role models ...I don't have anyone to turn to. Women, who inherently want a girl, chastise me and tell me to just be grateful because they heard of someone who is barren. Men just shrug and say, 'you'll learn to accept it'.The only glimmer of hope is to double down and have a son later in life. I don't like those odd though. Never been diagnosed, but I definitely have SAD (who doesn't - it's human nature when you're in the rat race) and swings of depression, but I've always felt there would be better days. This thing is just going to leech off of me for 20 years then yell she hates me and wishes I were dead. ","1"
"My father is depressed and alcoholic. My family is guesstimating it started a few months ago. He went through rehab once and was 23 years sober - as old as me. (Me being the first born, helped him to the path of sobriety.) He has a hernia that hes been drinking the pain away and were 90% sure thats what caused him to originally start drinking again. We took him to the hospital when we originally found out about all of it, because we managed to get him to temporarily stop drinking, but the doctors couldnt operate on him because he was so weak from drinking. They did a temporary hernia procedure, but he needs surgery. He refuses it because hes scared hell never wake up. He also claims that hes seen his end. He just wants to be left alone and die in our basement. Is there anything we can do to help guide him back to sobriety and get this surgery? The toll is getting to be too much for my family since he doesnt want help. ","1"
"I feel like life is suffocating me and it's harder to as t to push back. It seems life can't ease up. I take three steps forward and life kicks me in the gut and proceeds to wail on me. It just doesn't stop. Back in March I had to take care of my aunt after open heart surgery. People helped, but it was mainly on me. Summer was mediocre and I had constant suicidal thoughts for seemingly no reason. I was set to FINALLY get in school in August, but had to take care of my stroke victim uncle and my aunt who had major back surgery. She said I could do both, but I knew I couldn't and missed the fall semester. I was pissed, but her kids are unhelpful fucks. The day after she came home one of her sins asked for 2 grand and the other insisted he knew what went in during PT sessions even though it was almost always me alone. It made me severely depressed and I had suicidal thoughts. I told my mom and she called me immature and told me to just shut the fuck up. Now I applied for the spring semester and rely on her for transportation. I need to attend a workshop for new students, but she's made every effort to make me miss it. Her only response is to ""take the pills"". She's the hugest fucking pill pusher. I can't tell her anything without it being about her or somehow her boyfriend. My friends are moving so far along and I feel left behind. I always joke about moving overseas to escape them. I feel lost and if I miss this semester I'm afraid it will push me over the edge. I can honestly say I could move across the world or even the states and be content with never speaking to them (my family) again. ","1"
"I cant live with the pain of losing him. I loved him. No matter the shit he put me through. He left because I couldnt trust. I couldnt trust because he kept losing it in the three years we were together. Ive loved him for 13 and hes my bestfriend weve known each other since we were babies. Hes everything Ive ever known and I know its a dumb selfish reason to kill myself but I dont want to live a life he isnt apart of. I love him. This love is different. I know there are some people out there in this world that know this kind of love. It wasnt like a normal kind of love. Be mean if you must I dont care anymore. Whats one less life in this terrible world?Ive been raped three times in my life two of those times was for a span on years. One by my step dad and one was my ex husband.And Ive been verbally abused my whole life by different people.Im also disabled and have had over 400 fractures in my life.

"Hello everyone,I would like some advise that you might give me, I had contacted my doctor last year about seeing someone to help with my anxiety and medication and she told me to come back for a mental health assessment as the appointment i needed would be longer. I didn't go back until a year later when i felt i was slipping again. She made me a referral to a place and i went and saw the person they assigned me to. I went to two appointments with her, but i felt as though she was dismissive and wasn't really understanding of my issues or able to help me. So 3 months later after our last appointment i rang the place and asked them to change psychologists. Now I have the appointment coming up this weekend and I had been thinking would it be weird or okay to write a letter with all my thoughts and feelings so that i could give it to her because it might be easier to go through it that way so i don't forget all i want to say in the limited one hour session?

"Im not really sure where to start. I've been diagnosed with chronic depression, anxiety, and bipolar disorder and have been living with it for about five years. This is caused me to drop out of college and gets stuck in a minimum wage job that does not give me enough hours to live off of. Because of that I feel more like a burden to both my girlfriend and my closest friend because we decided to rent an apartment together and where we split everything evenly. In the last two years alone I have gone through roughly 6 jobs without being able to hold down one of them and my most current job I am a delivery driver and I gained 7 Bucks an hour and only making about$400 a month. Between the rent that I have to pay her electricity the internet my credit card bills and whatever else I have to pay for I lose about 2 to $300 a month because I have not able to afford it.

I went there 2 years of college and attempted suicide twice. I don't want to think like this again but I don't know if I can stop it. I'm in a loop a catch-22.

"I am a 22 year old male student in England. I think I have been depressed for about 3 months but I'm really not sure, I wasn't popular at school but I had a good social life and good friends, when I got to uni at first I loved it, but after a while I started to realise maybe my friends weren't completely my type of people. I also was not having much of a love life, I have never been hugely prolific but mist people improve their love life at university. I was comparing my experience with my friends who went to other universities and it was getting me down.By the time second year came around I started self medicating with weed, I was smoking every day, I would wake up feeling empty and alone, despite the fact I had a girlfriend that year, but by about 4 o'clock that day I would be completely numbed by weed. I failed this year as a result and so I took it again, however this time round I felt exactly the same but without girlfriend to turn to when I was lonely. I did exactly the same thing and just about scraped a pass. I became convinced that I the root of all my problems was the weed, and that that was the reason I was lazy and didnt give a shit about anything, So for my this year I decided to quit. I thought that quitting would make everything better, and for a while it did, I started going to the gym, connecting better with my friends better and even slept with a couple of girls. But one of the girls that I liked has started blanking me, I've started really flunking uni again and the feeling has come back so much worse. This time round I don't have weed to turn to and I have been awake at night with anxiety. I have stopped caring about uni all I care about is trying to be happy but as a result I am feeling uni and this is making me so anxious, and hopeless.I don't know where to turn, I'm worried my friends will see me differently and I want nothing less than their pity, and I know it would ruin my parents.This is the first time I have really admitted this to anyone, anonymously or not, I don't know what to do and I don't even know if I want answers, I just want to get it out.

"I need help. I'm blessed/cursed with lupus and lately have been feeling like my job/career is a dead end. Recently the person I love the most and thought they would be there for me through whatever has told me he doesn't know if he wants to be with me anymore, out of nowhere. I haven't been dealing this very well. One day it's fine I'll ignore him but then I see him and it makes me sad that we're not laughing or embracing each other. So then I go on my rants trying to make him understand how I feel and it just makes things worse because he just wants to be alone. Okay. But then I see in his phone he's talking to all these girls throughout the day and he can't send me a simple text to see how I'm doing. I really lost it the other night and said something about dying and he was such a dick about it that I grabbed a razor and and held it to my throats over him asking if he thought this was funny. I don't remember much after that other than trying it over and over again and just asking him if he would just let me die. I then explained to him some dark tragic childhood shit and let him know that he's presences has constantly been with me keeping me a float. I know I'm a fucking pill but my heart is so broken that I literally don't know what to do. I don't want to hurt him and I don't want to be hurt. I just want things to go back to how they were. Any advice, I'm literally in a city where I have no friends. ","1"
"I feel like ive always had some type of anxiety or depression pretty much my whole life. Growing up i was really shy and not social at all. All through high school it was like this. Didnt really make friends. I had a couple friends i knew for a while, so when i did make new friends it was through them. Almost never talk to anyone, and hardly made eye contact. That changed when i got my first job. I became way more confident in myself and started to be more outgoing. Started going to the gym( i was overweight for most my younger years). hung out with random ppl. I felt like i had a lot going for myself even tho i didnt have the best job, or even tho i wasnt great in school and dropped out of college multiple times. I still felt so much potential within myself. I felt like i could do anything. At this time i became a pothead basically.Fast forward years later. I began to feel those feelings creep up again , anxiety, questioning what im doing with myself and my life. Motivation was on the way down. I thought it was just a phase and that i would get passed it. Fast forward again i ended up getting a job working overnight. I liked it at first cuz ive always been a night owl and i also made decent money. But working overnight pretty much pushed me back into this depression and anxiety, pushed me further than i ever felt. I worked 12hr shifts 3-4 times a week.the problem was this. I lived with 5 other ppl (my family) and 3 dogs. The average sleep i got was about 3-4hrs with several interruptions in between. I never slept for more than an hour at a time. And id be awake another hour just laying in bed overthinking about shit that doesnt matter. Having conversations with myself. Feeling sad as hell for seemingly no reason at all. Knowing that im laying there as the world passes by was so discouraging and made me feel so bad. Going thru this cycle for a couple years. I just didnt want to do anything anymore but smoke weed and play games on my phone. So i quit my job thinking it will get better. And now here i am, several months after quitting my job and i feel worse it seems like. I get anxious so easily. I feel like an asshole because i ghosted on my few good friends i had. Just stopped answering calls and texts. Idk what it is its like im scared or something. Im stuck in this cycle. Wake up at 9am smoke a few bowls alone, lock myself in my room, sleep til its dark. Wake up around 8pm chill smoke again stay up til 4/5am then do it all again. I feel so confused, unmotivated, anxious, depressed, and lonely as hell. I feel its my own fault i put myself in this position. I read other ppls posts or read inspiring things and it does nothing. Ive had 6 job interviews set up and i end up getting bad anxiety and dont show up. Hygiene is horrid. Showering and brushing my teeth seems like such a hassle im disgusted with myself. Only times i go out is to stock up on snacks, get fast food, or get more weed. And even doing those stresses me out and gives me such anxiety. I just want to get away from everything and everyone, be alone in a peaceful quiet place where i wont be bothered. I just dont know what to do anymore. I dont even know why im posting this cuz i feel like its useless and wont help. Man i just want this to go away. Sorry for the long post but i dont know how else to describe this feeling and yet i still feel like im missing important parts to this whole thing.  My head is in scribbles and i need help.","1"
"For some reason I just cant understand this feeling.  I dont want to kill myself. I just dont want to exist. I want to know purpose. Why do I try so hard for a life I dont want to live. What is there to drive myself to obtain what I think should be better. I see the progression of my life, and I understand that by no means is it a hard life. Just a meaningless one and I see no use for it. My mind is not at peace and I dont understand how to make it balanced. To be okay with what this is. To be okay with the understanding of nothing.

"Suicide is such a beautiful concept to me but with my depression I self harm but have never attempted suicide because I feel if I can Bleed from a simple cut I am this still alive and human and here though usually dissasociation wants to prove otherwise and with that I have to respect my gifted life. However I will pray and pray and beg and plead for God to take my soul away so I may go to heaven with my mom and her family and find love and eternal peace and happiness and if in reality I end up just ceasing to exist entirely then who cares because I won't and I'm fine with that too. Or maybe simply embracing any transition in death good bad or none is still worthy enough to me compared to the sad torturous mental instable no home or family and an abusive relationship working endlessly at a fast food job even with college degrees with no hope in sight destroying my being increasingly each day to the point if God doesn't take me then suicide may just be the option and thinking inthat way is scary but honestMy anxiety is a 9 out of ten and depression an 9 out of tenWhat has helped others in my posisition?I know seasonal depression worrsens it and probably losing my home and new car in the process helps not at all.And living with a constant relapsing drug addict is not good either but i have to stay with him as he emotionally abuses me and mentally drains me and uses me just for the slight Chance his wealthy parents might toss us a bone so that I'm not entirely screwed.Situaltional stuff doesn't help when your already mentally f-ed.Idk what to doI need an escape of peace and freedom and relaxation and loveThat i cant haveAdvice?","1"
"Okay, for some background, my 15 year-old little sister is self-harming (via cutting herself), and extremely depressed.  This was new information to me about a month and a half ago.  Since then I've done my best to remove anything sharp and all high-dose medications from her, and kept a close eye on her.  When I first confronted her about it, there was a lot of crying and me trying to comfort her, and she promised to work on stopping, and I arranged it so that my brother and I would work together to supply her with our antidepressants/anti-anxiety meds, as we both have had our fair share of mental/emotional issues, and have actually been treated.  You're probably wondering why I didn't tell an adult and get her treated as well, but there is in fact a reason: since she was seven years old, she's wanted to be in the Air Force.  Shes trained and done everything she possibly could to make sure her dream could happen, and I've never met a harder worker in my life.  This is all well and fine, except the Air Force has rules against accepting anyone who's been treated for depression with medication, or seen a therapist for more than six months at any point.  This dream has been one of the only things keeping her alive.  I know that if I tell my parents (or any other adult in my life) about how bad it's gotten, they'll obviously send her to get help, but that would be worse than a death sentence for her.  I'm terrified she'll kill herself if that happens, or at the very least, it'll destroy our relationship forever.  But I can't let this go on. She's not getting better, and I don't think she's even taking the medication.  Yesterday I found out she tried to hang herself in her room with one of my belts.  Thank God it snapped.  But I live in fear of the day she tries something fool-proof.  I'm afraid to do anything because right now, shes kind of a cornered animal, and if she panics... you see where I'm going with this.  I can't even sleep at night I'm so worried.  Should I tell my parents, and risk not only my relationship, but her life? Or should I try something else to get her to stop on her own?  Please, please, someone help","1"

"Hey,I'm brand new to reddit and have no idea what I'm doing so please know that from the start. Also, I'll try to make this as short as possible. Here goes... I've had depression since I was at least 12 (29 now) possibly longer although I can't remember really. 12 is when I actually remember dealing with severe depression and suicidal ideation for the first time. My mental health has been a really bad roller coaster ever since, and I hate roller coasters! I'm convinced that my brain has developed to have a lower set point of happiness than the average person, and my default settings for coping, even when not in a major depressive episode, is to have negative, intrusive, really bad thoughts, and suicidal ideation. Over the years I've been on and off medications some helped, some didn't. I started seeing a psychiatrist a while back, 1 1/2 - 2 years ago maybe, because I was in a really bad place and very close to ending my life. The closest I've ever gotten. I feel like I have been doing fairly well on my med regimen until a few months ago when a few things went sideways in my life, a major increase in work stress being one of them. The stress triggered me to start having suicidal ideation again, and that concerned me because I began having them ON my meds that had been working. I should break down my med regimen probably... Lexapro 40mg, Wellbutrin 300mg, Concerta 36mg, Ritalin 10mg PRN, and Neurontin 600mg total a day. These meds are treating my depression (mdd and dysthymia), pmdd, anxiety, recently diagnosed adhd-pi, nerve pain from interstitial cystitis (the neurontin). I'm sure there's more that I'm forgetting.. I've been hesitant to change a med for the past couple times that I've went to my doc but I'm not getting better even with less stress, if anything I'm slowly getting worse. I'm always hesitant to do something different with my meds because I'm afraid if it doesn't help, it will make me feel more helpless/hopeless. At my visit Saturday with my doc, we decided to taper off Lexapro, and start a taper of Zoloft 100mg. Here's to hoping...I guess what I'm trying to ask is: what if I won't be able to find a medication regimen that will make me feel better? Is Zoloft going to be better than Lexapro? (I know there really isn't an answer for that....) What if my brain can't achieve a level of happiness that others' can? Is the answer finding the right medications or is this a deeper existential issue? My philosophy on life is, why even? How can I continue to fight and try to get and stay better when my long term thoughts about life are that it is all pointless anyway? Why try, why bother, why continue to suffer for my entire life because my brain doesn't do happy? The point to life is finding happiness and fulfillment, and if that isn't going to happen for me what the heck am I even doing here?!?Sooo.... thanks for reading if you do. I suppose I'm trying to feel less lost in life if anyone has pointers.","1"

"I know I need help. I am very depressed. My whole family is depressed. We grew up in it. I have been able to live with it and work through it but lately I feel like I cant. I think about suicide all the time, but Im not at the point where I could do it. But the thoughts are always there and thats what bothers me. I feel like I cant handle much of anything anymore, I cry all the time. I never knew what people meant when they would say on line that they felt like things would be better for everyone if they were gone, but now I do. I got into a really bad car wreck recently, I wasnt driving, and the officers told us if they car had been an older model or just different car we would have died. I told my mom and all she said was you just wont die will you. I think this incident started my major downward spiral. There is this guy that I go out with, he is very sweet and I am blessed to have him in my life. I cause a lot of problems for him, and this is not just on my head, its a fact. But he is not a good listener. He think he knows all the answers. So when I try to talk to him he interrupts me and tells me a life story and says to be happy with what I have. It just makes me more depressed and honestly I have started to tune him out when he does this. It makes me sad that he doesnt care what I have to say, or that he wont let me finish a thought.Typing this out makes me feel both better and worse. Any response is appreciated, thank you","1"
"Hey guys I'm an 18 year old male. My family has an extensive history of depression anxiety and some psychosis. I've lived through a lot of stuff contributing to my depression and lately I thought I'd gotten over it. My problem is my lack of motivation makes me not wanna do anything expected of me. I slack a lot and it's always getting in the way of others particularly my older brother. I've honestly given up on myself because I can never improve despite nearly infinite chances. It's become a habit that I don't know how to fix and though I can feel my depression slowly creeping back up onto me, all that I can think of is a way to get out of the people whose live I'm in at the moment so that they don't have to waste their time and energy on someone that hasn't been worth it for years. At the moment the only tomorrow I have to look forward to is waiting till he graduates so that I don't ruin his schooling further (my depression last year forced him to basically retake an entire semester). I've been planning out my suicide for a few weeks but today after the full brunt of my actions only getting in his way was realized, I made a legitimate plan complete with a date and my actions leading up to it. I want to be useful but I don't know how and trying to meet every criteria I'm meant to meet just makes me fall short in every aspect. It is entirely my fault because I am lethargic and unmotivated. I need a way out and I've not found one on my own Any help negative or positive is welcome. Thank you","1"
"I am an 18 year old male who came here because whenever i feel destroyed, i feel better by writing my feelings and seeing people that care, responding. Well let me tell you a little bit about me... about a year and a half ago I split up with my girlfriend in which we were 9 months together... probability is she cheated on me. I had no friends back than but i had one and only friend. Me and my friend decided that we should find a group of friends and start to hang with them... we found one but they were all super depressed ... they were depressed to an extent that whenever we hangout they will all start crying and stuff like that. That led for all the people in the group to leave. All that were left were me and my friend and all the depressed people haha. I couldnt take it no more since they were making me more depressed so i left them and it was back just to hanging out with the original friend. This friend found a girlfriend and i barely have ever heard of him since... At this point i was alone with nobody to turn to. I found a group of friends that were like the popular people but they were obsessed with partying were they would all grt drunk... in fact i have got drunk a lot of times... which i am not proud of at all. The only one in this group that i was reallt close to tried to commit suicide where he was interned into a mental hospital. This didn't help me at all. At this point i was super depressed where i had to go to therapy and stuff like that. In fact I have depression. This even effected my grades where nearly every teacher told me to give up because i was doing terrible haha... i still got my alevels and their negative comments didnt effect me (that i am proud of). In the summer i staryed to o to gym which helped me alot mentally and physically... even i have the pride of people seeing me like a fitness guru... some even think i am on steroids(sorry if I sounded cocky haha didnt mean to)... in the summer i had a huge fight with the group of friends because i cancelled on a weekend in a flat together a week before we went (i know it wasn't the best decision from my part but they exagerated it a lot) ... this led for half the group hating me to this day but i never cared since i had 3 great friends from that group in which i cared only about them. BUT this last month they have treated me like crap... example i would text them ""where are you guys?"" To meet with them during free period in college and they would see it and not text me back until they enter a lecture.. so i spend a lot of free period alone hhaha... yesterday they told me they were not going to enter a certain lecture into thinking i wouldnt enter either ... but i entered and guess what? I find them all there together which crushed me tbh... and today they met for black friday to go shopping together and nobody told me to go with.... i am feeling destroyed tbh life just keep throwing stuff at me and i am literally giving up ... this is becoming too much... i managed to diminish my depression a lot without any medication in which i am rly proud of but life seem to not give me a break...thanks for taking time to read my comment ... i really appreciate it :)","1"
"Every holiday something traumatic has happened to me. I'm still living with that same family now, and know my only way out is school. It's hard for me to focus because of the people around me; those who are abusive members of my family, and those who are friends and celebrating with their families. I feel stranded. I feel thrown away by God. I know I'm young and theres still time for me to have my own family but everything seems so far away, and it's like I'm in a race, and while everyone is on land, I'm the only one neck deep in water.","1"
"Hey guys. I think i have been depressed for almost two years. I'm 30M and never before i had anything like this. I used to be a really happy and active person. I had to get out of my country due to the political and economical situation (Venezuela), i am living in Costa Rica right now, a very beautiful country, full of great people. And it sucks man! im single, alone, dont have any real friends here, cant get myself a girlfriend, my work really sucks its a very stressful place. And after two really big love dissapointments i found myself in a really dark place.Yesterday was my first psychological appointment. And i havent felt more excited in a really long time. Its like for the first time, theres something positive or an hope for me, like a plan or a goal. It was just the suracce but i think it might help.My fear is. What if it doesnt work? Is it always gonna be like that?Im new in this. Thank you.","1"
"Hi everyone! Ive been suffering from depression, anxiety, and ocd (all undiagnosed but I know its there) for quite some time now. Ocd started in 4th grade, depression and anxiety in 7th. Im in my second year at college now and due to recent events in my life its only getting worse. Ive been acting out in ways that Im not proud of in result (anger, running away from my problems, hurting others [not physically], so on and so forth), and Ive never been that way before, but now every little thing makes me so mad and Ill be mean, then Ill calm down and have a breakdown because I know this isnt who I am. Ive asked for help from my parents but having other siblings its not their biggest concern at the moment.  I am 18 so I can get help myself although my insurance is not that good for mental health doctors. It feels like I am continuously falling into a pit of self-loathe and an aching sadness more and more each day. At this point I dont even know what to do anymore. Im not sure if I should start with a therapist or see a psychiatrist, my parents wouldnt see antidepressants as a cure, although Ive never tried them and legally I am of age to make my own decisions. Its been so long and Im not sure where to start on the road to recovery. Any advice or anecdotes to share? ","1"
"Hi all, I've been with my bf for over 3 years, and he has been depressed for longer than that.I try to support him the best I can, often letting him purchase marijuana which relaxes him, and buying fuel- he likes to drive around too to cheer himself up. The problem is we can't afford this anymore, and I'm nervous that without these things he's going to go downhill. What ideas do you have as an alternative? or any other tips to help him? I'm nervous that I'm going to prioritize his happiness currently- only to put us in wayyy more financial stress and heartbreak later...Any tips or comment would be appreciated- or please let me know if this is inappropriate to post here.

"Well, ive talked with several docs and therapists now went to a ""Klinik fr geistige gesundheit"" i dont know how it is in other countries but in germany it Stands for ""clinic for mental health"". Its basically a place where you ""should"" learn how to do daily Things again. To be honest i really liked the time there, the first time in my Life i felt like people are really listening to me and trying to help me. Unfortunately i had to leave there because my mom had her drinking   Problem again and i had to be with her and try to help her. Found out my mom thinks its her fault that i have depression... the fact that i couldnt even tell her how wrong she is and that it is Not her fault at all hurted me so much because i dont know.... my entire life just Sounds like a cliche. My mother used to drink much when i was young she crashed her car drunk and was brought home by Police while Being drunk. I was bullied nearly my entire shooltime, my sister used to manipulate me, i had a landlord who reasoned me for everything bad that happened. And that all are just some of the reasons that keep me awake at night. I just dont know anymore how i can Go on. Im rarely leaving the House because im afraid of people. I need a therapist but im not able to even call one. Everytime i want to talk to someone about it i am just scrapping that plan and pretend everything is fine. it feels like its better to didnt feel anything at all, than to go through all of this on a daily basis.","1"

These last few months have been some of the shittiest months of my life and I dont know how to make it better. It just seems like I let everyone down and do everything wrong. I cant remember the last time Ive been genuinely happy. Id never attempt to take my own life, but Ive been wondering lately how everyones lives would be better if I was never born or if I just disappeared or never existed. I havent been eating right, I dont have any motivation to get out of bed anymore, i sleep all day, I dont have any desire to get dressed up or even shower nowadays. I havent gone to class in two weeks, I quit my job, lost all my friends. I just really dont want to be here anymore and Im so fucking tired of being sad all the time.","1"

"Hi guys/girls. I've had depression for nearly a decade and it's only getting worse and worse, I've been prescribed anti depressants before but I didn't want to take them because I felt like I wanted to controls my own emotions and stuff, which looking back is pretty stupid and uncontrollable. I'm already overweight and I've heard they make you want to eat even more, is that true? Do they actually work? In terms of what they're prescribed for. Do they actually make you happier? I'm at the stage where nothing can make me happy. I feel like it's the end of my life.","1"
"I feel so depressed and lost the care I use to have in school. I have zero friends in most of my classes except only 2 which is just Band and Lunch even though that's not a class. I only have four really good friends and they only in those two periods. The rest of the day is just me being silent. I don't know how to really connect with people because all I do is complain and use that as a conversation. I have no job and wish to make money but I'm so busy with music. I want to make a living out of it but it's just not going to happen it's a ""dead job"". So I'm thinking of doing something with computers to make an actual living even though it's not something I truly love. I go to school. I get my stuff done and only have like 1-2 hours of free time for myself to relax. I'm in this group chat with 13 people and it's just pure druggy material. I've known quite a number of these people since 5th grade ish and now all they concentrate on is alcohol and drugs. These people are just mainly like people you would say hi to or something not someone I would hang around with after school or something like that. Only like two of them I've known and hung out truly and overtime it's just began to fall apart. They don't want to hang out with me anymore and I don't want to go down the path they are going. I've just fallen in this hole where I don't think I'll becoming out of. I've thought about dating or just hanging out with a girl but I'm not really sure how too. I've really never spoken to any girls. The only time I would is for like projects or something. This one girl I have no idea who she really is. I know what her name but know nothing about her but I've seen her in the halls many times and I'll see her glancing at me but I have no idea if it's just she's looking at me or if she's looking at something near but I'm not really sure. I'm not sure if I say something or not I'm not really sure. I'm just so lonely that life to me seems so uninteresting. I've never thought about suicide because no matter how bad life may seem I believe that you only get one and to waste it because I'm having just a hard time socially is just a stupid thing to do. I'm not really sure how to continue on from here and how to improve my life.","1"
"I wanted to lay out my personal problems here because it's 1 AM and there's nothing better to do. I'll explain myself: I feel like I have no identity, no real sense of interests, and I go around feeling like a perpetual phony. This might be called the ""imposter syndrome,"" but being aware of that doesn't make the situation any better. I feel as though I'm a ""functional depressive,"" meaning, I'm able to get out of bed and go to school, but I have an evergrowing emptiness inside.I have a few ideas as to why I am the way I am, perhaps I just may have learned this throughout my upbringing. I mainly remember often being the butt of my sister and her friend's torment, but this was just mostly chalked up to the bigger sister making fun of her little sister. My mother was extremely odd in her parenting. On one hand, she would be extremely overprotective of me, often not allowing me to do certain things independently far past the due date of it being developmentally appropriate. For example, I was not allowed to bathe myself alone until I was 11, despite I was more than capable at my dad's house. She would be so worried about my projects in class that, instead of letting me do them or doing them with me, she would do the entire project herself. This lasted until I finally didn't tell her about a science project, did it myself, and got a C (a C that I earned though!).But then there was the other side of her. It's hard to describe it because it wasn't like I was beaten or starved or anything, but there was the sense of being ashamed in the air from her. The first memory I have of this was in kindergarten where my teachers suspected something was up because I did not appear to be able to hear them. After hearing tests were done and that was ruled out, the teachers were looking into other testing to determine if there was anything wrong. Upon a phone call from the school, she became irate and yelled, ""My daughter's not retarded!"" and hung up. It seemed from then on she didn't like me or wanted me around. She was never mean in her wording, in fact, the vagueness just makes it all the more confusing. For example, we would often make plans to go out shopping, out to eat, or the like. When the time came for her to pick me up from my dad's house, she would be a no call, no show. Not even a ""Sorry sweetie, I got caught up at work,"" or ""I'm not feeling well today, can we reschedule?"" I have no clue as to why she would do this over and over repeatedly to me. My other situation was with my dad. I felt my dad does genuinely love me and care for me, but I don't know how to communicate well with him. Since I was little, I displayed several of my ""eccentricities,"" and my dad would either respond with teasing or anger to these, depending on the situation. I remember in 2nd or 3rd grade, I had a fill-in-the-blank worksheet with a word bank. I decided for whatever reason I would cross them all off before I had fully completed the sheet. When I asked for help, he got all mad because he couldn't see the words and asked me why I would do something dumb like that. Of course, all I could say was something weird like, ""So I don't have to cross them out later."" but instead of being something cute little kids do it was just met with frustration.Later on, as I became a weirdo teenager, I began having several interests, though ""eccentric."" I was a big fan of Homestar Runner and would make references to the show (that no one got because no one watched it). I started expanding what music I liked, so I liked edgy mcedge ska punk like Reel Big Fish or Big D & the Kids Table. But then came the teasing from my dad. My dad was always the person to do the dad jokes and make fun of me because I'm the baby of the house. But it felt like it went overboard to the point where everything I liked was a point to poke and prod me. I had gotten a GameCube for Christmas, and I wanted to get Animal Crossing. This was near the end of the GC's lifespan, so it was only $20. I had money at home so I asked Dad if he could buy it and I'd pay him back at home. He began making fun of it because it looked ""dumb"" and ""for babies"" and started making ""goo-goo ga-ga"" noises at me. I tried to explain I heard nothing but good reviews for it and tried to tell him about the game but he just kept shutting me down. Finally, after wittling me to tears, he had some sort of explanation of, ""I just don't want you to get ripped off.""I became paranoid of displaying any interest in front of him. I got caught playing Windwaker once, and he said it looked like some ""Santa Claus game why are you playing that."" So then I would either play with the volume muted and turn off the TV if I heard the doorknob move. I would play music so low so as to not hear it come out the earbuds if I took them off. I played crappy Korean MMORPGs online and would minimize the screen whenever someone came in because I didn't want to be made fun of. This fear grew into not sharing things with others out of fear it would be a point in making fun of me for liking the ""wrong"" things. It was easier to try and pass off, ""I don't like music."" to people than to even mention one band I liked. I became very stilted in grabbing new interests because I'm scared of liking bad things and it being room for torment. For many things, I can't tell you if I liked it or not, because my mind has adapted this ambivalent attitude towards things. I have a few rare exceptions, such as liking ELO, but this may be due to this being a more ""socially acceptable"" interest. But I couldn't rattle on many interests than that because there's an apathy towards most things. If depression is, ""no longer finding interest in things that brought joy,"" then I'm, ""never had an interest to being with.""Then there was the bullying. I was always ""eccentric"" since I was a little kid, so this lead to me not having many friends, but the other kids and I would at least be able to coexist. Come 4th grade, the girls starting worrying about ""being grown up"" and I became a target for teasing from boys. The girls were mostly verbal in their bullying, whereas the boys would do stuff like push me or put gum in my hair that was brushed off with, ""Oh, he just likes you!"" The bullying got to the point where I had become a selective mute. Often, the kids would mimic everything I said, so I became unsure of myself in anything, even when I was right. For example, in 7th grade, we had to write some sort of paper, and the teacher said we could use the thesaurus or dictionary to help us (this was before everyone had smartphones). She was really finicky about us getting up without her permission, so I raised my hand and asked if I could use the thesaurus. The kids started laughing over this because I ""used a big word for dictionary,"" to which I tried to explain that they were two separate things, which just made them mimic everything I was saying in this squeaky voice. I became selectively mute, only speaking when absolutely necessary, and I just endured them hurting me in other ways, from stealing my stuff to spitting on me.I went from being the ""gifted"" child that made the dean's list to complete C average student in 4th grade on. My dad would just tease me with, ""Cs get [don't] get degrees!"" or wouldn't accept any of my grades because ""I could do better."" I became hopeless when it felt like I would try my hardest to get honor roll, and then be questioned why I didn't have all As. If I had an A in the class but got a single bad grade on an individual assignment, I would get grounded. I gave up trying altogether, only doing the absolute bare minimum to maintain a C because it was easier to just accept fate than to try and fight it. So today, it leaves me with a lot of anxiety in college. I'll often either overstress on an assignment, or procrastinate and panickily get it done last minute. I've gotten all A's so far in my college career, and I have a full scholarship until I get my associate's, so many people who know me from college know me as being ""smart."" I constantly get praise from teachers for writing strong papers, and other students give me praises for my presentations and such. But anytime I hear it, it feels like this twinge of anxiety flowing through me. I don't like it when the attention is focused on me because it makes me feel uncomfortable. It's like getting that sweater from Granny for Christmas; you know she has a lot of meaning to it, you know you should say thank you, but it puts you in this uncomfortable situation. I can't ever feel my work is ""good enough"" because I feel no frame of reference of what ""good enough"" is because I don't think I'm good enough.So, to summarize: I don't gain any interests because I have an anxiety that those interests are ""bad"" or ""wrong,"" I have a perpetual fear of being made fun of, I have no confidence in my academic abilities despite physical proof of accomplishments, I get anxious when I get any praise, and as such, I have no sense of identity or who I am. I feel like I hate myself but I don't even know who I am. ","1"
"I've been battling depression and anxiety for years. It has recently gotten to the point where I HAD to do something about it. I have zero energy. I wake up some mornings and wish I didn't. I'm pushing my family away and feel irritated by them a lot, and I feel so guilty about it. I sleep too much. Everything is gone. Colors aren't bright. Music doesn't sound good. Food doesn't taste good. Nothing feels good. I don't want to do anything or be around anyone. I wish I could go somewhere where no one I know could ever come or find me. I went to my GP and I think she's an idiot. She started me on Lexapro 10 mg a day and Vistaril for anxiety. The Lexapro is ehh. I can't say I'm loving it. I think it's made some difference but I'm still so fucking depressed. I had to stop taking the Vistaril because it was so goddamn awful. Made my anxiety worse, gave me nightmares, did nothing but sleep. I feel like I'm drowning. I want to run and scream in every direction. It gets to the point where you stop looking for the light at the end of the tunnel because you're just so sick of the fucking tunnel. I try to act as normal as possible around my family so they don't suspect it's as bad as it is. I have no friends. No gf. I'm so lonely. It's like suffocating. I have an appt with a psychiatrist in a week but I'm afraid nothing will help. What if it never gets better? That's what I keep thinking. I can't live like this for another 80 years. ","1"
"I am a junior in college and have always thought I wasn't made for school but I am ready to drop out. I talked to my professors about my depression and how hard it is to do anything... the ones that were understanding are starting to get fed up with me and the others just see me as a slacker. My boyfriend is incredible and if it wasn't for him understanding what I'm going through and being able to cheer me up idk what I would've done to myself by now. I used to not even be able to think the word suicide but now I daydream about what ways to do it. Being a mom one day used to be the only thing that kept me going but now I don't even want to raise a child in this world nor do I think I'll ever have enough money. I am an education major and $70,000 in debt and now I don't even think that's what I want to do in life. I started Prozac this summer and felt amazing but it quickly faded. It made me feel so awake I couldn't even nap, but now I can never get out of my bed. My room is a disaster, I can't even take proper care of my cats.. I'm disgusted with myself and I don't know what to do anymore. I've tried to get myself to go to the school counselor for weeks but when the time comes to go I can't get out of bed.

Zero motivation to do anything, bombing out of my university course, literally finding it impossible to even get up in the mornings, sleeping for 15 hours a night. Cannot see any future for myself. I have (literally!) no friends, hate people, social events of all kinds, hate working, hate not-working, just hate. So tired all the time. How do I get out of this?

"I dont how to shake this, I always suffered from depression just hide it with a smile. I was in a long term relationship that I should have walked away from. I was verbal and physically abused thru the whole thing. She always complained about me not showing her enough attention. I tried but I could really do it. One day she came home and said we are done and you need to move out. I did the next day she texted me and said she cheated. I was at a lost for words. I did what I always do and hid my feelings. She traded in my car about 1 month later I took that with a smile. I moved jobs since we worked together. I thought I was ok until about 3 weeks ago. It hit me the depression I hide my feelings well I always have. I have never been really happy. I think the break up just made it worst. Now I just sit in my bed try and sleep. Wake up in the morning go to work and smile like everything is ok. Its not I am always sad, I always feel alone. I think I really need to talk to someone. I tried and talk to my family but in the black community they really dont understand. All they say is you will be ok or just get over it. I feel like if I let it go on any longer no telling how bad it will get. I dont know why I have been this way my whole life. Its sucks I dont wanna lose control and let this win. I wanna be happy like normal people. Sorry for the grammatical errors not really paying attention. Lol. ","1"
"Feels like a dark alley I can't walk out of.. heres the backstory. This is all new to me, i've never felt the actual feeling of being depressed... so here it goes.. 8 months ago (i know this might sound minor, but my ex meant/still mesns the world to me) my ex and I broke up, we had some issues that ended up being the end of us. For the firdt 7 months i was ok, i had seemed to have forgotten her. We lived to gether and i missed that but for the most part i was doing fine. Then october hit.. she messaged me asking if we could talk, saying her boyfriend had broken up with her, cheated on her etc. Well, we talked, and all of a sudden i felt the connection again.. fast forward 4 days later, and she is back at the house with me. This is where things take a down turn. A month goes by and she says she doesnt wanna be eith anyone, which i respected and understood. Even though deep down i knew i missed her. I have 2 cars, and she didnt have one, and she needed to beable to get a job and get to work, and me being me, am letting her use the car. I got so down a few days later that I told her we needed to talk. I told her i loved her and that i wanted her back. She looked me in my face and said there was no chance in hell we would ever get back together.. that crushed me. And then the next night, there she is, talking to other guys, doing whatever, and she left her phone out, i saw a message that was sent to her, and i just lost it. I lost my job, literally everything but my cars and my house. And she has the other car. She left the other night and hasnt messeged me in days. This is where it gets hard. She told me to just move on. Ive noticed that i dont wanna leave and go out anywhere, i dont have interest in literally anything. I feel hopeless. She was all i had in the world, literally. And i realize that i have no one. I have never felt so alone, manipulated, sad, or depressed in my entire life. This is tough. I literally never thought i'd feel this way. And the worst part is shes all i can think about. I havent eaten in 2 days. I cant sleep, nothing means anything to me. It sounds dramatic ik, but i literally am in the darkest place ive ever been. Call me weak but ive contemplated suicide atleast 3 times because of how painful this is. Im not sure why, but it is the worst pain ive ever felt. Its not just heartbreak, its knowing that the only.person you.thought you had doesnt even want to be there anymore. Im falling... hard. I dont even have the strength to tell get my car back, while she partys, and who knows what. For the first time in my life, i dont know what to do. I have no money, no job, and no drive to do anything. Its a nightmare i cant wake up from. Some days i wake up and wonder why i didnt just die in my sleep. This sounds dramatic. But i assure you its not , its real, and its horrible. I dont know how to fix this. Im broken. I need help. Someone to talk to. This is the worst thing ive ever felt.","1"
"I am 26 have been depressed since before I was 10, or at least showed signs that I can recognize. I have pushed everyone who has ever cared about me away and now I am so alone and isolated.  I have screwed myself over so many times and made so many mistakes in my life. They weigh on me and haunt me. I recently had someone who cared and said they wouldn't leave me or judge me. I told them everything and they helped me start getting better, but all of a sudden they left me and broke every promise they ever made me. I am more alone now than I have ever been. I was numb before they came into my life and now I feel it all again.  I wish I could go back to being numb, I wish I could remember how it felt to be normal or okay.

"Hey there. First, I'd love to thank you for wanting to read this. It will help, I'm sure. So, I am a teenage girl and it seems like I've lost all motivation to do things I used to enjoy. For example, I loved reading back when it was summer, but now I don't find it entertaining at all, and what I've noticed is that I get interested in a certain thing, but after some time it just becomes...boring. School is literally expecting a lot from us and I'm not even used to having free time. It's just work. All day. Every day. My brain just won't shut down. It's annoying and I want to relax for once yet I can't due to my non-stop thinking. I have no friends, my self confidence is zero, and I'm just tired of everything.I know I shouldn't be feeling this way since I'm young and I'm supposed to act like it and be happy and social, and that I'll have many more things to worry about in the future (job, bills etc.). I can't wait to go to sleep. It's the only way to actually do something that won't make me tired and unmotivated. I have no goals in life, my future seems hopeless, I don't even know who I am, nor what I'm supposed to do with my life. Honestly, even my job is a mystery. Nothing appeals to me, and I think that no matter what, I'll never find happiness expect in helping others. They normally just make fun of me no matter how hard I try to be a good friend. I'm a deep and emotional person who just wants to make the world a better place. However, I don't have a clue what to do anymore. I'm often excaustd and all I want to do is sleep and relax. Even watching movies is becoming dull. I don't have the patience anymore. There are many exams coming up and I don't know how I'm going to do it. I sometimes feel like a terrible person, like I'm a monster deep down even though I know it isn't true. I literally don't like myself at all. My self-confidence is on the lowest possible level. I think I'm never going to find love and even if I did, they are going to cheat on me or something. I feel like I don't deserve to be loved or to be happy.Maybe I'm more like an elder than a teen, I don't know. Smiling is what I rarely, almost never do. It's just pointless. I hate parties and I'm introverted. My energy level is low too. Recently I started watching a cartoon,it made me excited for some time, but soon stopped. Why can't I laugh and have fun like most teens do? I'm very anxious and people think I'm strange and different. I don't mind. In fact, it's a good thing, but I dislike school very much. Crowds also make me feel miserable. I seriously have no idea why is this happening. I'm not sure when it all began, thought. If someone could give me advice, I'd really appreciate it.

"For the past while I've felt off and I'm still not sure what's wrong but. I think I have something called depersonalization and derealization disorder. It's the only explanation for what's going on. But no one believes me. I've told my mom. My councillors. Friends. They all just think it's made up or tell me not to look to the internet. They say it's normal and happens to everyone and will pass. But it's 5 months later and it's only gotten worse and I feel like I'm insane and no one believes me and I don't know what to do. ","1"

"A girl I knew for 3 years left, without a word, or even a goodbye. I spoke to her all day, every day. Fell in love with her, dated her, broke up with her and had a solid friendship for months after the breakup. One day she went. Blocked me on everything and I have no way of contacting her ever again. She was all I had and now I've got nothing","1"
"Heart broken there she stands; A nobody reaches out their hand.   She grasps heart content; love and passion is his intent. Quick to anger because he cares; he never lets go as no one else cares. Struggles and trials bind them closer; mistakes made as he tries to know her. Tears pour as a torrential rain; only she can numb his pain. He loves her dearly but cant express; the everlasting feeling does he obsess. The answer is yes, she never leaves his mind; true love has finally been bind. His heart yearns for her approval; never to upset hurt or gain her disapproval. Without her his mind is not true; from the bottom of my heart I love you, or is it hate? Obsessed distraught wanting to end it all. Please I loved you whyd you let me fall. I gave mine for yours, happiness, but still broke is your soul. I failed and always will, nothing helps end end end. Should I love her, she is in a inescapable maze, forgive and forget, am I capable. Lacerations deep fixed with staples. sealed like my mind confined and alone, no no no NO!","1"
"  I've been a perpetual visitor of a pretty dark place for, I would say, the past 5-6 years of my life, currently about to reach my 20s in a few months. I don't really know where to turn to, so I'd just do it here.  I come from a background of many a conflict, between my parents and relatives. I've been leading most of my life parentless with one passing early in my lifetime and the other... just deciding to not be there. This has left me pretty traumatised and I've never been given the proper attention for medicating my trauma.  I remember myself as a go-getter type of kid, exploring my tiny city even before I was in school, making many friends both young and old, but my caretaker managed to quickly turn me away from this lifestyle and since the 1st grade I qickly sank into the personality of an introvert, never leaving his room, only playing games on his low-end computer - something that turned quickly into a passion of mine, but something, I was forever ridiculed for.  Since entering the 8th grade, I have been constantly arguing with my other housemates, not really family members, turning my life into an even bigger hell. Thus reaching a point of no return - I find it painstakingly difficult to return home, since I don't really have one to return to. These people never stopped harping on me, I was never good enough for them and was considered the black sheep of the family. Me trying to connect with my indifferent parent or me showing a tiny bit of affection for my half-sibling were always frowned upon. You can imagine the state of mind I had back then and still have, how it continues to affect me, my goals and ambitions.  Long story short, I am now a university student on the road to failing his first year of language learning. My study schedule has been very disappointing up to now, I'm pursuing a Bachelor's degree in applied linguistics(English and Mandarin), but my more important subject is barely lectured. I basically have to do everything language-wise on my own, as I've tried before with Russian and not really succeeded, for reasons not due to the language being hard, etc., for the reference I'm too a native of a Slavic country. I'm giving my all to studying Mandarin while everything else goes to  and I remain listless about it.  Furthermore, living in a dorm has been complete and total hell. The neighbours are constantly loud and obnoxious, absolutely uncompliant with any of the dormitory rules. My roommate is more than a night owl - he barely sleeps, the room is constantly flashing with screens and monitors, we argue. I too can barely sleep since I've come here, hence why I'm typing this at 1AM in the morning.  I'm constantly up and down, this is why I absolutely avoid any alcohol, tobacco or drugs. I've drank on few occasions, happy ones, yet they've all ended with me barely saving face. I drink coffee, use it as a pick-me-up once or twice a day, but I do know that coffee and depression is not advised. I have suicidal thoughts once or twice a month, some situations exacerbate them of course. I've dwelled on the subject, I'm too py to even try and attempt it. Going to bed is a chore, since I toss and turn, barely falling asleep. Waking up is a chore, since I have to start another day of this...  I've gone on for too long. I really need someone to at least tell me it will be okay or give me some tips with how to handle myself better. As affirmed above, I have no family to turn to and pestering my few friends is out of the question, because I know their own life happenings and I know they wouldn't have time for me.  Please help me.","1"
"I have been with my boyfriend for nearly two years and he has always been by my side, even before we were dating. I suffer from depression, anxiety, and borderline bipolar disorder. The littlest things make me upset and I either go off on him or bottle up my emotions and push him away. My boyfriend has recently told me that hes lost count of how many times Ive pushed him away, and I feel like hes just getting sick and tired of having to take care of me and put up with me BS. Im trying to work on my behavior and try to become a better girlfriend but its really hard to not let the little stuff bother me. And then I feel like its just a stupid thing to get bothered over that I just bottle them up inside. Then when my boyfriend understands that Im upset he wont stop pressuring me to tell me whats wrong. I just need some help. I want this relationship to work out. Its been the longest relationship that either of us have been in and I really want to keep him in my life. What should I do? ","1"
"What up, I'm a soldier in some army.I stay in my base for two weeks at a time with a few days that I can go home.My base consists of guys and girls and we all live in something resembling college dorms. Thus, the social life in here is very thriving.Lately I suffer from mood swings that range from just me (tired, happy, outgoing just like a normal dude) to this angry, life hating lump)I do seek professional help (phycologist) as it is offered here but with no positive effects yet.I have plenty of genuine friends and everything is fine expect of me. Sometimes I just react to some catalyst that could trigger me to go into that state.I've reached a point where I GENUINELY want to be able to not talk anyone (small talk, friends etc) and just be isolated. Problem is I sometimes snap out of this and everything is normal. But I fucking hate those extreme mood swings which literally drive me insane as I'm writing this just to vent because my friend will give me that positive advice as they do not really understand what's going on,  me also when I think about it.I just want to do my duty as a soldier, keep my commanders happy, finish my work day, work out and get 8 hours of sleep.THAT'S IT, I get sharper when I'm in this state and feel healthier as I stay static and don't shift aroundThanks to whoever read.

"Hello RedditI haven't been on here in quite some time and I don't know if this is the right place to turn to but I'm desperate.As stated in the title, I'm looking for a blog or podcast that can help me get out of this rut I've been in for quite some time. I'm normally very passionate about food and love eating but I barely eat anymore and have lost a significant amount of weight. I've gone from hardly sleeping at all to sleeping all the time. I was once a fairly confident individual but now have severe self-esteem issues. It's now affecting my personal and professional life and I'm starting to not care.I suppose I'm looking for something inspirational, confidence boosting, self love... anything really.ThanksEdit Just to give you a little info about myself, I am a LGBT individual who returned to Canada after nearly a year of travelling. Depression hit before I returned but has only gotten worse after 4 months of being back. Currently dealing with a failed relationship, had to move back in with my parents in my hometown which has little to no LGBT community and I'm struggling to find work. If anyone can suggest a specific blog that may suit me better please let me know but I am open to practically anything.","1"
"About 10 years ago I lost the ability to trust people, it started after a long time friend who I had helped out by convincing my housemate to let him live with us, went on a vendetta to destroy me, for reason I still dont understand. It all started when he broke up with his gf, I had recently star ed a relationship which I think pissed him off, he had no where to go so me being the nice person I am convinced my housemate to let him move in. All was going well for a month until I started to notice things like, my myspace (yeah that long ago) would be open or my phone would be in different places or unlocked. He started acting weird when I would have my girlfriend over and would always try to set me up like inviting a bunch of girls around expecting me to hook up with one of them, it wasnt until I jumped on my gfs phone to grab a number that I saw he had been messaging her all the time. He was telling her everything I did and said , he even lied to make me look like a scumbag. We ended up having to move out and I tried to rid myself of him, by this time my gf had worked his shit out and wanted nothing to do with him, thats when I found out he had gained access to my msn messenger account, downloaded my contacts and added them to his account and started to see interrogate every single girl on there trying to find anything to use against me, when that didnt work he just decided to brick my house spread lies about me and try to turn everyone against me.  It put a stain on my relationship and I believe it was a major part of why we broke up.Its been nearly a decade and I still have trouble trusting people, I am always waiting for them to show their true motives, or they are planing to screw me over or attempt to humiliate me. Tl/Dr: Helped a friend out in time of need and he went out of my way to destroy my life  and now I cant trust people. ","1"
"What is your story? How are you working on it?","1"
"So recently my life has been turned upside down. And I dont really know where to go from here. Im trying to move on but I just feel....not real. Iv always been depressed, even took meds as a child. I was a bad cutter in my younger years. But recently I just....I dont know. About a month  ago I got out of jail. I went to jail in the first place for grand larceny of a firearm. I stole the gun a year ago to pay rent. I sold it. And I paid my rent so I could be closer to my daughter. Yes I know. Dumbass mistake. And you know I did my time. I did 2 months in jail for it, and now Im out on probation. But you know its hard. Its VERY hard. No one will hire me. I use to be able to go to Walmart, or target and find a job for the season. Nope. Not anymore. I have a wife, and she is working and she tells me all the time she is just physically tired. I know she is. And everyday she comes home I try to make it better. I clean the house. Do the dishes. Take care of our cats. But I know its not good enough as it would if I was bringing home money. Im trying. Im putting in applications everywhere, and calling them up after a couple days. But I feel like I should just go back to jail. It was easier for everyone so they wouldnt have to worry about me. Im scared if I fuck up just once on anything. Even something little, Ill be heading back to jail. I dont know what to do. Im trying you guys. I really am trying. I just...I just feel like Im getting to the end of my story. And as much as I dont want my story to end for whatever reason, I feel its going to end. I just needed to get these things out.

"How do I fix my relationship? We always argue and things haven't been going well lately to the point of him actually trying to leave. I know that I fuck up in the relationship sometimes and I don't have a job right now but it doesn't seem like it's all my fault but he always puts the blame on me. He loves rubbing things in my face and makes sure to tell me that he's better then me but I love him and I just wanna fix this... It wasn't always like this, especially in the beginning of the relationship. He just doesn't trust me, always thinking that I am going to cheat on him. He swears he cares about me yet it doesn't feel like he's trying anymore. I don't know how to talk to him anymore... Anytime I try to talk about how I feel about anything it just ends in an argument about how what I feel is wrong.","1"
"Im 16 and Im super depressed. I try to hide it and never really talk about it. My parents have been split up since I was a baby and it really doesnt bother me. This summer though I went to visit my dad who lives 5 hours away by plane and stayed there for a month. I really missed my cats while I was gone. We had 2, and I try not to like prefer one over the other but there is one cat that really liked me more than anyone else and I really liked him. I have had him since I was 6 or 7 and I felt really close with him. When I came back from visiting my dad, my mom told me that he had run away and hasnt been back for almost 2 weeks. I was really sad and I spent hours looking for him, and made a bunch of signs. He still hasnt came back, and we always check our local pet shelter, and even their DOA cats, and he hasnt been there at all. I know its just like a pet but it feels like losing a best friend or a family member. And I always feel guilty because I feel like he ran away looking for me because I wasnt there. I have lately been super depressed and constantly thinking about him. Its impossible to function and I feel like my life is fucking horrible and I cant get over it. I really dont know what to do. None of my friends know about this and talking to people about stuff like this really doesnt help me, except over the internet where I can stay anonymous. Thanks to anyone who actually took the time to read all this shit I just needed a place to get it off my chest.","1"
"Hi.  Throwaway account here.  Im a 36 yr old guy, divorced 3 years ago.  Our son is about to turn 5 and due to my job working 10 hour night shifts, I only see him on the weekends.  My job is physically demanding, I come home aching every day and can barely use my hands without a lot of pain.   I live in a shitty 1 bedroom house so when my sons here, I sleep on the couch.  I dont get time to myself to relax unless I call in sick for work.   I dont sleep well, especially on weekends since my son wakes up early.  I have no motivation or energy.  Havent cleaned the house in months.  I have one friend.  My ex is a less than ideal mom so it feels like I have to do extra during my 2 days with him to make up for the shitty 5 days she has him.   I cant stop thinking about how this wont change, or that Im too old to change, and that my best is behind me.  Ive been on antidepressants for years and they havent helped at all.

"hi my name is mark im 15 and a freshman and just recently ive been getting depressed regularly. just some background first, im 511 and about 170~ pounds and in a friend group of around 7 boys including me. ive never really been depressed before, all through middle school and elementary school i was a genuinely happy person. but ever since september ive never felt worse and everyday is worse than the last and every week feels like some endless schedule and the only light is waiting for my next smoke, or next holiday. my friends constantly destroy my self confidence by saying the girl i like will never ever like me back even though we are good friends i am now throughly convinced that she is disgusted by the thought of me. every picture of myself i look at disgusts me, and i hate everything about myself. my grades are slipping, where they used to be straight As they are now Cs and falling. and on top of that my dad is constantly pressuring me to be a different person, to give up smoking and work out and get better grades and i want to do all of that but i have absolutely no motivation for anything anymore, i cant find happiness in the simplest things, and everyone doesnt like me. and i cant find new friends either, because my old ones would ruin my life my constantly spreading a bad word about me and making fun of me. my friend group is probably the most influential in our grade, so everyone would quickly catch on and i would become an outcast loser like so many others before me. homework is piling up on me but i have no motivation to do it, as soon as i get home i want to sleep and escape this world. i havent told anyone besides my best friend and my sister because i feel like im a pussy and half the people are experiencing life three times worse but suck it up so i keep it inside and i dont tell anyone but i feel like if i dont get help soon idk how bad itll get. sorry for the bad english its 1:30 am and im not the best writer ","1"

"So call me over dramatic if youd like but Id have a very shitty child hood. Ive been abused by my father Ive been put down by multiple people, Ive been used played and cheated on in many relationships. But I take responsibility for that since Im so gullible, anyways I just met someone who changed me she wanted to help me when she saw how.. blank I was. No emotion what so ever I was just a blank canvas with no expressions because of what Ive been through. We were together for a year and she was feeling like the relationship wasnt fair to me and wasnt healthy for us both. Since we only saw each other once a week and sometimes we wouldnt see each other then. One day she just decided it was time to separate. Two days after our anniversary we broke up. I started to feel my old self creep back into the picture. I lost all motivation to do anything my ability to work hard wasnt there anymore. But she told me she still saw a future with me. And that got my hopes up and I told myself  You know what you cant let this get the better of you. You told you how you felt how much she meant to you, dont let that all go to waste. That was my motivation. It all came back, then recently I asked again.. I dont know why I did but I just asked for confirmation I guess. And she just ignored me she looked at the message but ignored me. Then when she responded she just gave me dead responses as if she doesnt want to talk to me. So then these thoughts came to my mind like It was all a lie she was just using you, just playing you. She just said those things to shut you up. I foolishly believed those thoughts. I went and took a knife put it to my wrist and I pressed it against it, my plan was to go vertically just so it gave results not for attention. My thoughts on suicide arent the norm. I never wanted to commit suicide in my life. I never contemplated it but this was different, I felt as if I wasnt there. That it wasnt me going through with the act, it was something else but I just.. somehow snapped out of it and I went and just cried. Im ok now kinda but I just feel like shit. Just extremely shitty and I still feel kinda depressed. Not even kinda I just do. I dont know what to do. Sorry for making it too long. You can respond if youd like I just thought itd be good to share.Update: I wish I could say things have gotten better but shit just got worse. Now I just sit in darkness. Go to work come home sit in darkness rinse and repeat. Im probably just gonna rid myself of all social media I just want be left alone now.","1"
"Hey guys, So I've been dating this girl (lets call her Stacy) for close to 9 months. she's basically had a mental breakdown in college and never finished as a result, mental hospital, self harm the whole nine yards. I managed to convince her to come back to college (she really wanted to, she's only missing 2 classes to graduate) and for the most part she's been doing fine. decent grades and all. she's also been getting help and has been on meds for a month or so now.she has good days and bad days and worse days. today she told me she doesn't think she's gonna be able to graduate because she has to do a long research paper and present it. she also has terrible anxiety so presentations would actually be really hard for her. everytime she's said that she's not gonna graduate i reassure her that I believe in her and that i know she's going to be able to finish.today she told me to stop encouraging her like that because she felt like it meant failure was not an option and that if she did fail it'd mean i don't love her and i'd be disappointed in her. this left me speechless because i felt terrible that i was pressuring her like this and wasn't aware of it. what can i do to convince her that graduating is possible for her without pressuring her?","1"
"Hello, i'm new to reddit. I decided to make an account as a last ditch effort to find meaning/purpose in life. I have had thoughts of suicide for the past couple years and I've been able to calm the voices with marijuana. I don't necessarily want to kill myself, nor do I think death is the ultimate answer. I need help. Okay, here's my issue. I have low self esteem, this stems from my forehead being 50% of my head, this is amplified by the fact that my hairline is receding at an exponential rate. I also am pretty short (5'9) I am 23 years old and I attend university. While looking around at the world I live in, I get sad. We live in a world full of hate and judgement. I wear a hat 95% of the time, even when i'm at home. I have been shaving my head for about a year now and it has only amplified my depression. If I don't wear a hat in public, I feel like I turn heads. I can have the best dream ever, wake up happy as hell, but when I look in the mirror I get instantly sad. My depression is also taking a toll on my social life, I spend 75% of my time lying in bed, not because I don't want to do anything, but because I feel like my appearance entitles me to be hidden away. I understand that with time balding is just another thing that happens with old age. I started balding when I was 17, noticeably when I was 21 and I shaved it at 22. Now here's the thing that really makes me sad, when I have my hat on i'm a completely different person; i'm happy, fun to be around and I smile. Without a hat I am a bitter old man, I look like a young blue eye Bruce Willis. I have had a couple girlfriends in the past and they were absolutely stunning, a bit crazy, but beautiful nonetheless. This was when I had hair. I may sound like a dramatic baby and you may say that you're lucky, other people have it much worse, but right now i'm hurting and my mother can see it. I moved away from home when I was 19 and just recently moved states to live with them (temporary) and this may have something to do with why i'm feeling so low recently. I guess what i'm looking for from the reddit community is some guidance. I want to be a wealthy family man with beautiful loving wife and children. But I believe my depression may end that dream before it can even start. I am a fairly intelligent individual, but my grades do not reflect that. I use to have a lot of friends, but no one wants to be around a fun sucker. I just want to look in the mirror and be OKAY with what I see. I want to do fun things and have friends again. I want to date. I want to be my old self. I've lost people and i've been broken for some time now. I just want to be happy.","1"
"So, currently I am sitting in my bed. I am 16 years old currently attending a college course that I might soon be kicked out of as I cannot concentrate and too tired to focus and work. I'm finding it hard telling anyone at the college so I'm kinda fucked, I'm trying to tell people at home about it but in struggling with that too. I can't even answer simple questions like ""what are you working on"" ""what's that image of"", takes me forever to come up with a answer which is like ""an eye"" or something really stupid so everyone laughs at me.I also think I'm catching feelings for my best friend who I feel like another 'human' to, and I'm also trying to get her a man... I got in a big crash last week Wednesday, on my push bike which lead to it being broken and took the only joy out of my life for a good while (Mountain Biking).I also need to try and get a job but I have no motivation to do so what so ever,I'm loosing friendsBut the worst part of all is that I can't feel shit about this, I can't even concentrate on my own thoughts for 5 minutes to make myself feel shit, I wanna cry, I wanna feel shit so I cut myself, I wanna just feel like total utter shit so I end up killing myself, why can't I feel shit.I just feel nothing.","1"
"This might get a little long. I have some other social media and a lot of online friends but I don't want to dump this on them.I don't know how to begin this so I'll just jump right in. I think have some sort of undiagnosed mental illness. From a young age, I was extremely prone to temper tantrums and outbursts towards my family. They were always caused by something very minor, like being forced to do a chore, brush my extremely tangled hair, or do difficult schoolwork. These have gotten less common and less severe, but things do happen sometimes, still. I have always felt a disconnect between my parents and me. I stopped telling them I loved them when I was very young, and I've even told them I hated them a couple times when I was younger. I never used (and still usually don't) use basic polite words like please and thank you towards my family. I don't really do it now unless I feel really obliged, but I try to pay attention to when someone does something nice for me and try not to inconvenience them for a period of time afterward that I deem appropriate. I do use polite phrases towards anyone outside my family, though. I don't understand the logic, either. Saying things like ""I love you"" or ""I'm sorry"" in front of my family genuinely makes me feel uncomfortable and pathetic like I'm showing weakness to someone who shouldn't be seeing it. I'm almost comically infamous in my family for being rude. I took note of this as a younger child. Whenever my family pointed out a problem with my personality, I felt bad and it would lower my self-esteem. Around the age of 9 or so, I used to print out pictures of myself to vandalize with drawn-on injuries or rude words like ""fat"" or ""die"". I seemed to always have a sense of guilt and empathy for my family that I couldn't, and still can't, translate into my actions. When I was younger, my view of myself didn't come up that often. Every once in a while, though, I would spend a couple nights crying because even though I had friends, I felt unloved and worthless as a person. Not even my stuffed animals or my dog loved me, in my mind.I've had to go to two therapists before the age of 14. It never was because I was sad, really, because I don't think my family knows I'm sad. I was just being a burden to others because of my occasional outbursts.The main cause of a lot of my emotional issues would be from treatment from my mom. When I was in 3rd grade, she had once grabbed me in the midst of an argument and told me something along the lines of, ""You have to respect me. I could kill you,"" which then caused me to flee from my house, only to come back and lock myself in the guest room with a kitchen knife, shouting at my mom through the door that ""we're even because now I could kill you, too."" There was another incident after that, involving an argument that caused my mom to downright tell me that I was a terrible person. I'm sure there were some less significant things in between, but those are the two that really manage to fuck me up to date.At a certain age, depression started becoming a normal thing for me. In around 5th grade, I started performing mild self-harm. I still sometimes have phases of depression where I stay in my room all day, and only leave once a day to binge eat, after which I retreat back to my room. I don't even necessarily use the bathroom or shower unless it gets really bad. I had a habit of taking excessive amounts of pills for no reason other than to make myself feel worse or to normalize the concept of an overdose in my mind so that eventual suicide would be easy one day (at some point I had decided I wanted to die at age 18 as my absolute lack of talent or skill would make it impossible for me to get a job or survive). Those phases come and go, a week or three of sadness and then a couple months of nothing. I stopped feeling quite as bad when I got into a relationship with one of my online best friends, and she quickly became my favorite person alive. Even then, I still feel like I'm not good enough for her and I don't like to burden her with my problems anymore. I also have slight commitment issues.I absolutely crave some sense of emotional or physical affection, but whenever it's given to me, I'm uncomfortable. Physical contact with pretty much all people makes me angry, and my parents trying to solve my problems makes me irritable and uncomfortable. Nowadays I spend all of my time in my room (I take online school), not even able to enjoy basic things sometimes because I hate myself so much physically and mentally that the mere fact that other people have to experience me in some way makes me feel ashamed or embarrassed. I'm very out of shape physically at this point and lack all motivation to fix this. I honestly just need to get this off my chest, any empathetic words or recommendations on how to live out the majority of my week semi-happily would be appreciated. I know this is very disorganized and there's not much that can be said in response to it, but I needed to vent it somewhere before I messaged a friend and forced my problems on them. If you honestly read this trash to the end, I'm grateful.","1"
"Im 18/F and Ive been depressed more or less since 5th grade. Battled with an eating disorder through all middle and high school and now Im a freshman in college. Ive never ever been popular. Always sort of outcast, we moved around a lot. Ive had a few different groups of friends through school but they either werent very open about things like this or they would tell me that I was just faking everything for attention.This past summer things were better, I started dating my current boyfriend we worked and traveled together all summer and I spent plenty of time with my friends. I was ecstatic for college.Fast forward to now. Classes are whatever. They arent really hard, but theyre pointless to me and I never ever find enjoyment in them (I used to love learning). I had a roommate who was awful and inconsiderate and I ended up moving into a different room. The girl there already had a friend move in so they both left and now Im alone in the room. Im a pretty talkative person but I cant manage to make a single friend on campus. My boyfriend lives 3 hours away and in another country  where he attends school so I never see him. Ive tried talking to him, but hes still stressed with school that we just end up fighting. Im just constantly mad at him and Ive found myself completely unable to communicate and tolerate him. I tried making an appointment with the university therapist and they put me on a wait list and told me it would be a few weeks.Ive started binge eating again, I have multiple nightmares nearly every night, I wake up constantly and I dont have anyone to turn to. Ive tried getting back into yoga and meditation like I used to, but I just cant do it. I have no idea what to do anymore. I cant talk to my family and I have no friends to speak of. Im just not sure what to do anymore. I know if I didnt still feel so tied to things in this world then I would go off the rails and probably kill myself, and I can feel myself distancing.I dont know what I wanted to accomplish by posting this, I guess I just wanted to get it all out there since I dont really have another way to. With the state of the world today, I have no hope for the future. I feel completely derailed from everything everyone told me my future would be and Im so lost. Thats really all I have to say, if you read all of this I just wanna say thanks, I do appreciate it and I hope you have a good rest of your day/night. ","1"
"I can't tell if I'm depressed or lazy. I mostly say this because I do spend a lot of time alone which I enjoy. But I do nothing. I just waste time on my phone tweeting and looking at memes and whenever I think maybe I should walk my dog or do something productive, I just think of how much energy it would take and how not worth it it would be anyways. Am I stupid? I just get bored of things so easily. I like being alone but I feel like something is missing in my brain like it's empty or something? Idk it's weird and I think I'm lazy but I also don't really enjoy doing many things at all so how can I even want to do anything? Edit: also whenever I try to put my energy towards something like writing etc. everything I say sounds dumb so I go back to the mindless things I mentioned before ","1"
"Hi all,I've been depressed for a few months, and while this is one of the worst bouts I've ever had, I'm not in any danger of hurting myself, and I know I will get through it eventually, because I've done it before.Here's the thing though, I've been pretty much ignoring all messages from friends and family, except for my housemate. I've been keeping my mother at bay by telling her I'm busy at work (true). I live on the opposite side of the planet to my entire family. The other thing, is that my mum is a worrier. Even though I'm in my 30s, I know that if I told her I have depression (I've never told her about any of my previous bouts), she would go insane and message me every single day asking if I'm still alive or sending me ridiculous home remedies. My family has a history of depression, and one member committed suicide because of it, so she has a solid basis for the worry.She just messaged me saying ""Have I done something wrong? Are you really so busy you can't even say hello?"" when really I just don't have the energy to keep up a conversation. So, the point of this long post is to ask, what do I say to her? I want to let her know I'm busy but also that it's really too much for me to carry out daily conversations at the moment, with anybody. That I do love her and I don't mean to hurt her but also that I need some space. But in, like, nice people words, you know, like someone currently capable of feeling emotion would say. :P Would really appreciate any help!TLDR; How to word nice message to my mum who thinks I'm ignoring her but really I just need some space right now.","1"
"I'll preface this by admitting I'm quite introverted. I enjoy my time alone but I also enjoy my somewhat small circle of friends.But I don't really go to parties or even hang out with people that often. I tend to sit alone and stew especially when a depressive episode hits.I have a job and and I take a couple college classes but lately I just feel like a zombie going through the motions.I want to go out and travel but I'm too broke to go anywhere farther than a few miles away and many of my friends have explored other countries or gone on road trips and I feel as though life is passing me by.I know this all sounds like a lot of whining and I realize many people have it so much worse but I just hate myself and feel like a lazy pos for not doing anything.I really just feel like a loser and there have been dark times where I really wanted to end it and I'm just sick of feeling this way.Is there something wrong with me?","1"
"We've had an amazing relationship up until this point. We're best friends. We never fight. We have plans for the future. We have so much in common & have so much fun together. From the second we met we were just crazy about each other.It's been about 6 months that I've noticed the depression setting in. He's having a hard time financially, stressed at work, & has family issues. It's been particularly bad the last month. He's still getting up to go to work during the week, but will come home & just watch tv all night. On the weekends he stays in bed all day, doesn't eat, doesn't shower. I've tried coaxing him out (we don't live together). I've suggested laid back date ideas; Netflix & chill nights, hikes, making dinner together, all low-key things that he enjoys, but he won't. We used to see each other Wed nights & he'd spend all weekend at my place. But I haven't seen him in 2 weeks. He declines all my offers to bring him a coffee, stop by for a short visit, or bring him food. Two weeks ago we talked about the depression & how bad it's gotten. He admits that he doesn't feel any enjoyment in life anymore. He's finally acknowledged how bad it's affecting him. He's agreed to see his Dr, and he's open to taking medication & seeing a therapist. These are huge steps! But for now it's just talk. His Dr appt is next week. Even if he starts medication next week, it could be months before he finds one that works for him & he starts feeling better. I love him dearly & feel so selfish for thinking of myself at this time. But I'm heartbroken. I'm so lonely, sad, & feel deserted. I honestly feel like if I didn't initiate texting or calling him, that I'd never hear from him. I know he still loves me. And I don't want him to see me as another 'thing' on his to-do list, something else needing his attention. He has enough on his plate right now. He doesn't need the burden of also hurting me.  This is where I'm torn, I'm so hurt by how he's been treating me. I feel like I'm not looking out for myself at this point. I'm putting his wellbeing before my own. I know he's going through a lot, but I'm also unhappy, I'm sad, I'm hurting. Do I cut ties & focus on myself? Hope that we can reconnect in a few months? Or do I keep being this saintly patient unselfish gf? Can things go back to how they were? ","1"
"Hello, I am a 15 M and I have been going through a lot recently in my life. Our family had a house fire my dad was in a motorcycle accident and was recently laid off. We have been living in a hotel for the past 2 months and i have been thinking to much. I recently thought about how my life has been shit so far. I was born with fucked up legs and the doctor accidentally messed up my arm. My arm is still messed up but my legs were fixed. The arm thing has limited me on many sports and when I had surgery on my legs I was in a wheelchair so I stayed inside and played games and ate when I was little causing me to gain weight. I also had a slower than avg metabolism which didnt help. I learned a bad eating pattern and now I regret it. I know I can lose weight but I havent had the motivation since everything that has been going on. I dont even know what I really want I just wanted to get my feelings out. Thanks for taking your time if you read this. Edit: I also wanted to say my friends have been not inviting me to things recently so I have like barley any friends atm.","1"
"Well you see the problem (or problems) is that I live with alcohol parents. Ive been in and out of foster homes many times now with my 3 younger sisters and my 2 younger brothers. I honestly wouldnt care if I died or went back into a foster home if it werent for my younger siblings. They really want to stay with my parents and I really want to stay with them. I love them so goddamn much. They are my world, theyre the only reason I want to live. So we stayed with them but they drink so goddamn much. Every single day theyre drunk. And right now my house is basically a party house because they let my auntie and her boyfriend and my stepdads best friend move in with us without even asking us. I also have another auntie whos here for the night and fuck theyre all drunk. My mom is pawned my brothers PS3 and PS4 and most of the games with them so they are pretty bored most of the time. They also leave me alone with my younger siblings alone to go drink for the night without even telling me, they just take off without word. But I dont think thats gonna happen anymore because my auntie and my stepdads friend are here now so thats more pressure off me. I only really have one person to talk to about my problems and thats my schools guidance counseler but thats only during the day and when I actually go to school and most of the time I need someone to talk to at other times like in the evenings and nights. Theyre always saying that theyre gonna go to programs to get help but they always fucking lie and Im sick of it. So if I stay here I gotta deal with all this shit and if I kill myself or run away Id be leaving my younger siblings alone with those shitheads. There was that third option of call child services to come pick us all up to get away from these fucks but then again my siblings would be extremely sad and depressed. Even right now I cant even fucking sleep because these fucks are partying and I wanna go to school tomorrow to talk to my guidance councillor. So reddit I guess this was more for me than anyone else and I just needed to get it off my chest. But Im gonna try my hardest to get my family the support it needs. I doubt anyone is going to see this because its on my profile rather than in a subreddit but like I said this was more for me than anyone else. Edit: I just found out that you cant post directly to your profile so I guess Ill post it here. ","1"
"hi there.    I have been battling depression for around 5 years now.  a couple of attempts on my life but they didn't work.  i am glad they didnt now.  I have made certain changes to my life now ( getting my own home, getting divorced) cutting all the hangers on and so called mates from my life.  Ditching most of social media.  I was lucky to have a few friends who understand and had my back, we all have depression so its more like a shoulder we can all lean on  ( we call ourselves team falcon punch)  and it seems that although this should have sent me crashing into despair, that these were the things that were causing my depression.l  I am currently SSRI free for a month now.  I guess what i mean to say isno matter how dark it seems,  keep on pushing.  find that thing that keeps you going.  ( for me it was music)  particularly SIXX:AM and Forever Still.

"Hi everyone. I've never posted here before but I do linger and comment from time to time... Anyways tp get to the point I guess what this is, this post, is a way of letting things out. I've been holding things in that are to difficult to talk about, even with my husband. So I guess here I go.My entire life I have struggled with anxiety depression, self harm, suicide, ECT.. For the past year and a half I have had it under control at least until about 2 weeks ago. My family to me that they were moving, far way, to a place I will leave un-named. In that I found out that they had lost custody of my sister and brother. I have never been far away from my parents. Even when i was in hospitals and residentials I was still a 15 minute drive away from home. And even now after being married and living on my own I has still been close to my family. Because even in my own place with my own family, my parents house was always home to me. And I'm heart broken. I miss my family so much. I know this isn't a big deal to a lot of people but for me right now its difficult and I wanna cry all the time and it just sucks. And today I thought about suicide of the first time in a year. Not for any particular reason just that I have been so overwhelmed between my life and work. And frankly I just want to be able to take a break from being an adult and dealing with life.Anyways I guess I just needed to get that off my chest. Sorry for the long post. And thank you for reading to the end.","1"
"So the last times ive been drunk ive been told by my boyfriend that i start to reproach him on everything i feel he has done that u think is bad or no up to my ideals of him, the thing is i see on social media all my friends and their boyfriends so happy & they do romantic stuff for them and so & i feel bad because he doesnt do any of that and i feel like im not worthy, and i end up crying like crazy and telling him why doesnt he love me and such, i mean he works at nights and i only see him once a week and most of that day hes asleep and i want him to be with me but he also wants to go to the gym and things he has to do and i feel bad because i think he doesnt want to spend time with me or that he just doesnt care and it frustrates him, today he told me that i should not drink anymore and that he doesnt want to drink with me ever, because i get so bad lately, las weekend i hit myself multiple times on the wall & busted my lips open and i dont even remember why and i only remember feeling overwhelmed and that he needed to comfort me but he was super mad and was telling me to go home and for me that meant i was being pushed over that he didnt care for me and that i was a burden for him and made me feel even worse, the thing is, i dont work/study i do nothing all say but think, i know im extremely depressed because all i do is cry about anything, and i feel im worthless, that i cant do anything right & i dont even try because i dont feel im good to get a job or something, my mother always tells me i dont do shit, that i dont want to do anything but for me i just feels she doesnt support me, i have a much younger brother and she lives with him and his father, & ive lived with my grandma for most of my life and i always felt she pushed me aside and be like youre an adult now go your thing by yourself and leave me alone, and well im alone, i feel everybody looks at me and thinks im just this worthless person that doesnt wanna do anything but drink & do crazy shit, but i do want to become a better person but i cant seem to get a way out, i feel like im trapped into this rutine of doing nothing and pretending im ok because everytime i try to tell someone that i feel like im really depressed and on the edge they just tell me get over it and go do something and brush me off, agh i hate this, i feel like im blowing things with my boyfriend, i love him to pieces and i try to understand him but im hurting so much on the inside that all i do is fuck things up with him, not trusting him, wanting to know everything he does at all times, telling him hes not romantic enough, or that he doesnt care & i know im the one thats being selfish , he recently bought a cellphone and i told him he blew the money for my gift that i was hoping to get on our anniversary and he got mad and told me he never buys anything for himself, that he always buys food for us or something to drink and bla bla and that he needs stuff to, and gosh i do understand but then my insecurities kick in and i began to think he just doesnt care and we got into a fight and he told me everything i told him last weekend when i was drunk and that he needs stuff and that im being selfish and then told me to try and look for a school to study what i want and well im on that track of doing everything i can to make it happen because i really wish that if im working and stuff it helps with my depression by me putting all my energy on something else, so you think i can do that? Do you think if i get into college again & get my shit together ill be better? Do you think this depression is for the fact that ive plenty of time to myself and im just overwhelmed by doing nothing?    Sorry for the huge rant! I needed it :/","1"

"I feel like Im at the point where I just dont want this life anymore. Im not going to act on that, I have responsibilities that cant be left, but Im just at my breaking point.

I finally found the exact job Ive wanted since I moved a few years ago, was so happy thinking this was exactly what I needed to turn things around. 6 months later clearly that is not what has happened, this is a great job, but Im still extremely unhappy with it. Dont have any friends there but also just the job, something Ive grown up loving and always wanted to continue doing brings me no happiness. In fact nothing does, I have lost interest in everything I used to love. Except food. Damn food. I Used to be huge, from August 2016 to July 2017 I lost 100lbs, since then Ive completely stalled, whats the point when food is the only thing to bring me some comfort even though it also brings extreme guilt. I Still have 60lbs to go but just cant. Part of me wants a relationship, Ive tried online dating, have had quite a few seem interested but when its time to meet I just panic and completely shut down, Im so disgusted with my body, there is no way anyone else could be okay with it or me... doesnt matter if I do get to my goal weight, get as fat as I did and your skin is screwed up. I Work eat and sleep, that is my life day and day again, it all just blurs together at this point. I Cant think of a situation where Id ever be happy, I just dont want this life anymore, as I said I wont act on that... but Im just so tired.

"Recently, my friend has been having problems with her family and she hasn't been talking to anyone. I attempted to ask if she would like to talk about what is going on and she refused to talk to me, and just walked away. She has been like this for a couple weeks now and I am just absolutely worried about her. I have tried my best in making her happy by texting her everyday and saying how much I love and care for her, I bought her her favorite candy, I made a mood jar and a motivational jar (a jar full of happy and joyful quotes and jokes) and tried to tell her in person again how much she means to me, but she still is sad. I understand that a few gifts won't cure her depression but I just care about her so much that it hurts me when I see her so gloomy 24/7. It has gotten to the point where she isn't even texting back anymore and doesn't show up in our usual spot at school. I am determined to keep pushing and tell her how much she means to me and how much she means to everyone but at the same time people are telling me to give her space. I am at a loss. If anyone can help me out in this situation, it would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.","1"

With that, with full honesty, I must say that the odds of myself being able to return any form of help to you is minimal. But, I have strong hopes of paying it forward in some form or another for strangers.     Howdy,  I am currently at terms with the idea that I do not know how to help myself. That, although I've never categorized myself as someone with depression, I have some problems that need addressing. First of all, unlocking my potential. Shit, I know that I am much better than what I am putting out. Every day I remind myself of my daily activities: running, eating healthy (sometimes simply eating), communicating with friends, and homework. Despite that I know what I must do, most days I end up with Netflix on watching some silly sitcom that in no way furthers me in life.  I believe part of me is stuck in a relationship that ended and I feel the sense of guilt of moving forward. That, although I have been played wrong in the past, I still hold my alliance to a lost lover. That allowing myself to move forward is a sign that I am a liar, a hypocrite, for all the times I told her that I loved her, that I always would, and so forth. The mere idea of pursuing another intimately is a put-off. In fact, making friends has become a struggle. With my goals always in mind, I never achieve them. I've become cocooned in self-doubt that I can't pick out many qualities of my own that I like and what to thrive in.  Last, that my hobbies have been reduced to a pea-size amount. Rarely does something feel worth my time. This narcissistic idea that I have to achieve greatness in my time though some means is crippling. Though I know unlikely, the idea of being 24 years of age with nothing to show for it fortifies my cocoon.     Where do I stand today? Fuck it, I'll stay real, I've never been one to say a day is good or bad, but I am taken over with this desire to write and it feels good. I want to know what others, although I am scared as shit of this kind of vulnerability, what others think for me. What steps can I take to help myself.        Thank you,  Nathafafin.","1"

"Hello there, I have never been to a psychologist so when I have a problem I try to self diagnosis myself and search online. This might be or nor the case but I might be suffering from anhedonia. I thought it would be nice to talk about general topics from time to time.Anhedonia is unable to feel pleasure due to being under stress circumstances. If you have this, you might not be enjoying life as much as you used to.I've read that doing physical exercises like running causes a bundle of hormones to be secreted thus it makes you feel better. I interpreted this as it stimulates you ,then you response to this stimuli as your circumstances changed just like extroverts need to be stimulated.I can't talk much so if anyone wants to share their knowledge, they are welcomed.","1"

"Today's my 18th birthday today and I've never felt so sad in my entire life. It's hard for me to even move my fingers to type this. I'm not sure why I feel this way and I was hoping someone could help me out. Male btw.I'm going to try and describe my life and what I think could be the problem right now. Ill go in chronological order. Ive always been a very emotional person and stimulus has had profound effects on me mental health. This summer I tried weed for the first time and have been using it about once a week since. It has never made cry or sad before though. I dont know if that is contributing to my feelings at all or maybe I feel guilty for telling my parents I don't use it. Ok so next I have always been very unmotivated in school to the point where I don't care if I get bad grades. My parents do care though. This creates obvious problems but the one that stands out to me is they take my electronics when I get bad grades. Usually this would piss me off and I'm sure I used to be addicted to gaming but now I would rather be social. Me being more social has lead me to meet new people and new friends. About a week ago I started having very intense feelings for a girl that I have never had in my life before. Recently though,being last weekend,we went to an airport overlook on saturday and talked to each other for a long time and  we told each other that we liked each other the next day, which was sunday. It was very cold at the airport and I might have gotten sick because of it. I had a very slight fever of 99.2 and just felt bad in general but there is a cold running around with the people I know so it might of just been from that. Alright guys this is where  it gets serious. Sunday I had to go to a dinner with my mother and brother somewhere 45 minutes away because irrelevant reasons, what was relevant though is that for the first time in a while I just felt these crashing waves of depression and anxiety hit me like a train. I got so sad i had to leave the restraunt for a moment and cry my eyes outside this is when I realized i was very depressed but wasnt sure why exactly. I think it might have something to do with my girlfriend because I feel infatuated by her and not being with her sucks? That shouldnt give me depression though? Alright next day. It was monday so i had school i kind of felt like crying jn my first period but i was ok. I made plans to hang out with my gf so I went to her house because her parents didnt want her leaving the house. I was a handholding virgin still but I ended having my first kiss last night. My girlfriend is such a wonderful and amazing person and she deals with depression too, but while we were hanging out, after the kiss, I just felt lethargic and sad and didn't really want to be there anymore but I did want to be there at the same time. I gave her a hug and drove home. That night I was crying while doing my homework I wasn't exactly sure why again. So I went to bed and boom my birthday. Today. I went to school and got through 1st block but I got so sad and irritated in 2nd that I just went to the nurse and drove home. I've never left school early because of depression before. I got home and told me my mom she needed to come home so she left work and came to see me and I felt out of It the whole time having bad short term memory and crying. She wanted to schedule a meeting with a doctor but he's not there. We were going to go to walk in a psych place but I said I wanted to take a nap. The reason I said that was  because I was worried they would drug test me or something and I feel like that would make everything worse if my parents knew I smoked because I tell them all the time I never do drugs and I don't want to burden them anymore. My girlfriend says she would let me try some of her anti depressants if I wanted after school. I told my mom and she doesn't want me to do that but I don't think in can wait any longer. I'll try to sum it all up. I think a reaskn I'm depressed because I like my girlfriend so much and have never felt this way before about anyone. But why am I sad when I'm with her??? I want to try meds me and her talked for along time about it and i would give anything to stop crying because of something I don't understand right now. My friends... I don't know what to do. Should I try my gfs meds she has 3 and they are called  Prozac Wellburtin and Zoloft. Should I go to a psych ward and get prescribed stuff??? Fuck. I think I might be crazy, I just want to hear what someone else thinks about this.... if you need more details let me know.TLDR: can u read the whole thing pls... if not I guess I'm asking if having a gf is my cause of major depression..........","1"

"So one of my good friends (""Josh"") has struggled with depression for a while. Last year he was at a crisis center for about a week, and his depression is getting pretty bad again. His best friend (who I'm also friends with) talked to him a little over a week ago and it seems like ""Josh"" has been going back and forth on kind of admitting he's depressed and outright denying it. I was going to talk to him last Wednesday, but he's been ignoring me since last Monday. His best friend, another friend (he's a youth pastor), and I are going to sit ""Josh"" down and talk to him to see where he's at and if we can convince him to get help. How do we talk about it and/or bring it up?","1"

"Im 15, and in year 9. Ive had problems with depression and anxiety for a year or so now. It went away for a while, but it comes back now and again. The problem Im having now is, I dont want to go to school, not because Im getting bullied or anything like that. Its because of exams and the pressure. Im finding it hard to deal with the pressure put on me, to do well and perform well in my subjects. I just feel like theres no where to go. There are alternative schools and such, but they dont suit my needs. Im just looking for some answers and ways to deal with this. Thanks. ","1"

"I am about to hit it. My beloved grandmother has been diagnosed with cancer and its seems with each test shes on terminal stage. I cant even realize this and only burst to tears once in a while when I understand that its not likely shell get chemo. Meaning she will have to go under surgery meaning she might die right on the table. It happened too early. Its the first time in my life that I was feeling alive since I was a teen and she was so happy for me. For the first time in my life my family felt balanced and positive. The first time I wanted to get married. The first time I feel really becoming myself, making decisions... and that she was so happy for me... And for the first time I realized I want to have kids some day with my boyfriend who changed my life. What happened now? Maybe I just didnt believe shed die that soon. Maybe I didnt expect it would be cancer. Maybe... I dont know. It feels like Im rejecting it. My boyfriend tried to calm me down and share his experience and all I felt was anger. He was talking softly to me, telling that I must be near her, that I shall help her, that I shall confess her that I know that shes sick and be closer to my mom too... and I just wanted him to leave me alone, while he was making me tea and so on. He said that Im not alone - but I wanted to be alone at that moment most of all. I wouldnt let him caress my hair trying to calm me down. He tried to tell me I was doing the right thing that I wanted to come to her place and confess that I know shes sick even shes trying to protect me because its not my turn to protect er and so on. He tried to share his experience when his dad had cancer trying to be emotionally close. What I did? I told him that shouldnt he stop nagging me and shut up, Id just explode with anger. -but I didnt nag you -what in the world is not clear to you when I say that I get hit by realization the last? -ok, ok,-said he and quietly sat aside while I was feeling all this none sense anger at himI cant even hear myself behind the guilt that all I feel is childish pain, deep and primitive, not all that complex adult stuff? I cant even hear myself.And hes still sitting next to me, guarding me like Holy Spirit. I feel so guilty that all I want now is just to be alone for a while, that Im angry at myself for being so emotionally retarded and catching uncontrollable crying every time I think what kind of bitch I am that I have been far away from her so long even I love her and she loved me. What kind of bitch I am to get angry at someone delicately trying to help. That I.. god, it feels like all I want to do is make others suffer. I push away anyone whos near. I dont feel togetherness with anyone. I dont want anyone to share my pain with. I dont need it and I dont want it.I feel so numb dumb and pathetic. I cant stand myself. Every time people tell me I can be myself I become this...Ps sorry for mistakes, English is not my native languageEdited some details I didnt mention not to look as bitchy as I really am. So yes, I basically told a guy who tried to share his dads cancer story to just shut up. Im not even sure if I really feel guilty or posing. I cant stand myself.","1"

"Around a year and a half ago to two years ago I just didnt feel like the same person i use to be. I became quiet in school (as i am a sophomore in highschool) I lost interest in my favorite sport to play which is ice hockey as well as hanging out with friends. I feel like i have a constant voice in my head criticizing me and telling me to kill myself and that no one likes me. Im so scared to tell anyone, including my parents because i dont want them to have to go through emotional trauma knowing their son is going through this. Im so nervous of someone finding out i made a new reddit account because of my cousin knowing my other one. I dont know what to do anymore to help myself. I find myself smoking weed and drinking everyday now to escape the pain when i dont even want to. I tried to tell my friends about all of this but they just made fun of me because they thought i was joking. I dont want to die or hurt myself but i feel like im getting to a point where i cant stop myself. Ive been told to get over it and been told to just make friends and enjoy life. But when it comes down to it i feel like i cant even make friends. I hate my personality when im happy or sad.On the first day of school my english teacher asked us to write down words that we think describe our personality. The only words i could think of were Blank,Tired,Stupid,Worthless,and Hopeless .when im happy i talk to much and im just a nuisance to everyone. And when im in my normal hopeless state of mind im just quiet and awkward. I need help and advice for what i can do. Im just hopeless on my own. i wanted to try to talk to my social worker at my school but while in her office i just walked out knowing she would tell my parents if i talked to her about it. I cant tell anyone. I cant do anything but keep it in. I can barely even go to school anymore without feeling out of place with the feeling of tears coming on in the back of my eyes. Please what can i do to help myself. I dont want to die.sorry for this horribly structured paragraph as i typed this on my phone in a rush.","1"
"okay so im 14 and im in grade 9. MY generation is pretty fucked. Partys started in grade 8 everyone started drinking and smoking weed and i got dragged into all of it too. It was my choice because when i was little i wanted to be that party girl and have fun sneak out do drugs be a teenager whatever. And i want to be innocent again but i cant imagine myself doing that because i go out every weekend and if i dont i feel bored or like im missing out. Like partying is fun and i do it a lot but i kind of wish i never started and stayed a weird loser but then i would hate that. I know people that read this will be like wtf why is she doing all of this its so wrong but its considered normal in this generation. anyways i still have a lot to say. Something upsetting happened i was at a halloween party last week and its a thing for grade 9s like everyone in grade 9 has to go its a tradition type of thing and all u do is get drunk before show up in slutty costumes and hook up (not sex its making out thats what we call it). some girls hu with like 40 guys or more idk and i hu 20 times and my friend hu 25. and i posted a pic from the night with my friends. and these grade 10s at my school that are really popular started slut shaming me on my post and being so mean and made me cry for so long it was so unnecessary cuz 1. they did the exact same thing and 2. they are all huge sluts and have probably fucked half the school and it was just hate crime and im too scared to tell the school cuz other grade 10s will hate on me too not like half of the grade 10s dont hate me already for no reason i dont need more hate. they r also intimidating in the halls and honestly theyre probs all just jealous cuz theyre all ugly. but anyway they r a problem. another one is that half my grade are all in relationships and i rlly want a boyfriend too cuz everyone around me has one. but most guys expect like more than hooking up and i have been farther but never sober and i havent fucked but they want to and im just rlly scared. Im so nervous if they won't like my body or if i don't do something right also i get huge anxiety if im alone with a guy because i dont know what to talk about and i dont want awkward silence so PLEASE name ways on how to be not awkward with guys. My parents are also so unreasonable today at dinner i couldnt eat the steak because  i want to be FUCKING VEGETERIAN and my dad doesnt fucking understand i feel so bad when i eat red meat and since he makes money and hes the man of the house he thinks hes opinions are right. he calls me stupid for wanting to be vegeterian he thinks hes always right. if i dont like a food im automatically dumb cuz he likes it and hes the smartest person on earth. honestly i would be 100x better off without him my whole family would all he does is just yell at us. he took my phone away and grounded me just for not eating the fucking meat that makes me sick. he doesnt know the depression he costs me i already have school, friend drama, popularity, social life and all my little flaws that i cant let go of or how worthless i am and not good enough. im desperatly failing school also everything is so hard and i feel so alone i can't really talk to my friends without my phone and they are the only people that support me. ive told my mom abt how depressed ive felt before but she doesnt get it she literally just bought me shit and thought that i would be happy. i hate my body my butt isnt big enough nor  are my boobs i have such bad dark circles and so much acne god by is being a teen so fucking hard how can it get better cuz cutting is only making me weaker:(","1"

"I'm 31, have my own semi successful business, and have friends and family that love me and I'm thankful. But I feel so lonely constantly. When I was much younger I was diagnosed with depression and given medication to help. I've had an incredible psychiatrist most of my life who I owe my life to, literally. Yet I still feel so broken. I've never had a boyfriend. People tell me all the time how beautiful I am, how funny I am, how much fun I am to be around. I don't believe them. How can I be this age and have actively sought out a partner for so long but never had one? I am always the hot girls funny fat friend. It's so painful. There have been men that have befriended me strictly so I could ""set them up"" with a friend of mine. I've had men message me ""you'd be hot if you weren't fat."" Food is my way of self medicating and as much as I try to change my habits it's a struggle. My friends are incredibly insensitive and tell me since I'm overweight why do I bother talking to men that aren't? Why don't I just lose weight? Have I considered  lowering my standards? They think they're bring helpful. ""Protecting"" me. I wonder if it ever occurs to them how painful that is to hear them say these things. I can't even bring myself to tell them it's too hard. I know they have their best intentions but they're losing me. I'd rather stay in bed all day everyday than face my reality. I just want to have someone. Someone to hold my hand and tell me I'm theirs. To brag about me to their friends. To support me and encourage me. To be proud of me. I'm the only person I've ever been able to rely on and I'm so broken from so much disappointment and rejection. When I was little I imagined I would have a husband and a family some day. Now I'm 31 and haven't ever been on a date or done anything further than kiss someone. I feel pathetic and worthless. That it's time to just accept I'm damaged and no one wants to deal with that.I want to feel differently, but how can I?","1"

"The sad reality that I fail to comprehend in my head is that I fucked up no matter what happens with her she'll always be someone else's she'll never be mine once again for one simple reason. I fucked up and there is no turning back the sands of time. So why do I cling on this fantasy of mine... cuz I know that if I don't it would inevitable kill me and it will be a miserable pill to swallow but I know that it must be swallowed it or I will become hinged on an ideal that is no longer within my grasp. Regardless of which ever pill I decide to swallow I know that it will be full of pain and misery but it must be swallowed. Alas I'll be consumed by my burning desire. I know that it is creepy thinking about a girl this way but it is the only way I can deal with it at the moment. For it is within my nature to urn for something I don't have rather then be great full for what I do have. And once again I hover in circles within my mind spinning at the thought of that girl who for what ever reason had the strength and stamina to remain by my side for those few months while my mind was devoured by depression...

"(I'm going to try and summarise this so you all don't get bored with the details)Okay, so January 2016, I moved from Wellington, New Zealand, to Sydney, Australia. I was really sad about this because of all my friends at school, especially one friend who I still talk to regularly, and I've told her a bit about my depression (she also came to Sydney in June last year, which was amazing, I need to visit her soon).After around a month of living in Sydney, I got accepted into a school and started going there. I became friends with someone who turned out to be a bitch, and I became friends with her ""enemies"", so to speak, who she'd said had bullied her (turns out she was the bully, not them). Anyway, I became really good friends with them, and they've helped me so much with my depression/anxiety/cutting. I grew incredibly close to them, but there were the popular kids who often made me feel like shit (some of them have turned out to be not as bad as I thought they were, and they're actually okay), and my parents stressed me out SO, SO much with their expectations for my grades (anything below 80% is not amazing for them, and they will get annoyed if I get anything below that, which is every time, I'm a less than average student and they were topping every. single. fucking. class, and I can't live up to their expectations. Also, they're incredibly overprotective, they yell at me if I do THE SLIGHTEST thing that they don't like (that includes playing a game for a few minutes on my laptop when I'm supposed to be studying, and if I forget to do my homework, it's like the world is over) and my dad has slapped me a few times and punched me once. When my parents found out that I was depressed and cutting (at the beginning of this year), they took me out of the school that I was in. I didn't want to leave, because even though I knew I was bad, I knew that I'd be worse without my friends (and I was right, I'm way worse in the school that I'm in, I can't even be bothered to do anything about my depression anymore). I can't trust anyone in this school, everyone knows me as quiet but happy (the quietness may also be because of my (social) anxiety). I keep on relapsing, every time I tell myself I won't cut anymore, I end up doing it again, I cut today, and it felt great, but in hindsight, I wish I hadn't done it. And now, to top it all off, I've started not giving a fuck about school (or anything, really, for that matter - and I have important exams coming up and I can't see the point in studying for them, which I know is bad, but I can't make myself study, no matter how much I try). I mean, I was always a less than average student, but at least I tried to get good marks in exams and good report cards, etc. but now I can't be fucked. I want to go to TAFE at the end of this year SO BADLY, I know I won't be able to deal with Year 11 and 12. My parents don't want me to go to TAFE, because they say that since I don't know what I want to do, it's a waste of money on me. But then again, school is a waste of money too. And at least I'll try in TAFE, and I'm pretty sure it will help me. I like drawing (and I'm not too bad at it, if I do say so myself), I like reading (and sometimes writing, I might even consider a course in beauty or something (which will be yet ANOTHER disappointment to my parents, but honestly, I'd rather do something that I love and not earn as much than earn more and not be happy).Anyway, I'll finish here, I've rambled even though I told myself I wouldn't, oh well. I know you might just tell me that I'm an ungrateful asshole (you're probably right, too), but I honestly don't know what the hell to do. I've tried and tried and tried and nothing seems to work, so I guess this is a little vent. I'd really appreciate it if anyone could help in any way, because I'm honestly done. Thanks,Samara","1"
"So, first of all, hello everyone. Im a bit new to this sub.I recently came across a video on Psych2Gos YouTube channel about high functioning depression. Ive seen the video in my suggested feed for a while now and never really thought much of it. So I watched it and I took from the video that its okay to feel/be depressed and also be able to pass for a happy normal person.About that normal thing. Im on the spectrum, most likely Aspergers. When I was eight, my teachers thought I had Autism and I was tested. The tests said that I dont meet the criteria for a diagnosis, however, I reached the Low field (or whatever its called) on the criteria (this being under the old DSM IV system). I took some tests online (reliable, I know) and they all resulted positive. Ive already come to terms with this.Ive approached my parents about the issue, but I seems to me that they also think Im on the spectrum, but they think they can and want to separate the syndrome and myself/my way of living. Since Aspergers/Autism is a developmental disorder, you cant really do that. Its one of the reasons why people on the spectrum dont want a cure if one were found.In any case, back to the depression part. I looked up high functioning depression a bit more and found dysthymia, the diagnostic term for the condition. I could spend my time in this post talking about how I think I have the condition, but Id rather not waste time on that. Instead, lets talk about today.I play in my unis pep band. We had to play two sets today, one at the event for prospective students and one at a volleyball game. I ate breakfast at around 7am and then left for the events. Didnt find time to eat. The game ended at around 2:00pm. I eventually got food, but when I got home, I basically just laid on my bed doing nothing because I was very tired and worn out (burnout would be the Autism word for this).I end up sleeping for some length of time that I am still not aware of. This, in turn, messes up my body cycles and all that crap because science. Anyways, I end up not really eating much. My dad asks me one time if I wanted food and I answer yes, but he doesnt say anything back. Later, in a conversation with my mom and I, my dad recalls the situation as I asked him if he wanted food, but he didnt answer. I correct him with the details above. He later comes into my room (actually this was a few minutes ago) and tells me not to throw him under the bus like that again. He tells me that he gets angry with me because it takes forever to get me to do anything (when in reality I simply dont know what I want to do with my day because Im so indecisive).Between his pauses, I was just thinking about tell him about me possibly having depression. I feel like its so stigmatized that they would react the same way they did to my concerns with Aspergers. I recall my mom reading a post that I shared on Facebook talking about how people are rude in terms of dealing with food allergies at restaurants. It mentions something about depression, apparently. I can recall my mom talking about it, reading that small thing about depression and thinking oh, I was worried whosician was depressed. In reality, I probably was, but that wasnt the point of me sharing the post (as I myself am allergic to mushrooms).I feel like my parents, if not ignore, then simply make things worse for me. I honestly dont know what to do. If you recommend therapy, the college Im transferring to in the fall has a good therapy program that is confidential (and included in tuition) that I will look into getting into when I get there.","1"

I've recently put together a few pieces of my life and realized that due to years of living in a negative family household (father has some fucked up psychological problems and his behavior is either passive, violent, or depressive), having lost my two best friends in my teenage years - my mother and maternal grandmother, and some other complexes, I've developed a masochistic psyche. I think it stems from being treated like shit by my father throughout the years while at the same time somehow being expected to be a firm pillar of the family (I also have a young sister).So, what do you guys think is the best way to resolve this? As I said, on the surface I'm confident, and have no social anxiety or problem talking to anyone including women, but deep down it sometimes feels like the captain has left the ship, if you know what I mean.I'm a male in my very early twenties, by the way.","1"
"So writing this because i'm not sure how to keep carrying on. feeling like it shouldn't go on anymore.let my family be sad for short time and move on. sad to say that.I want to live, but if this is all. what is the point. Leaving out some Gruesome Details that haunt me everyday. Now that I have been alone for so long. My ill mind has made me think that what I am doing is rational. Terrifying me with demons and a extreme fear of the dark. Telling me there is something there and every now and then catch a glimpse the the ghouls with my perrifereals wishing I handing so I focus in on what I was doing acting like nothing happen or was there to terrified to look back. Even writing this. Making me shaky and I can never put this is words because they come at me more if I do.	Heavy depression and no goals or emotion to moving on started when i lost my last job.It was roughly 2 or 3 months ago. Although the Depression has been going on most my life. Started staying away from others and being a loner maybe 3 years ago. Cutting ties with friends(just felt i was dragging them down due my consistant lack of enthusiasm for anything) and living a near complete solitary lifestyle. So trying to get myself back into something to carry on ,but i sleep most the day. When i get up just feed my dog, watch youtube, and play a game. Don't leave the house unless its just go to to plasma clinic to get 20 dollars for food. And make that last as long as i can.      Anyone been in a rut like this and gotten out. Would like to hear. I don't want to call old friends to try to pull me out because its not their burden.Forgive me if i don't get back to immediately. I don't know reddit very well and don't stay focused easy.

"Hi there. Im 20 y.o., currently I live through one of the darkest times of my life. But I dont want to cry out and complain, telling you how hard it is for me to live, how I want to get rid of weight on my chest.I want change. Now, it doesnt bother me that Im alone, I completely fine with that. But I want to get a new hobby. The problem here is that I really dont know what I want to do. Seriously. I want to try to do new things, but at the same time I dont know  exactly what I want. I was making videos about pro-wrestling, and I was quite successful in that, as I have 100+k subscribers on YouTube. But I lost interest in wrestling, and now Im wondering whats next.The final thing that Id add is that I tried to rap. I did that to entertain myself, just for fun, so there was no purpose like money, success and all that stuff. I wrote just one verse and one hook and rapped in front of my friends. And guess what. All of them liked it. And it really confused me, one friend told me that I really-really should consider rapping further. And believe me, my friends are the first people that will tell me if Im doing something wrong. Actually, I am confused. I really enjoyed writing a rap track, but Im afraid to fail, and at the same time I need to get a new hobby. Please help me. Thanks","1"

"Hello redditors from r/depression,Im a law student who might be suffering from chronic depression (going to get checked in two days) and Ive been sitting in my depressive slumber for way too long.It started affecting my relationship, my studies, my family life, it takes over slowly but steadily, since its only chronic, not permanent depression.Now, I can hear you all in your heads:Why do you talk about it? The title said something different!Yes, it does say that Im working on a possible solution. I needed to tell you first what Ive been through so you can identify with the problem at hand.The solution Im working on is not scientific, Im not a doctor by any means, I just find the human mind and the humans in general fascinating, so as a hobby I read psychology books.Im trying to find help that could be accessible for everyone to try it.It consist on seeing if depression can be controlled and eventually defeated by learning about oneself.Let me explain:Ive been on r/depression_help one day, not as a poster but as a reader. I was about to post about my struggles but instead I started reading other peoples posts and decided I wanted to help at least one person. So I did. I tried to help u/DreadfulDancer (to which Ill refer to as patient from now onwards) because of her [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/78mrrl/i_16f_just_dont_even_know_what_im_feeling/), it made me happy to be able to help her (thats my nature after all) and when she responded positively, I was overjoyed that my method worked for her. This got me thinking: is it a one-shot or is this method something that can be reused and successful.The method consisted of giving the patient tools for learning more about themselves and how they function as a human being. I hinted at [www.16personalities.com](www.16personalities.com) and suggested to the patient to take the test and analyse their results, leading the patient to a self-discovery and prompting some sort of a third-person view on their problem.Here comes my question for you:Could you all post your stories here in the comments? I only need the story of how you discovered you were/are suffering from depression.I encourage you to take the same test the patient did and answer your own comment with how it helped you see your depression from a different angle, if it did anyway.Thank you to all who made it so far and once I finish writing my document, ill make sure it gets to all the people whod be interested in giving it a read.Tl;dr: give me your depression stories and take the personality test (link in the post) and tell me how it helped you if it did.(To u/DreadfulDancer: sorry to post you your name twice but im trying to reach out to as many people as possible)","1"
"Hi everyone, Im new here and am looking for advice in regards to my brother, who I very much believe is suffering from a form of depression.My brother is 27y/o and is a pretty heavy drug user, has smoked pot/drank since he was 13ish. He has always been viewed as lazy unmotivated etc., but my parents have always believed he was just a teenage boy and would grow out of it. In his early 20s he got 2 DUIs and has been struggling to get back on his feet since. He has been living with my parents for the last 5ish years as he can not afford to live on his own. My parents are by no means perfect (I mean, what parents are?!) but theyre good parents. They do everything they can for him. But their relationship with my brother struggles, they fight often, and about every 6 months my brother moves out/gets kicked out, disappears for a few months, then comes home when he hits rock bottom to try to work it out with them and get his life back on track again. Ive been telling them for years that I believe he needs to see a doctor and get his mental health in check. My parents went to go see a family counselor finally, and are wanting to look into ways they can help him. They have been trying to reach him and he will not respond to him. This last year, even 6 months he has gone very down hill. I suggested that they look for a new family counselor because they left from their first session pretty upset because they were told it was likely because they didnt hug/love my brother enough when he was a baby. Just felt that was unethical, whether or not its the case (not likely). So while they search other options Im trying to find ways to convince my brother to go. tl;dr Looking for good ways my parents and I can approach my brother in convincing him to get professional mental help","1"
"I fucked up. I fucked everything up. I haven't been feeling well (bad headaches, constantly tired) and my depression has just been awful. I stopped going to class for a week and I was able to go a  few days ago, but then it started again. The only reason why I go to work is because I ran out of call-offs. My apartment is a huge mess because I'm so busy all the time and when I do have time off I just want to sleep.I have nobody to talk to because my family is shitty, the health center hasn't called me back about making an appointment, my friends are starting to distance themselves from me (I don't blame them, I tend to push people away when I get like this), and I feel too embarrassed to speak to my professors about it.I got a shitty text from my friend not long ago and ever since I've just been sitting in my room crying. I think everything has just built up and that was just the last straw. I'm probably going to fail my classes (which sucks, because I'm so close to graduating) and I just want to be done already! I can't just withdraw from the classes either, because I didn't realize until it was too late that I missed the deadline. I've barely been able to eat too. Not because I don't have the energy, but because I have no money.

"I've had some issues for a long time. Throughout my last few years in school I had people who I considered good friends but I somehow felt alone. I don't want to call it depression but I have a lingering feeling that I'm not good enough for anything and that I don't deserve the friendship I've been given. 2 months ago I started Uni and with only one really good friend joining me from my past life I thought I could turn over a new leaf, put my problems behind me. But 7 weeks in, on a night out in town with 3 of my closest friends I made so far I broke down. The sensation that I don't deserve their friendship, that I don't deserve the love of others hit me while I was being 'wing-manned' by my mate. I got angry, lashed out at them and now I feel worse. If this is how I treat my friends maybe I don't deserve any. They didn't want to hurt me, they just wanted me to pull.

"I live in a boarding house, in a 12x12 room and I dont know. I think my neighbors dog has fleas, maybe?I keep my dog on trifexis and Ive never had a problem with fleas for the many years Ive owned him.  And I cant use any other medication as long as hes on trifexis. But its been 2 months of constant itching and fleas, and Im so overwhelmed. I bathe him, used sprays, sprayed the room, bombed the room, and everything works for a day.  And even its back in full force. The thing Im supposed to do is vacuum every day (even though I have wood floor). But my stuff isnt messy per se, but stacked against all the walls where fleas like to hide I guess.I dont have the strength to move everything, every day, for a month.  I can barely get out of bed. I vacuumed once and it was just a massive ordeal, and even then I couldnt get a lot of spaces. I dont even have that much stuff, its just a small room and I dont have a lot of space to maneuver. Just, everything Ive read says that vacuuming every day is the only way to get rid of them and I just feel cursed and miserable. Im tired, and Im sure my dog is miserable. I just dont know.

"i would consider myself a very fiery and motivated person and i would stay up really late painting but sometimes for like a week or two i would just get miserable and sad and cry a lot and i had a really negative mindset. and i just wanted to be alone for no reason. i just kind of dealt with it and blamed it on being ambiverted or something and took a few days off from my friends. about a month ago i started feeling really just tired and introverted. then something happened that basically made me feel like really bad about myself but the other person didnt do anything wrong. that made it a lot worse and i felt so horrible. i thought it would just go away in a week like usual but it didnt and it just got worse and worse. i kept thinking bad things about everything like i couldnt think of anything good. i tried to list the things i liked about my best friend and why i wanted to be her friend but i could only list the things about why i thought she was annoying and horrible and a bunch of bad things. i couldnt think of anything good out of anything in my life or myself and i ended up pushing my closest friends away. i wanted to be away from them because i didnt see anything good in them and i thought that it would be peaceful if i was alone. i didnt talk to them for weeks and ignored their texts and calls. yesterday i had a slightly better day so i decided to talk to my friends and apologize and tell them what was going on. my closer friend understood and for the most part forgave me. my other friend however got really really angry with me and called me selfish and a monster. i sometimes fought with him and usually i would get over it and we would be ok but it just got to me. i never felt so hopeless and sad and empty and lost in my life. i was so close to self harming and i wanted to so so badly but thankfully i reached out to an older friend i trust and she gave me good advice and i calmed down. after a couple hours i went to talk to my dad. he and i are  similar so i felt like he would understand more than my mom. i talked to him and told him what i was feeling and he said that he felt the same way, some weeks he would feel miserable and couldnt do anything, and some weeks he couldnt stop working. he dealt with the bad weeks better than me though. he said that if anything got bad that i should go talk to him. i'm still a teenager so i know everything can get out of whack but i dont want to feel this way anymore and none of my other friends have these swings. i dont know whats going on and why i get like this. sorry this was so long i just need to get my thoughts in order and maybe some answers. thanks.","1"

"Hi reddit community. My friend, 19, has been struggling with depression for about 5 years now. It started with him cutting ties with all his other friends,  changing schools and gradually dropping out of school. He stopped going out of the house much and spending more time on his PlayStation. He would spend days not interacting with anyone else in the house and just playing for long hours. He'd get angry if anyone confronted him about it. Over the years, his game time decreased and was swapped with watching player videos on YouTube. He barely steps out anymore, his sleep cycles are erratic, barely eats and has bare minimum interaction with anyone, including his family. The family has tried various therapists and psychologists but he wouldn't go himself. We don't know what to do. He doesn't talk about it, let alone acknowledge that there is a problem. If we try to talk about it, he gets angry or shuts himself out, sometimes even shuts himself in his room for days. We have no idea what's going on in his mind or how to help him. Has anyone been through a similar situation or seen someone in a similar situation? tl;dr- Friend struggling with depression for 5 years; doesn't step out of the house, bare minimum human interaction; doesn't acknowledge that there is a problem or talk about what's going on in his mind","1"

"Dont know where to post this question, but need your collective help for a college senior fighting through serious physical depression.

The depression surfaced just ~2-yrs ago, even though dads been gone since early teens.   The Ask:  Hes doing a retreat in affiliation with his college.  Im asked to write an affirmation-type letter to help him reflect, center and improve his spiritual and physical self.  He will read this in private while in the woods or something like that.

"I feel so empty. Hallow. Purposeless. I guess I have depression but I hate saying that, as it feels like I'm undermining the people who actually serious depression. -It's not too surprising, my mother and sister both have it, and I have anxiety. (My therapist says they go hand and hand) I hate getting up. I stay up late because it's the only time I actually get to myself. And then I sleep in. And then I'm upset at myself because the day is half over. -I'm very introverted. Most of my anxiety is social anxiety. Because of this, I don't go out and hang with people. I never understood how people could go out with friends and have a good time. Whenever I'm around a 'friend' I'm just uncomfortable, no matter what we're doing. I don't have friends, but I don't really mind that much. Like I said, I'm always uncomfortable with people so it's nice. But sometimes I get lonely. Really lonely. I wish I knew other people, other friends, maybe even a girlfriend or something, but I know deep inside that I actually don't want that. I'm always uncomfortable around everyone, I don't actually to be around more people. -I'm a computer animation student at Full Sail, through their online program. I get good grades, but I don't feel like I'm anywhere close. I graduate next year, and I feel so unprepared. I don't feel good enough to get a job in this.I like to draw and video edit but I hate calling myself an artist. It feels egotistical; I don't think I've created anything that should be considered art. It's so hard to do this now. The pen is heavy, I have no inspiration, I just feel like I'm getting nowhere. I almost wish I could give up on all this, it's just been too much lately. But I've spent literally my whole life devoted to this, and I would have nothing if I quit. -I hate talking about myself, maybe because no one listens. Whenever I talk about something/add something to a conversation, I always get the classic ""Yeah..."" while they're looking away. When I notice this, I just stop talking in the middle of a sentence, and no one notices. I hate feeling like this; empty and depressed. It makes to feel so ungrateful, my life is awesome! I have a family that loves me, a place to sleep, financial stability, great grades, it frustrates me that I can't be happy. -I always see those tweets where someone is like ""I love you, stay strong!"" or ""I will always be there for you!"" to all of their followers. Really? You care about me? One generic miserable person, who won't even reply to your tweet, because he knows that you won't bother responding to any of the thousands of responses? I like to follow artists with low followers because I have a crazy delusion that we maybe I could be their friend. I like to respond and comment on there stuff because they're the only ones who respond and make me feel noticed. I feel so manipulative and gross about it, especially when the artist is female because it makes me feel like some sort of creeper stalker. -I'm just looking anywhere for a connection of some sort, but nobody cares. And why should they? This is why I'm writing this. I don't know what this is, a cry for help, a rant, venting, a stupid post that will get buried. But I need to write this out. It has no place in my life, so I need to dump it all somewhere. That's one reason why I'm using a throwaway account, I don't want this connected to me in any way, I don't want people to know this. I know I'm ruining my life by staying inside, but at this point, I can't imagine the future being any better, so I figure I might as well do what makes me happy now. The other reason is because I don't want this to be seen an advertisement or a post to try and get pity points and sympathy. I don't want you to feel sorry for me. I just want to feel something. -Thanks for reading this, sorry it's so messy and disjointed. I'm going to bed right after posting this, so I won't be able to respond to any comments until I wake up.","1"
"Hi, I am (36)(F) and already have 2 kids at their 20 and 18 and been single mkm for 14 years. 4 years ago I fell in love with my partner (M)(42) and have given a baby now 10months. He have 4 kids also. So we are just a very big family. Two months ago, I find it odd, one day, I woke up I feel he is cheating on me and to my guts I discovered it a few days back. He admitted to his sin, to my family and his family. I am completely shattered with this since I am battling with my post partum blues and here goes another one. He ask for my forgiveness and a week away from us to find himself leaving me forcing me to stand and be okay to fend for our baby. Now, I tried to download the app in which I caught him by his sin, to found out he still has it in his phone. I confronted him about that. He said he will fix it and not even messaging the girl. I just don't know why he still have it or shall I believe and trust to the space he needed. I just don't know where and how to pick up myself. I feel garbage. I want to trash myself voluntarily. I tried sui ide so many times but even hell wouldn't keep me in. Sometimes I wanted to say can I just be selfish for myself not thinking about my kids. It's really painful tbat I want to dissolve now.","1"

"Hey everyone. I feel like such a failure right now. I live in Ireland am a 25 year old female and my life is pathetic...and I feel I am to blame. I have no motivation to do anything about it though, I am struggling to get out of the house and interact with people, I also have social anxiety. Just so you understand me better.I am extremely depressed at this point, it is so difficult because I took on a college course and I have hardly gone in, when I do go in nobody takes me serious cause I never turn up. I emailed the tutors weeks ago telling them I have been dealing with depression but am okay now, at that point I thought I would be once I just got a hold of myself...I ended up slipping back into a depressed state a few days later. I have now missed more classes and am humiliated at this point to contact them again and turn up, I feel like a joke. It is a school they are running not a hospital. The social aspect is crippling for me, I am finding it difficult to be around strangers in a store let alone making friends in college. I just want to hide away and not face people cause of what a failure I feel I am. I already told the student advisor at the beginning of the year to give me a chance to go to college this year again when I missed the last semester due to leaving an emotional abusive relationship after 6 years and told him I was doing better, I feel so guilty he really helped me to get into this year and I feel I have fucked it, and I have nobody to blame but myself. I did try to go to a student counselor for a few weeks, he told me all I seem to do is kill time, I talk about nothing relevant. I go to the gym at late hours and that is the reason I am being harassed. That I need to start going at normal hours and coming to college. He seemed to think this depression and social anxiety I have is all just a joke. I am beginning to think maybe I am just a joke and everyone should laugh at me. I have been on the same antidepressant celexa for 8 years now. I take 15 mg, I weaned myself down to 10 from 20 but after telling her my social issues, dr told me to go to 15. I am sick and tired of being dependent on an antidepressant, having no friends, and feeling like crap about myself. I feel trapped and don't see a way out of this. I just fuck up everything good and I was meant to add this girl for a group project a week and half ago but cause I stressed about it for over week and the project is due in 2 days, I feel like crap, my sister keeps saying add her. Nobody gets my pain shame embarrassment guilt anger towards myself for what a failure I feel. I can't do the simplest things without over thinking it to the point where it makes me feel I am going crazy. Maybe I need to change the antidepressant I don't know but my self worth, confidence everything is in the drain. I just feel like I need time out to sort myself out...but I don't know how","1"
"It's true, dear world. I haven't a clue. As to even what I'm doing here, there, any damn where. Everyday I wake up and I feel time wasted on me. My time, the universes time whatever. Hell, you're wasting your time reading this.That's the one thing I hate most is wasting time and well that's all I do...waste time. I'm so close....I had a vision just an hour ago while I tried to close my eyes and fall asleep, that I just got up got in my car and checked my self into a mental institution. That was a new thing. Most of the time I think about taking the bottle of pills I have in my vanity cabinet. Or, getting in a car wreck. Those are my two most thought of...well thoughts. There are several ways I think about dieing and one reason I have not committed it yet. Fear. I'm still afraid to die.I'm still afraid of the consequences I know that will happen by hurting the people I love.So I don't.But fuck I want too.It's a never ending ping pong kind of life I lead.On one side of the table, there is ""tedious bordum"" that's the kind of day where not a damn thing happens. Just wasted time, wasted effort of living.Then, on the other side is ""kick in the teeth"". That's the side my hope goes to get its ass kicked by disapointment...and she's a real bitch. I'm the ball of course.Each day I'm punted back and forth.You see for the last 7 years my whole world just gets beaten down every single fucking day. It's started before my dad decided to kick the bucket...or rather the bucket kicked him. Diagnosed with liver cancer and dead with in two months. The ball of bullshit was tearing on the mountain and that my dears is what sent it straight down. I have always been a tool in my family and to my friends. My job was ""to serve"" I've known that since I was 5. So I never knew what I wanted to be. But I knew I wanted motherhood. I wanted to be a mother so bad that I turned into a mother to my family unit and to my friends. They all come to me. When they are hurt, or hungry, tired, or broke. I hold them, feed them, clean them, advise...When daddy was sick I wanted to be strong...for my mother, for the world, but I broke. Drank too damn much.Then popped out, moved around and then landed back home. Then it was my turn, got sick...almost died. Even then though, it wasn't about me. Mom, Couldn't leave her like that. Had to stay alive. Then she got sick, brain aneurysm, moved to her and cared for her. Left it all behind. Dumped my boyfriend, found another, nursed the family. Then I got dumped. Mom was fine, no one needed me.moved again. Built my life all over, and then that damn crippling lonliness, the kind that makes you do stupid things...like leave a great job and a place that you love just for the other person. And I did. Hell, it comes to a head. There's almost too much to put down. All the pain. Still so much more.Still I had a dream. To be a mom...and everyday that passes...I'm forced to accept that I can't be a mother. I can't get pregnant...and they can't tell me why. I'm healthy, and apparently have plenty of eggs. But I don't ovulate normally. My husband isn't much support either. Never goes to the doctor with me, won't do a sperms analysis. So yeah...there's that.""Just leave"" Can't.No money. Spent almost 3 years looking for a fucking job and no one will give me a god damn chance. And if I have to go back to serving tables I swear I'll slit my wrists over the salad bar. I've thought about all the ways I could go.Gun to the head, pro - no take backs, con - husband is a felon he'll go straight to jail.Hanging, pro - little clean up, con - husbands mother went that way...leaving scars on others isn't my intention. Slitting wrist, pro - works when done right plus it's poetic, con - fucking hurts.Jumping, well that's just a big ol' con, too much time to think on the way down.So I have the three bottles of pills.I pick each one up, and stare at them.Then I put them down and close the cabinet door.I stare at the door.I open it and pick up each bottle again.I feel the sting of tears, but I don't cry.I put them back and close the door again.I do this over and over, sometimes for real sometimes just in my head. All day, everyday. No matter where I am, what I'm doing, or whom ever I am with. So now what?Because, I haven't a damn clue.","1"
"Hi all :) havnt been clinically diagnosed but I have been a completely different person from who I used to be for a couple years now... things are just getting worse and it's getting harder and harder to recognize myself. So here's what I feel... or, lack of feeling...also, a bit of me just venting:One of the biggest things: I have absolutely NO energy. NONE. I always feel drained, exhausted, always need to nap, just 0 energy. I have tried different sleeping schedules. Going through days with or without naps in the middle. Having a regular 7-8 hour sleep. Nope. I never wake up feeling refreshed. I'm in a constant state of fatigue and tired and shit. Today, I went to 4 hours of class, got home around 3 and slept until 8pm... I do this kind of thing often. I sleep A LOT. It's annoying and I hate sleeping the day away. ): no sleep schedule works, I just end up still being tired, wanting to sleep more. It's very hard to convince myself to get out of bed. I had to withdraw last semester because I had too many absences...Second of all, I used to be extremely outgoing ( I think I always did have a little social anxiety of some sort but I used to push through it... Ex. On the way to somewhere I knew I liked to go and had people I liked, I would start sweating terribly and had a huge urge to ask my grandfather to just take me home ) and actually naturally sociable (I know, it contradicts with the anxiety I feel, but it takes an entire other paragraph to explain that) It was really easy to make friends. Now, it's hard for me to start conversations, hard to make friends, hard to have a flow, never make plans or go through with plans and actually dread when people ask me to meet up. I havnt seen any of my old friends in a VERY long time. I've only seen one, and that's because I halfway live with her and her parents. I barely talk to them and I'm barely at the house. I avoid talking or hanging out with them too.. I do not speak out in class, some days I find that I won't say a word until I get home and say hi to my grandparents. And even then, I might not say much. This is a person who used to make friends so easily And have conversations so easily I would have to be isolated in the corner of a room. I used to laugh,genuinely laugh, and be funny ALL the time. People would always talk about how funny and goofy I was... not only did I forget how to make friends, I forgot how to laugh and be funny and have fun. I can barely remember the joy you feel when you can genuinely laugh at something you think is hilarious. I am only truly comfortable around one person; my boyfriend of a year and a half. This is the person I am the meanest to. I am almost always being mean to him. I hold grudges over things that he didn't really do wrong but made me feel insecure, just because of my own observations. I am always arguing, and almost always have a bad attitude when I talk to him. I don't know how he deals with me. The worst thing is he is quite possibly the purest human being on this planet and I treat him like shit most of the time.I have TERRIBLE self esteem and I have no motivation to do anything I want to do because I have no energy. I am indecisive about decisions in life partly because of my lack of self confidence. I find it hard to touch down with the ""now"" and get in touch with reality. Days go by and I've not lived them. Nothing seems to have matter or substance. Things I used to take joy in ( writing, playing piano, drawing, even games) peak no interest in me anymore 99% of the time. I feel like I have reverted to a blob ): I feel like I have no hobbies, no interest, no personality, no story, no defining features or qualities, no anything. I don't feel like a person. I used to be so optimistic and resilient and had a logical explanation for everything I always had a REALLY good head on my shoulders and it was a quality I took pride in. I don't know what happened. So, have you guys had success with depression meds? Which ones? What's it like?What about success with change of lifestyle? As in eating really healthy and working out, forcing yourself to take part I activities. I would do this, but have no energy or motivation to. ): Is it possible to take meds just to get out of this hole, get in a good headspace with a strong grip, and then wean off the depression meds? I always was convinced I could get out/ think myself out of any mental situation on my own. I think I was wrong. :( ","1"
"My friend suggested I come here for my depression. I am very lonely I have never had a girlfriend and its not about sex its about like emotional support and love and the other night it got so bad that I felt like taking a lot of pills or something else like that, And I can't go to my parents not because they dont care just because I feel like they just wouldn't understand, and I can't go to a therapist because I don't feel like some stranger can help me. I just don't know what to do. And my friend says if I try to handle this situation by myself I'll end up killing Myself. ","1"
"Using my throw away but not sure why. Im just at the point of life where I dont see a future for myself and I feel Im too damn old to be at this point.  Some points about me:Mid 30/ still living at home with my parents and have been for about 11 years now. Im overweight but dont have time to go to the gym right now because Im in school getting my bachelors. Which deciding to go back to school has put me in massive debt.  So Im stressing about that. I left a stable job at a stable company with good progression because I wasnt happy there. Took a job with a family friend for more money but it didnt last, so I took a job just to make ends meet making a lot less money.  I do kind of like what Im doing now and my team is good and my boss is awesome. But honestly I dont see a future there as I rarely have work to do and my boss seems to trust everyone but me. I have very low confidence when it comes to approaching women and talking to them. I dont know how to do that and severely fear the rejection. So I just dont know. Im now at the point in my life where Im like screw it. Im just going to be alone and have no idea what Im doing with myself. Ill just stay single and hopefully find a path for myself.TL:DR - I suck.

"Hello everyone. New to here and was just looking for some help. For around the past 6 years now I have been very depressed and have a extremely low self esteem. I use to always think I had friends through elementary and middle school. However recently I realized that everyone just used me and that they never wanted to actually sit down and have a conversation or just simply have me over. I have just realized my depression around a month ago and have been trying my best to just hide it and not tell anyone else what is going on. My sister was also depressed for a long time so I went to her but she was not able to help me so that is why I am here. Im not at a all a social person now all my friends around me however are living the life. Whenever I see them it always bring up my past thoughts and attempts of taking my life but recently I realized that would just hurt more people that it would help me. I have tried talking to girls that I like however when they are hitting on me and I clearly notice it my depression and self esteem just tell me Im not good enough and the worst of what would come from even trying to ask them for their number or ask them out. I guess all that Im trying to say is that I am looking for a way to get help through this and some how boost my self esteem and help me get through depression.Thank you all for reading. ","1"

I don't lash out and do stupid stuff, but I just get so annoyed and upset at everything in my life, my girlfriend tries to make me happy, and I am very grateful for that. She got me concert tickets for my birthday coming up. But I am not happy about it just grateful. I show no emotion and I made her cry. At school though I am failing one of my classes I am going to drop it because I just can't do it..

"Hey there, first time poster here..I recently started Wellbutrin for depression & fatigue and I'm looking for some advice. After agonizing about it for weeks I finally decided to give it a try and WOW. Just wow. My mood shot up within 2 days and I had more energy than I ever remember having. The first day was pretty crazy, within 30 minutes of taking the pill I felt like I slammed back 10 coffees and my head was racing. Chilled out a lot after the first day, and from then on my mood and focus were fantastic. But- I started having some pretty substantial chest tightness and mild sternum pain. That's the only side effect I seemed to be having, and a pretty worrying one. So my doctor told me to go off of it until I can see her again and my moods plummeted since then. It was like having a taste of the good life, only for it to be taken away.I haven't seen my doctor yet, but has anyone else had this symptom? Was it temporary? I was keen on Wellbutrin because of it not effecting weight/sex drive as much as other anti depressants. it was hard enough to convince myself to start it in the first place, let alone a different kind that affects those things. Is there anything similar to Wellbutrin?","1"
"I've recently come to terms with the fact that I am depressed. Looking back at my life and experiences it's now painfully obvious that I've never truly been happy, it's only for short bursts then I slump back into this pit of despair. I've never stood up for myself, I let people just walk over me, I just exist. I'm a side character. I can't find it in me to tell the girl I love how I feel. I've told myself over and over that I can overcome my insecurities, and I always try to motivate my friends to do the same, but it's all fucking talk and no action. I just want to go back in time and fix it all. I'm a coward. My dad died when I was 15 and when he was alive he never really guided me as fathers usually did, so now here I am 18 years old having no clue how to stand up for myself, how to express myself, or how to even be myself. It's like there's times where I feel like I can do anything and that I can beat this depression, then my dumb ass can't work up the courage to do the things I want, then I fall back into the pit. That's where I am now if you can't tell, last week was pretty nice mentally, but now here I am again with no real progress made. I want to get a phd in psychology and I want to become a therapist to help people like me, and that's something I'm dead set on doing. I want to be normal, I want to live as freely as I can, I want to tell my friends how I feel, I want to tell the girl I love how I feel, but these ingrained feelings of hopelessness feel impossible to ditch. If someone can help me, give me words of wisdom, empathize or tell me what to do I'll be forever grateful. Thanks for reading.","1"
"Im 19 and all my life ive been kinda weird thats just an objective fact the world was always distant and i always knew id have trouble trying to intergrate myself into it.I used to be so upbeat with a positive outlook on litrally EVERYTHING, goals, a plan about what i wanted to do with life. Somwhere in the middle of highschool somthing changed everything became fake, i was exposed to the rot of society and the nature of human beings. Innocence lost.A few months ago things started changing again this time is was different, it was activly strange. People started approaching me, people with severe depression or manic loneliness. This gradually built to the point of insanity where there was this one guy actually offering me 1000 dollars just to be his freind (i turned it down). There was about two new people every week for a while and i felt like nothing was real it was just some dream where i was surrounded by a hord of people. My daily commute to work would has me greeting entire bus stations at a time.I hate it.Theres another thing you should know about the way i am in the world, the way i talk to people, it is apparently unique and makes people trust me like... super trust me. People tell me secrets and i dont know why. I can make a freind within seconds just by talking to them.Ive since retracted into my head, my average free day includes doing absolutly nothing including eating unless its right there infront of me, i stare at the wall for hours just to pass the time.I broke up with my girlfreind becuase the idea of having to care for somone seemed more work than it was worth and im scared shitless becuase everything i do takes up so much effort and i dont mean physicle laybor i mean stuff like feeling sad and happy and pretty much every emotion im already bored of them as i feel them, IF i feel them, which is getting rarer and rarer. People tell me that everyting IS sane and my life really IS just somwhat... erratic. But they dont live it, they dont know whats its like to see patterns in everything. To know what somone is going to say befor they say it.I didnt know where else to post this so please any help/advice would be appreciated.","1"
"I feel no sense of urgency, and it's seriously messing my life up. Since I was younger, I've never felt like I'd be in trouble if I was late to school or a meeting, but it only really hit me hard 2 years ago during sixth form. I failed 2 subjects out of 3 because I would be 2 hours late every single day.Now, I'm finding it really hard to just survive - I'm loaded with course work, an extremely stressful homelife, and I just don't know what to do. I feel like I'm keeping myself up but my head is underwater.I desperately, desperately want to be able to get up and out of bed, but I just can't stop myself from rolling over and falling back to sleep. I really want to go outside and enjoy it, but even the thought of getting dressed stresses me. I've been told that this is because of my attitude - I'm always saying ""give me a minute"", but then I take 5. But to me, just gathering the energy to simply stand up or even move my arms is a colossal effort, and not even my family seem to understand. To be quite honest I don't know where to go with this, so I'm posting here as a last resort. Does anyone know why I just can't seem to feel that sense of urgency? Has anyone experienced this in their lives? Because honestly, I'm so lost and I've tried going to a doctor, I've tried counselling, and now I just don't know what to do.","1"
"So I know this is stupid but I still regularly talk to my ex. We broke up two years ago but we were together for two and half years. I gr very close with his family and we couldn't imagine just not talking to each other almost of a sudden. He recently told me that he started seeing some girl, she kind of looks like me and has similar life goals. While I am no longer physically attracted to him, I am still emotionally hooked. The thought of him apparently replacing me with a a lookalike, a better model is making my panic attacks come back. I don't know if it's just that he had to choose someone so similar or something else. I'm literally stuck, I have no family where I am and he's the closest person I have to family here but every time I think about him and my double my whole chest aches and I feel like I'm going to black out. It's been happening sporadically for a week now and I can't sleep. The thought of not talking to him anymore hurts more than still speaking to him. I need to find a way to cope with these anxiety attacks. It's crippling! ","1"

"So Ive been having a very hard time lately. Some of my closest friends have been treating me like garbage and I have nobody to go to. My lifelong best friend has recently left the church we both grew up in and he told me to never speak with him again. I dont care if he leaves our church, I dont understand why he asked me to not speak with him.I meet a girl recently just before she moved away to school. After she left we planned two dates where I could come visit, the first one went great, the second started great. It was a 4 day date, the first day was amazing, during the second we talked about the future and such, the third day I told her about my struggles with depression. She told me she would be there for me, that she cared. I told her how all of my friends in the past have left me, or just ignore me. She promised not to do the same. I thought I was in love. Fourth day she told me she was sick and I should probably just go home. Three weeks later she asks me to stop calling and texting her with no explanation.These are just two of the most recent stories. EVERY FUCKING FRIEND I MAKE DOES THIS TO ME! I dont trust anybody anymore. When ever I meet anybody nice I just assume they will do this to me. My desire to go anywhere is dead, my desire to make new friends is dead. I cant pull myself to trust anybody, I sometimes find myself wondering when my dog will leave and find somebody better. Every depression help video/website and such says talk to somebody about it. I dont want to talk to anybody. This anonymous post to a bunch of people who I dont think I would trust irl is about all I can muster right now. Why are people such garbage? And why do I feel the only way to get over this is to find the right person? ","1"
"If your depression is any similar to mine, it is feels almost tangible. It seems to want things from me. It wants me to stay in bed all day, not study, not feed myself properly, etc. I hate my depression. So much. It is the scariest thing I have ever had to deal with in my life. The fact that it could kill me someday is utterly terrifying. About a week ago I had a small break in my depression. I started to feel again and get actually ok for the first time in months. This lasted a couple days. I started to feel myself slipping back into my depression. When I felt myself slipping out back in all I felt was hate. Hate at my depression. And so I really started to fight it this time. I think before I was just trying to run from it. Anyway the way that has been helping me is with every action that happens in my day I have to ask myself is this what my depression wants? Then I act according. So if I want to sleep in Ill ask  will this feed my depression the answer for me is yes. So I get up early. Just an example. I know this is isnt the solution for everyone but I hope someone can benefit. It has been helping me a lot. Obviously this sucks and I know how draining literally everything is with depression. But it helped me to start small. Like making sure I brush my teeth and shower. And moving on to things like cooking myself real food.Its always scary and hard to do anything with depression.

"Hi everyone, I needed to go to the supermarket this morning. At first (as most of the time) I did not enjoy leaving home. Arriving there I was surprised, I was picking things up, smiling at the people, listening to the songs that they played (A horse with no name - America) and finding them so beautiful and in the end it was a very pleasant experience that improved my day. While I was in the market I began to reflect ""Would it be that staying home all the time in the bedroom does not make sadness and melancholy worse and worse?"" I know that as I many have a hard time interacting with the outside world, but I have experienced good times from the moment I decide to act and leave the room. As my doctor says, at first everything looks awful but getting there can do us good. So I ask, how has your social experience been? Leave home, go to work, find friends, family, have a positive role in recovery, negative, or depends? I am seriously advising to return to work as an incentive to feel better, more part of society and more natural. What do you say?","1"

In the last 3 months I've had an operation on my shoulder, stopping my entire escape route (music) in its tracks, which also stopped me from working and so have had no money, then 2 days after my op my brother who had been suffering with cancer for 3 years died right in front of me, I watched life leave him.

"Hi, I'm new here and just really need to go to a place where people understand and could be going through what I am. I think I've been depressed since I was a little girl. Songs would come on and I'd be sad. I always wanted to be someone else, and I would some days feel a physical ache when I woke up with the longing to not be me. To add to this, nothing in my life has ever come easy. Once my mom even said, poor (my name). Nothing ever seems to work out for her. It's that old clich, everything I've gotten, I've gotten the hard way. I'm definitely not someone who kind of glides through life. I had a job for 20+ years. I was a good worker who regularly got excellent reviews from supervisors and co-workers. I lost my job in 2014, and I've never gotten over it. I can't find another job. My husband is regularly working 70 hours a week at his job, and we still can't pay the bills. Today we got a notice our water will be shut off. My son is non-verbal autistic; my husband is an alcoholic; I have no job and can't find one. Before my first son was born in 2005, I had a stillbirth. I had to carry my dead baby girl for 48 hours until they induced labor. I just feel like I've been dealt no breaks and can't get one. With the way this country is going too, I just feel like I don't want to be here anymore. The only thing keeping me is my two boys. I love them more than anything and they are both ""mama's boys"" and I couldn't do that to them, but I also feel like I'm just at a dead end and though my life has never been a blast to me, now things I used to like are no longer fun. I feel so defeated and sleep so much everyday now when the kids are in school. I can barely afford to feed them and provide for them right now. I have a Bachelor's degree for gosh's sakes, and can't even get a job as a library aide at my son's school. Nobody wants me and I just am so tired. I've been saying that line that Demi Moore said in St. Elmo's fire for years: ""I never thought at this age I'd be so tired of life."" I'm so tired of life :(","1"
"Bonjour, my name is Nabila Salisu . I am a 23 years old mom of a two year old, and I live in Stamford,Connecticut.I have a suffering from a rare skin condition that I contracted when I was 14 years old .Both of my ears have abnormal growths called keloid which have grown to a substantial size. I have undergone 2 surgeries as well as injections and cryotherapy and none of them was successful. They itch constantly and send sharp stinging pains through the skin. I constantly cover it with my hair and scarfs. It bothers me a lot even my daughter is scared of them.I am unable to wear earrings, and I can't even wear nice short hairstyles. In addition to the pain,It is also making me depressed to the point I don't even go out and I'm scared to have friends . So I am asking for any financial assistance that you are able to give because I can't afford the treatment and I do not have any insurance to cover it. I've found a keloid specialist that I want to perform my surgery ( Dr Michael jones/keloid specialist) and I need to have surgery and radiation therapy. I will be very thankful if you can please help me remove them to regain my confidence. Thank you for your time and the love .

"Hello there. This must be some sort of depression. It all happened last year. Year before that was my most active, talkative year. I was 11th grade then. I was a  curious, passionate boy. I would try to develop math formulas, do physic/chemistry/biology related things. Details don't matter, I was trying to attend a competition. Important thing is that suddenly I was able to act like myself more because I needed other people then and my topics were interesting, people would help. Teachers helped. Result, many unique and repeated attempts failed but I was happy, I continued, I attended the competition next year! 12th grade is the grade when students here study for university entrance exams. Due to my problems with my parents, for the first time in my life I left my parents for long time by living in a dormitory.First part is nice. Second part is where I tell you what went wrong. In the 11th grade, a girl transfered to my school. She liked me for a reason. Then when I noticed that I liked her too. She tried contacting with me, I let it happen. She was very prig and strict with what she wants; by contrast, I was sensitive and soft; therefore, I knew it wouldn't work out. I preferred just being friends and avoided her, acted cold, even tried to date another girl which left my school shortly after (I didn't cause her to leave, lol).Well, she and her friends never understood why I acted cold  I know I am wrong, I should just have said no but I wanted to keep being friends too probably due to I was still liking here and perhaps she knew that and that was the reason why she didn't understand my coldness. Furthermore, I was known for being different (noone cares science and stuff but me there (few exceptions)); therefore, they blamed my unexpected behaviours for my different personality. My teachers jokingly called me ""not human"" and my friends jokingly called me that too. And due to I don't like telling my problems to my friends and I don't like yelling, I couldn't remove these words. After that, (12th grade) I felt like I wasn't thought like I am a human like them, I didn't have same rights with them. I was blamed for all trouble, even for those were only theirs. Damn!So at early times of 12th grade I was steel cheerful myself, all those crushing things haven't happened yet and I broke that girl's hearth. Simply, I didn't apologize for a mistake I have done and then she even told me she waits for an apology but I insisted on the fact that I was right. She was mad but she saw I don't respond her madness even though I understand, she felt something like, unreasonableness? And that feeling crushed something I think. Maybe not, I can't know how she feels. But I felt something very bad, it wasn't a feeling actually, it was a mess of my collapsing feeling system. It was collapsing due to I didn't care how I feel like and pushed myself to do opposite and I forced myself to believe this is right and the other is wrong. I denied my feelings or sth like that. Time is up. I gotta go.","1"

"I was already dealing with feelings of depression, suicidal thoughts, and a sense of utter meaninglessness for the last year or two, despite being on antidepressants, but things just got a lot worse. I won't go into detail on the insanely long list of other things that have happened one after the other this year, like my mother in law dying of cancer, multiple ER visits, being laid off, etc. But things just went to a new level. My 12 year old son's mom abandoned him about a month ago. I always wanted custody, but I never wanted it this way. I've spent many nights crying at the thought of how bad he must be hurting. But before he could even get settled in with us, he confessed something terrible: He has been repeatedly molesting his baby half sisters. I can't even process this. I feel like the universe is crashing down on my head, and taking my family with me. My son was already suicidal before this. Now I've had to send him away to my parents right after his mother abandoned him. My wife is threatening to leave and take the girls with her. I don't know what to do. I am so tempted to just take the easy way out and end it now. I have always battled with depression, but I never thought my life could turn to shit like this, not to this extreme. I was on unstable footing already, trying to find a way to care when I'm an involuntary nihilist. Now everything is destroyed. My son's life is ruined. My daughters' lives may be ruined too, if they remember what happened. Our family is being ripped apart. Please, lie to me and tell me things will be okay.","1"
"Hi Im 26 and have had depression for most of my life. When I was 2 I lived through a mass shooting. While I have no memory of said shooting, I have had extreme terror pop up where Im crying and want to hide/be somewhere safe. The first time this happened was when watching a tv show where a mass shooting took place. It was too real for me. I couldnt turn off the tv from fear and just cried there. This was when I was about 22.  Within the past month Ive had similar terror attacks but caused by nothing relating to mass shooting. All I had was a solid fear for my life and wanting to find a safe place. Once in that safe place, all I could do was cry. I expressed to my bf that I feel like Im having ptsd and he laughed at me thinking I was joking. When told otherwise he began to argue that Im just having a panic attack. But thats not what Im feeling. Ive had panic attacks before but non that gave me the feeling of pure terror and needing to hide. So am I having ptsd flare ups?","1"

"I moved to and now live in a city I hate, go to a university full of stupid people, I have no friends, I have so much shit I have to do, and I have a buttload of medical problems at 25. Oh, and my insurance is about to run out because I'm turning 26 and I will get to get on Medi-Cal (CA's Medicaid, which is absolute shit).I feel empty, grey, and emotionless. My partner wants more affection and physical intimacy from me, but I don't have anything to give. The pressure to initiate sex just overwhelms me even more because it's just one more thing for me to have to remember to do.I can't handle my life. There are too many responsibilities, I have too much going on, and no social support or anything like that to cope with it all. On top of everything, I'm always tired and can't concentrate on my work, whether it's schoolwork, or my projects at work. I can barely get up to go to work or school. In fact, I've missed quite a bit of school and work. If I could, I'd just sleep all day until I can leave this hellhole.Sorry, I'm rambling. I thought writing it out would help but I don't think it did. Everything seems pointless. There are a few things coming up which are objectively exciting but I feel nothing. I just want to disappear and not exist anymore. ","1"
"So I'm not 100% sure if this is the right subreddit but I think it fits here too._____So today I kinda found something out about me. I have to search for a contract that I have lying around somewhere. It's important for financial reasons and I'm procrastinating it since several weeks now. Which is weird. I just have to search for a contract in my own home. No biggie, right? Why would I procrastinate such an easy task? Well the problem is - just like with everything you have to search for - I don't know where it is. And I'm already assuming that I'm not going to find it. I already mentaly determinated that it's lost without even starting to look for it. So by doing that I eliminated the reason to look for it in the first place and reduced my chance of finding it from nearly 100% (because why would I throw it away?) to 0%.I also noticed that I do that for almost every other thing in my life. Why should I call the social security office? I already know I'm not getting my money. Why should I enroll at that school? I'm not going to graduate anyway.So as you can see this problem is responsible for a lot of trouble in my life. I would like to know how to end this behaviour. If you could help me with this I would be very grateful.","1"

"Just for background information:I have anxiety and depression. I've had it for over ten years (starting mid high school) I would say, but I've been getting help for it for about four years. I've been switched between different medications because nothing seems to help for long. My doctor doesn't offer many solutions, but he has always been my doctor. I've been told to get another one, but its a big process and you have to have pretty good reason to do so, especially around here where doctors are limited, and you are lucky if you have one at all. I've seen a one time psychiatrist, and he basically told me my depression isn't real depression, it's situational because I allegedly don't feel stable in my job. I've been told to go to school, and get a nursing job or something.I don't drive, and this is entirely because of my anxiety and attention span. I feel like I get too worked up, and I can't keep track of speed, traffic laws, and I am unfamiliar with it in general. I used to practice years ago, but not anymore. I gave up, and I don't see a reason to try anymore.  I work in retail, and I have a pretty good paying job. It's commission on top of hourly wages. I've been there a little over three years, so I've managed to get a few pay raises over the years. My job would be fine if it wasn't for the fact I have to deal with customers treating me like garbage nearly every day, and usually a couple times a day. I do what I can for people, and in a lot of situations such as with billing, I have to redirect people to our customer care line. When I can't provide the solution, people have a tendency to try to bully me. Even if someone held a knife to my throat, I have no way of accomplishing these things, but I am pushed around, and verbally abused anyway. I understand, this is something many people deal with in this day and age. The customers always feel like they should be given something for nothing just because they are paying something like everyone else is. I know this happens to other people, I just don't understand why I am failing so much at handling it.I always try to think about the fact that they are mad about the situation, and not at me specifically, but when they call me names, belittle me, and act like I'm stupid, I can't handle it. I put on a firm stance in front of them, and don't let them see what they are doing to me on the inside, but it eats at me. They have me feeling powerless, stupid, and incapable all the time. On top of that, as per expected, the company wants me to push on these people and try to talk them into spending more money when they are angry about their current rates. I feel like I am being pushed into a crowd of people with pitch forks. Then I stop and think about people who are in actual physical pain around the world, and people who have it worse off than I do, and I feel idiotic and selfish for feeling that way.I'm very sensitive, overly I'm sure, and I can't stop it. I wish there was a pill I could take that would make me feel nothing at all. I feel a lot of the time the only feelings I have are negative. I don't like to leave my house, and I don't even like going out to simple things like the movies. I hate everything outside of my own space. I feel like I spend so much time pretending to be something I'm not, that I don't even know who or what I am anymore. I don't think I want to know either.I mentioned in an earlier post that I am suicidal in the sense that I am ok with dying, and I would gladly switch with someone who wants to live longer, but I am not suicidal in the sense that I would actually kill myself. I couldn't do that to my mom, my boyfriend, or anyone who actually cares about me.I just don't know what to do, and I don't know how to stop feeling so bad about everything. I feel like I shouldn't be living like this, but any help I've searched out ends in disappointment. I'm just supposed to take a pill that takes away maybe a portion of my problems, and be happy with it. The only advice I seem to get is to change jobs, which if you lived here, you would know there is nothing but retail jobs. The other advice is for me to change doctors, and as I've said before, it's not so simple. Maybe these pieces of advice are what I should be doing, but I'm not so sure...","1"

"You're going to have good and bad days, but you have to remember nothing happens overnight.Tip 1: Be ProactiveLearn what triggers you to feel depressed, and try to avoid them. Life is hard, and you can't avoid everything that brings you down, but some things you can. On the flip side, learn what helps to get you out of the fog of depression. The next time you feel depressed, when you finally snap out of it, try to remember what helped you.Was it a song?A type of exercise you were doing?Or someone you where talking to?If you write it down it will help remember. The next time you feel depressed, YOU WILL HAVE SOME TOOLS YOU CAN USE.One thing you can try is set a reminder in your calendar to smile or to do something that makes you happy. Taking some type of control over the way you feel is one of the most important things you can do.Tip 2: Stop feeding your depression.If you go around using negative terminology such as...I'm so depressed today,today is going to suck,I'm worthless,...you are feeding your depression; your subconscious hears these words and starts to make you feel them. So if you say today is going to suck, your mind starts to look for things to prove your point right, so you will start to notice all the negative things around you.But if you use positive terminology such as...today is going to be a great day,I am an amazing person,I feel so happy today,...your subconscious will hear these words and start looking for things that are positive.The way you stand and your facial expressions can also feed your depression.People that are depressed usually don't stand up straight, they are slumped over and they look sad. There's a saying:motion creates emotion.The way you carry yourself can dictate your feelings.Doing something as simple as forcing a smile on your face even when you don't feel like it can help change your mood.Working out can also help you feel better; the hormones that get released get as you workout gives you a type of high that makes you feel a little happier.Tip 3: Don't be hard on yourself or others.They say life is a journey. When it comes to depression, you have to have that mindset. You're going to have good and bad days, you're going to take 100 steps forward and 200 steps back and your first instinct is to get frustrated with yourself, but you have to remember nothing happens overnight.You're also going to have friends and family that have never experienced depression tell you just to get over it or just snap out of it, and that can be frustrating. They don't understand it's not as simple as deciding to not be depressed. You have to remember if they never experienced depression they don't know any better. Don't get frustrated with them, just try to explain to them how you feel.The thing is, most people really do care and really do want to help, they just don't know how. The worst thing you can do is lash out or make them feel bad for not understanding your pain. Depression is not just hard on you, but also the people around you.My ExperienceI've been dealing with depression for most of my life and I have made a lot of mistakes.And I used to get down on myself, but the more I thought about it, I realized that everything worth doing take some time to get right so I just have to learn as I go and never give up.","1"

"I don't feel myself anymore. I feel like hurting myself or other people, I hate myself so much I don't know how long I can keep up the charade of be being happy with myself. I've lost passion for school and work I feel like killing myself, I just want someone to talk to.","1"

"I felt like that many times I want to tell you there is hope I know because I am proof. I met someone so amazing who changed my life His name is Jesus Christ. Before Jesus I was sad, empty, confused, lonely worried, wanted to give up but Jesus showed me hope and changed me from the inside out. I know how how it feels to be bullied, I know how it feels to be lonely. I know how it feels to be almost homeless i know how it feels to have no friends, i know how it feels wanting to die, i know how it feels to not feel loved, i know how it feels to be sick, i know how it feels to lose someone you love, i know how it feels to be raped. i know how it feels to be have paretns divorce. I know how it feels <3333333333 Jesus knows too He was abused, abandoned, not wanted, not loved by His own people, hungry, tired, sad, angry. He felt it all. I feel like someone needs to see this. You are loved more than you can know by the creator who died for you and your sins so you can have a relationship personally with Him. God Sent His Son Jesus Christ to die for us, God became a man . He wants you and desires to talk to you and communicate with Him. He knows everything about you, the hairs on your head, when your lonely, when you need someone to talk to,HE never sleeps, HE never lies, He cares for you. It doesnt matter what you did come to Him and You will be at peace you will still deal with things because we have an enemy who wants to destroy us but Jesus is there now your not alone. Trust me Jesus has helped me everytime, He is worthy to be trusted. God will take you as you are and change you <333333333 If you want to know Jesus Christ, the one who loves you more than your parents ,friends. He is waiting for You to accept His gift of salvation that Jesus died for your sins and God rose Him from the grave. Say a prayer with me now. Jesus I am so sorry I sinned against you please forgive me. I want to follow You i want that peace that I heard You have. Thank you for dieing for me. Change me from the end side and out. Thank You Jesus Thank You God for raising Jesus from the grave. I love You. I pray this in Your Holy name Jesus.","1"

"Ive suffered from depression since middle school, possibly earlier than that. I am now 25 (f). For my whole life I have just gone through the motions not really trying to identify where it stems from and just letting it pass. Ive done that for so long and this year seems to be the hardest. I recently started therapy for the very first time in my life and was finally confirmed that I am a person who suffers from depression. (I mean, I went looking for help so that had to mean something right?) Because this year has been a bit harder for me, so I feel like right now, I am trying extremely hard not to go so deep in. Not sure if I have ever been in a deep depression but I mean to the point where I give up. I feel like Im so close to completely giving up and I really dont want to. I dont want to be that person. My therapist has of course given me ideas of things I could do to feel better but Im a complete procrastinator. So other than therapy, what are some things you guys try to do to get yourself out of it?","1"
"So Ive struggled with depressive tendencies since middle school probably (20 F). I say tendencies because Ive never actually been diagnosed or anything. In the past Ive managed to keep it all pretty well under control with exercise and martial arts, but because of an injury thats not an option anymore. Ive been having a really hard time the last few months. I dont want to do anything. Just this last week I stayed home from work and school the whole week, because I just couldnt make myself go. Nothing is fun. I have trouble sleeping but dont want to get out of bed ever. My appetite is all over the place, I either dont eat at all or I overeat. Any advice would be appreciated. I dont really know what to do. ","1"
"Do any of you have this problem?I have always had this problem, and it has also often contributed to my depression.Ever since I was a kid, I would always be late everywere I go. Every morning I would be late for school etc.It's like my brain just doesn't ""turn on"" at the appropriate time.I have already tried everything.But I would hope that you guys have some advice anyway.","1"

"I am not an educated person- not an expert at anything. But please - if you are hurting - take a moment in time with me .I know alot of people are going to take one look at this and say ""TL:DR fuck that "" thats fine. You can go about your business - the words i present will simply be presented to you at a different time , in different forms - over and over until you are curious enough or motivated to get it this is not just for you , this is for me as well . However - If share with me some time --time i took to write this, the time you take to read and the time we share to comprehend -- i feel that things can be Gained for both of us .""Sometimes you Lose to Gain"" how many times have you heard that cryptic ass message ? Let me tell you what I know to be true - something ive experienced and my interpretation of that experience . I understand that much of what i say and write is also cryptic - my writing style strange. I will do my best to convey the message in my heart in the best possible way , so we may both survive this suffering.we lose and gain a great many of things in our life - in every stage of it. friends , opinions , beliefs - somethings the changes are big and sometimes they are little . But what happens we start to lose the physical things ? what happens when the things that we have used and worked for - that we need to ""survive"" in this society get taken away - while our minds flash to the dozens of homeless we walk by every day - filling us with that future fear of self? we lose Hope What happens when your whole life you are different , you have issues - you dont fit in or belong - you try and try and try to do things but you just dont change . you keep repeating the same shit over and over - a revolution of self destruction with the creation of the new? you lose hope - over and over you go - lose hope . Some of us will Choose to end it all.First let me tell You this - UNDERSTAND THIS. Think of all this pain you are going through right now - all this Suffering - the feelings of hopelessness - I want you to recognize right now every fucking fiber of pain in your life yes I want you yo know its there , I want you to Feel it .NOW i want you to think of your Family , Friends Whoever you have Love for - even those who you have had a falling out with and know for a dumb reason. I want you to think of all of them . ........think....... if you are at the point in your life that you are considering making a Choice to force yourself from this ""Living"" realm - we are our choices -I ask only that you consider this following question -- ""Do I want to pass this Pain onto Them?"" Because that what you are doing - you think you are ending your suffering but that is not the truth - Pain is a way to recognition suffering - both those words cover a multiple of things and although many will consider the same - try looking at them separate . Right now you are Suffering in many ways - Suffering physically and mentally - causing you Pain in your body - your heart and mind . Although these things can be considered separate they are also intertwined . Energy cannot be destroyed - So although you may be ending the physical pain of your suffering - you will not be ending your suffering - It will simply be passed around to all those who you hold dear - all those who you love and have loved you . Its weight is added to their own suffering - your old pain added to theirs . Now there is a Good chance one of them will also make that Choice - the cycle and transfer continues . maybe your suffering is caused by some of those who are supposed to love you - maybe they have hurt you and you think this is the perfect way to get back at them . THINK ABOUT THIS - for all those who have hurt you , there are also those who Love - even if you cant remember right now or see them - you gotta believe they are there because they are . Is giving them your pain as well really worth it?There is Hope - There is Hope yes let me tel you there is Hope . I know this - ive experienced these things . thats why I can go through them again now - sit in this fire and not be afraid. Let me tell you my friends - why there is hope .You think these things that are slowly being taken away from you are things you need to survive. physical or otherwise - things you have worked towards and have built up and protected. things people say you needed or positions that you felt you needed to do - even right now - Its a feeling of non-belonging . even after all this time , its just not working - and now they are being taking away . these last bits of things that we think are keeping us together . Its not the end - who decides that ? who decides to be where - to do what ? who makes the choices ? You. So as long as you make the Choice to move forward - there is hope.We have experienced it - the strange powers of the Universe - the way it aligns things at just the right moments - the way it moves us into situations for reasons often at the time - far beyond our comprehensions. But sometimes we dont need to Comprehend - we just need to trust in our grip and keep hanging on - we need to release ourselves from the fear induced visions of future - of what we think we will become because if not - we will become it . In this time of Change - Hang on - there are so many more thing to see and experience. Hang on and breathe - do not be afraid and Open your mind to the Possibilities of these new experiences your reality can unfold into - think about it.Maybe now - without these things that you thought you needed - you can experience thing you could have not before - because you had these things!Life is not easy - I do not know exactly what you are going through but I do know this - We all go through this life with our burdens of suffering - it is our duty not pass them to others or to carry them ourselves - but to hold each others shoulders and walk together - making sure none of us fall behind . Moving together with the understanding not of our individual pain - but our Unified suffering - Moving Forward towards Healing .It is worth it - You are worth it - Do not succumb under the burden of your Suffering but rather - Hold your head high and back straight and move forward - If you stumble you have your friends to hold you - if you see others you pick them up . This is Your - OUR- Purpose . There are possibilities for you - there are Choices - There is Hope.You Can do this - This is the Proof - you have shared this time with me this far.Yes you Can do this - you are being molded so you may become something else - so you May evolve - do not Fear the change . This is not an easy thing to do - but you can do it . This is the Narrow Path.","1"
"Theres nothing left for me. I dont look forward to anything in life...and nothing can make me happy. The only reason Im still alive (even after 3 suicide attempts in my past) is cuz I dont want to break my familys heart. I dont want to work or go to school anymore, I dont want to leave my bed anymore. I dont want to eat anything. I just want to sleep and never wake up but I cant because I still have to pay rent/bills. I feel trapped. I cant cry even though my soul hurts so much....Ive been through a lot of shit is all I can say....more than what most people could even think of....and everyone says theres a light at the end of the tunnel but honestly I see nothing. Theres nothing for me at the end of the tunnel. I give up. Are there such things as rehabs or like places where I can just have shelter and just not do anything? Im broken and just useless. Theres no point in me being alive at all. Im not gonna kill myself even though I have suicidal thoughts everyday Ive learned to manage it slightly...I just dont want to do anything anymore, I dont want to talk to people or see anyone.

"All my feelings about life: I dont enjoy having friends,talking with people, having people/family take care of me and make conversation,eating good food,having sex,driving fast cars,going shopping,buying jewelry I dont laugh at anything, i am not interested in any hobby Previously my goal in life was money but now I see that what will money bring me if i cant enjoy anything or not interested in anything whatsoever? My daily life is made up of studying for a business degree(or desperately trying to, very unproductive and retaining and understanding information is extremely hard) and nothing else. I sleep when I am tired of studying because I find nothing else to do to be interesting. Studying is a requirement so I force myself to do it (very hard, I am sleeping more than actually studying). I would sleep all day if I wasnt at university. My parents are paying for my expenses and university(do not think it is me who want to be there). LIFE HAS BECOME EXTREMELY BORING THAT I HAVE NO PURPOSE OF LIVING. I HAVE NOT CHOSEN SUICIDE BECAUSE I THINK THERE IS SOMETHING TO LIVING THAT I AM NOT SEEING NOW. Could you help me?

"I found out i had HSV2 about 4 months ago. My ex was basically a man whore and I made the stupid mistake of sleeping with him after the break up (so I know it was my fault) I only had one outbreak, the initial one. Since then I have been very up front with the men I see and then i never hear from them again. It's really starting to make me depressed and ruin my self esteem. I really liked the last guy and he claimed to be okay with it but now he isn't speaking to me. I had luck with one guy who did not seem to care but we didn't end up working out and had nothing to do with the herpes. I am just sad and devastated that people are thinking of this as a deal breaker. I think I have a lot of integrity because I always tell them which is hard to do. How do I deal with this constant rejection, I am seriously so depressed.","1"

"A bit of backstory here. I broke up with my high school girlfriend of three and a half years in 2013. I didn't want to do it, but I was involved in a really questionable church at the time and they convinced me it was the right thing to do. I broke up with her and soon found myself out of the church. I tried to get back together with her, but she had no interest in talking to me. Over the last, almost five years now, I have cycled between being ok and being terribly depressed. I have tried to make contact with her on a couple of occasions, with her either publicly calling me out or threatening to get a restraining order. I even attempted suicide in 2015.      I got help and was feeling better for a long time. Fast forward to tonight and I'm scrolling my facebook feed when I see a picture of her with a mutual friend. She's so beautiful and happy and all the feelings of regret and sadness and helplessness came rushing back. Part of me wants to find her and tell her how I feel while another part knows that's a bad idea. Part of me wants to do something stupid and reckless to take my mind off of it. But my entire inner voice won't stop screaming that I will somehow never get over her, and I'm not normal, and I will never be able to move on and have a normal relationship.     I don't know what I'm looking for with this post. I just needed to get my feelings out I guess. Any advice? Will I ever move on?","1"
"I have a friend and we're really close, she loves far away but we keep regular contact. She is very depressed about her education. She studies well and gets good marks but she constantly thinks that she's not worth anything. She is always depressed and sad all the time. I try to cheer her up, but my words don't help and I don't know what to say. Any attempt to cheer her usually ends in a fight. She started getting depressed when she couldn't get in the college she liked and then life seemed to lose all point. But she still wants to achieve a lot, although under the constant feeling of worthlessness. What can I say to cheer her up and get her back on track? Thank you in advance. ","1"
"Hey everyone.  I posted about this a month or so ago.  I am 25 sessions in and have about 2 weeks to go.  Overall I still feel the same old me.  I am unhappy with my medication because I feel that it makes me feel emotionally flat.  When I was unmedicated I had my lows but I also had my highs and enjoyed things in life.  Now I don't hit those lows but I also do not hit the highs....Anyways, after a month of treatment doing the TMS, I have slowly started noticing that I don't seem to have that constant dread in the back of my mind.  You know, like a day will go by and I'll realize that I didnt have a suicidal thought or that I made it through a day without giving up, cancelling plans, calling out, etc...  These are just small victories and they could be coincidental but I am hoping they are the beginning signs of the TMS treatment's success. I really encourage anyone that has TMS available to them to give it a try.  It takes about 45 minutes each day for 35 days.  It is a big commitment and is tough to schedule but I feel like the Pro's outweigh the Cons.  It doesn't hurt, doesn't interfere with medication and doesn't have any side effects.  I will post a summary of my treatment when I finish in a couple of weeks.  ","1"
"Hey there everyone. I dont know what do to anymore or how to cope with all the things without talking to somebody, so I use this to get some things of my chest..My Name is Alexandra, Im 20 years old. I got out of an abusive relationship 2 years ago, depressed and isolated. With a little bit of luck I found my soon to be best friend. Lets call her Jenny to protect the privacy of her. Jennifer pulled me out of my isolation and was my everything. I had a terrible drinking habit (in my country its legal to drink alcohol at the age of 18), low self esteem and what not. After I began socializing with other people again, I met my soon to be other best friend. Lets call him John for the sake of it. These two couldnt handle each other, even if their life depended on that. For the sake of keeping things a bit shorter;Jenny found someone she really endeared and got into a relationship with him and unluckily for me, I fell in love with his best friend (unrequited). The two boys were in a band with their best buddies and I made the shirt designs and album cover for them. I was so happy. I thought nothing could knock me out. About 6 months ago, all escalated. John talked badly about Jenny and I believed him, because she couldnt be there for me as I may have needed her. I wasnt mad at all, but John threw wood in the fire. We fought heavily and the friendship I had over two years fell apart. Terrible things happened between her and me and at the end, she bullied me at instagram. A few weeks later, I gave a friend of mine shelter were she could be. I took her into my home and made everything possible to help her out of her problems. But over the time my best friend John would insult me in terrible ways, shove me out of his house, telling me, not wanting to see me again. This friend of mine talked to John how awful I would be. In the end, they both humiliated me and John would left me as well. Now its November 2017 and Im isolated again, I cant find a job, I cant step outside, I cant even listening to music without crying. I thought its gonna get a bit better with time, but today I saw my crush posting a photo of him and the shirts I designed, because they finally arrived. I dont know what to do, I want to be with Jenny again, I want to be happy again but all I can think of is what I made wrong and things arent fixable. These people were everything to me, these two kept me alive and I loved them as they were my siblings. But now there just ... gone. And I have no one left, nor the will to stay alive. Everything was so terrible without them, there was a light in the distance whenever I was with them...But now I cant even see that far...Does anyone of you have some advice? I cant handle this anymore...","1"

Im tired of doing this why cant i just stay happy and stop going into this dumb depression cycle its so annoying and its making my life worse i dont know what to do anymore im useless and no girls like me no matter how hard i try talking to them. Im not unattractive alot of my friends that are girls actually consider me very attractive but no girl seems to feel the same way just fucking kill me","1"
"So I've been at least somewhat depressed for a while. I'm currently a freshman in college and have no friends. My whole life I never really have any friend like I have some people I talk to but no close friends. College makes it worst it's so hard to make friends. So a bit of my background my mom left me when I was little. My dad then remarried and I lived with my dad and stepmom. I'd say our relationship really went downhill in the last few years. It made worst when my dad had to go oversea for work. Our relationship was never that great and made worst since high school. We would get into these unnecessary arguments. The thing is when it's over she pretended like nothing happened and just go on without life. Next time it would happen again and because we didn't talked about it, the same sht happened. During my senior year I called the suicide hotline because I felt really depressed because she would blow up on unreasonably. I talked to someone for counseling and my mom saw me talking on the phone. After I got off she ask me if I got the job since I applied for one around that time. I told her no I called the hotline. Then she was all like why did you call them and I told her it's because of how she treated me. She then told me she couldn't love me as much because I'm not her biological child but to talk to her next time if there's an issue and not to call the hotline.That's bs because she would get mad everytime there's an issue especially if it's with her and she won't admit it's her fault. As far as her comment on me not being her biological child, she also said she never really want kids in the first place because of the maintenance they require. I really want to flip the argument and ask her if child was a problem why did you get into this marriage? She had the benefit of the doubt. I'm pretty sure she got married even with child as an issue is because she got too emotional and the thought of marriage was too exciting. Of course she didn't thought about potential issues. Since then I have learn to not get emotional with things and think more open-minded like weigh the good and bad of something before making a decision. I'm also thinking about not marrying due to bad experience with my stepmom, I think of kids as German cars (expensive maintenance, require constant care, problematic). The worst part is my dad and brother is aware of the issue and instead of trying to work it out as a family, they like to suck up to her and just say it's wrong but let her be. Same with my grandparents. We don't sit down and talk about problems as a family we each just go our own way. More recently, me and my stepmom have gotten into heated argument about me driving. This was senior year and I wanted to learn to drive. My dad wasn't here so I couldn't ask him. I asked her like once or twice during the year and she said no which I was really disappointed. I know I could go to driving school but it's expensive and I'm a really cheap person. A week before I graduated high school I decided to ask her nicely and hope she would do it because I'm about to graduate and we're in a good mood. Well big mistake.... I asked her nicely and she blew up on me saying I asked her too many times and she can't do it. I've only ask her like twice before. Since then I'm disappointed and I still think about it today. It makes me mad when I do because I asked her nicely and she had to be rude. Was it hard to say no and explain herself in a normal voice? So now I'm in college without a car. I think about this when I see other college students driving I get depressed. Even my dad knows but he defends her saying she can't. I'm just so depressed and it's been a while. Now I'm in college and nobody loves me. I need some advice. Sorry it's a long one but I just had a lot of depressed feeling.","1"
"I am 27 years old. I'm married, have been for 6 years. My wife and I have been together for over 10 years. I am 50+ lbs overweight. I have zero motivation or the time to work out or go run. I'm tired all the time, regardless of how much sleep I do or don't get. I don't eat very healthy. This is due to lack of time needed to prepare balanced meals and actually be able to sit down and eat. I usually resort to really quick fixes (fast food, pizza, Mac & cheese, Ramen, sandwiches, etc.). I have a steady, good paying job. The work that I do is extremely stressful, both mentally and emotionally. My place of employment is very short staffed right now. Almost everyone is putting in 12-16 hours of Overtime per week. I work opposite my wife so that we don't have to deal with outside child care.It My wife is 2 years younger than I. She is WAY overweight. She has no motivation to work out or run. She simply doesn't want to put in the effort. She eats even less healthy than I do because she is a very picky eater. She doesn't like most fruits or veggies. My wife also has a steady job. It doesnt pay that great, but it's a job. She hates it. Her job requires that she get up very early. Because of this, she is also tired all of the time and typically pretty crankyI have a 2 1/2 year old daughter. She is insanely cute and so full of love. I love her to pieces. She is also drives me insane. We recently transitioned her to a toddler bed and She is able to get out of bed whenever She wants. She whines and screams almost constantly. She's only been up for 2.5 hours today and has had 4 fits, each lasting up to 20 mins. She is very disobedient (typical toddler behavior, I know) but it really gets to me. She is super impatient and throws fits when she wants something but is told she has to wait (even if its just a few seconds). I lose my temper/patience with her quite often. I have never hit her out of anger or frustration, but I have yelled at her. Today while I was brushing her hair, she threw a fit (her 3rd one of the day) for no apparent reason. Out of frustration, I threw her hairbrush against the shower wall and it broke.I feel broken. I feel like a bad father. I feel like a failure as a parent. I rarely get any time to myself to unwind and de-stress. I hate feeling tired all the time. I hate being, in my opinion, fat. My sex life with my wife is almost non-existent due to her early work schedule and requires that shebgo to bed very early, typically right after putting my daughter to bed. There is no alone time during the day on our days off. I rarely get to to spend money on myself or go do things that I enjoy.I hate my life.

"24 y/o, college educated here. Going a little crazy and asking for Advice. I am very lonely and depressed and suicidal (but what else is new). Let's do a job run down.Anything less than 15$/h means i still have to live with my parents. (Not healthy)Sales is a horrible dirty field, makes me more depressed.Data entry/custmer service is something I have done. But spending all my time sitting at a computer punching in numbers makes me suicidal, I always quit these jobs eventually My parents put a lot of pressure on me to be a successful coder. But they don't/can't understand that I suck at programming. I'm thinking about being an electrician and going to trade school.The idea of driving to different places and thinking on the fly and working with my hands excites me. Might make it easier to get out of bed. But I don't want all the time and money I spent on college to be a waste. Also I just can't get a fucking job without experience. And the jobs I can get make me unspeakably depressed. I don't want to disappoint my parents, and I'm trying to stay alive. And I just feel like my whole life has been a wasted effort so far.Any blue collar workers (or happy workers) out there wanna put in their 2cents? Would be appreciated ","1"

"I'm in the midst of a pretty severe depression.  Going to a program that teaches great coping skills but a necessary part is you have to take their drugs, which makes me drugged up during the coping skills group and so I get frustrated.  Can't there be a program where you don't take drugs?  The head of finance at the program was pretty nasty and said it was because of liability and laweyers.  WTF? So you have to shove pills down my throat because you're going to get sued if you don't?  It's a fucked up system.  Any helpful feedback is greatly appreciated.","1"

"So, Hello... I guessI am going to format this like I was writing a letter, I feel more comfortable doing so. So I guess I should start with introductions... You can call me Shay, I prefer to be called that. I am 18 and have been depressed since I was about 13 with the death of my best friend, She was hit by a car in the parking lot of a store. After that I was really upset but hid it because I am the oldest of my family, So I still to this day have the mentality of ""If I am weak, They will leave"" so I act strong. A couple years went by and I remember starting to feel okay, And so I put myself back out into the world and made friends with this lovely gal. We dated for a bit but I ended up moving away from her, So I fell into a slump again. I don't remember much from this seeing how I was 14ish and have had a bad memory for as long as I can remember, But anyway, After the slump I ended up going to the internet for help, Which was a bad idea in retrospect, A young kid posting his feelings on a public fourm not designed for it. I was torn to pieces, People saying that the girl ran into the car for not loving me and I should've not moved away from the girl, She probably hates me now... So I started to believe these voices, Always putting myself down for shit I couldn't have had any control over while wearing this mask of a smile to hide how I really feel. Fast forward a couple years to age 16, I had just gotten out of school for the summer and was bored so I got on social media and I started posting pictures of the scenery of the area, Someone commented on it and I ended up talking to this person for quite some time, Her name was Kat, Or that's what she liked to be called anyway, So I started talking to her quite a bit before I had my phone taken away because of some reasons I don't feel comfortable giving exact details about but I ended up sending some messages I regret... So after about a year and a half with no phone, I got back on and I read the messages she had sent... She had shot and killed herself after about a month of not talking to me, Her parents had abused her and I was her only life line ya know? So I again, Fell into a deep depression, I wouldn't eat much, I hardly slept and that's when I first contemplated suicide... I didn't go through with it of course, Seeing how I am still here and decided to help people who were going through similar stuff. Fast forward to just yesterday... I was on the phone with my friend Gael, She's this amazing girl who I had been talking to for many years now... And she calls me crying her eyes out... I started talking her down and suddenly I hear her whisper ""I can't do this anymore"" and I heard cut her wrists and she went into the details on how it felt as she started bleeding out... I called 911 and everything but it was too late when they got there... She had passed away in her tub. I sat on the phone with her mother and helped her through it. Hearing her cry and sob... Today I was making myself a sandwich when it clicked in my head ""She's not coming back"" and I lost it, I ran to my room, locked myself in and just bawled my eyes out for a few hours... I don't blame myself for her death, I blame myself for not being able to stop it...I thank you for taking time to read this all... It means a lot to me.Thanks again,Shay","1"

I have been feeling so angry at life the past couple of days.I dont want to commit suicide just to have to put someone close to me through the hell of finding me, but that is the only thing holding me back honestly.Id absolutely seek assisted suicide/euthanasia if it were an option. I fear that Im going to end up alone, homeless, and even more miserable.Im so tired all of the time. Everyday.Ive taken so any pills and been through so many counseling sessions. Ive smoked weed.

"On the 22nd of May 2017, my life changed for the worst. But before I get into that, I will share with you my past. I have been suffering from anxiety and genetic depression since I was seven. I was bullied, I felt like I was an outcast (and I still do), but I wasn't happy. I have been to the doctors many times for mental health issues, but not one doctor prescribed me medication, or actually helped me. After that, I gave up. To this day I still suffer the on-going pain of feeling worthlessness and self-doubt.Anyway, now that you know a little bit about my past, here comes the part of my life that plays on my mind over and over again like a broken record. On the morning of 22nd of May, I was getting ready to see my idol and my favorite singer, Ariana Grande. My mum had bought tickets since it had been my birthday and I hadn't had a party yet. It was a surprise to think that for the first time, I was going to a concert! We left the house and got trains to the arena in Manchester. After a little while of waiting, we was allowed into the arena, and we took our seats. I sat on row A, it was the row that faced the doors into the foyer, so we were pretty much the first ones in the arena. I won't bore you with the details of how amazing Ariana is at singing and her performances. After the concert had ended, me, my mum and my sister all got up and walked down the steps into the foyer. It wasn't too busy which I was happy about because my anxiety causes me to be super afraid of crowds. I stopped by the merchandise booth and asked my mum if I could buy a poster, since the only thing I was able to buy was a ""DANGEROUS WOMAN"" elastic band bracelet. She got out her purse and flicked through the remaining money. She said no, since we needed the money for a taxi. I am so glad she said no... We made our way to the doors out of the foyer when the loudest and most booming noise emerged from behind us. The force was so powerful I felt the blast on my back, I was pushed forwards. My first instinct was ""RUN"" so that's what I did. I grabbed my sister quickly and ran so fast, it all seemed like I was in a movie. I looked behind me and saw a smoke cloud from inside. My heart was pounding, I couldn't breathe. We ran down the steps and out of the building itself. There was so many people running and screaming. My mum and sister was screaming in fear, but I just stood there, silent. I was in shock, I was shaking but I couldn't freak out. I frantically checked to see if anything had hit my mum or sister, checking for any scraped or cuts, thankfully, there was non. We walked across the road onto a grassy part, almost like a park. I sat down on the grass to catch my breath and calm down. Beside me stood up, was a bunch of young girls, somewhere around the age of 11-12. One of the girls had a big cut in her ankle, and was screaming and crying. Another girl in the group was screaming ""I DON'T KNOW WHERE MY MUMMY IS, SHE'S STILL INSIDE!"" All of a sudden I lost all control of myself and I cried and cried, I felt like I was drowning because I couldn't find my breath. I was having the biggest panic attack I had ever had. My mum was trying to call my dad but he wasn't picking up, and she didn't realise I was close to passing out. A woman came up to us and asked if we was okay, and talked to my mum for a while and tried to calm her down. She told us she ran a cafe close by where we could sit and have free drinks to help us. At this point I was still in a deep panic attack, she saw me and picked me up, talking to me and trying to get me to breathe. Once I caught my breath a little, I tried talking to her. I remember saying ""all I did was ran, and grabbed my sister and just ran. I thought I was going to die"". That woman helped us so much, and many other people. We sat at the cafe with a girl and her mum. The girl had a bleeding nose, she had hit it on something during the explosion. I am so lucky I wasn't hurt, but the mental trauma has and still is killing me slowly. I wish someone would understand the PTSD I face everyday. Every loud noise, every crowd chaos, everything that would make someone jump, makes me freak out. But no one understands, and I don't think anyone can help anymore. Not many people suffer PTSD, and it is something I would wish on no one. I am struggling so much to keep my head up, and to try and keep out the thoughts.One of the things that hurts me all the time. Is the 22 people who lost their lives that day. And one of them being Saffie. Saffie was an 8 year old little girl. She sat two seats away from my little sister during the concert. I saw her smile, I saw her sing... I saw her last smile. The last one she would ever make. That poor girl lost her life, one what would've been one of the happiest days of her life. As I'm writing this I'm crying just remembering her face. To know how much pain every family and victim has and is going through kills me. PTSD is real, so is depression and every other kind of mental illness. I just want to get a message across that people who have been through traumatic events should get help. I haven't gone to get help myself, because I am scared. And I feel alone and useless.Thanks for reading. I know this probably will never be read, but just in case it does, thank you for reading something to personal to me.","1"

"Lately I have been going through a lot of ups and downs. Life has honestly turned into a rollercoaster. I sometimes feel like no one understands me. I feel like no matter what i try to do I end up messing it up and end up a thousand times more nervous. I have developed various ticks due to constant nervousness. I used to smoke a large amount of weed to help escape but have stopped and in some way I'm glad cause I felt that it was really slowing me down and has caused some damage in the long run. I have felt lately that I'm getting back to how I used to be but am still lacking. I don't know why exactly I'm posting here other than I feel like I feel like I'm getting depressed and have reached a near state of constant anxiety to the point where I might as well be standing on nails nonstop.A bit of a more in depth look at me, I grew up in a foreign country and since i moved back home I have been viewed as a rich snob. I know that I have had a more entitled life than others but know that it was never easy. It got worse when I started self sabotaging, I went from drinking everyday to feel slightly happy and more relaxed. I then stopped the drinking and switched to weed. Having stopped smoking I feel like I'm constantly anxious. I know that not smoking after everything has caused some of the anxiety. My parents have tried everything to help but don't seem to understand the root of the problem. My wife seems to be unable to advise me or I feel like she has no compassion for my situation cause she had a much harder life. I sometimes get her when she says man up that my situation is not as bad but it feels that after a bit it feels like everything around me is crumbling.I apologize for the long windedness and hope to just hear a friendly voice or to hear some encouragement cause lately all I hear (especially from myself) is how I can't seem to do right.","1"

"Hey guys. I'm a 19 year old girl who goes to uni. In short, I'm a very lonely person. I don't have anyone to talk to, pretty much by myself all day every day. I try my best to be social and every day I go out of my way to see people and meet people. I'm not a hermit, but I just realize no one really sticks.Recently I broke down. I was supposed to go on a date with a guy, and he rain checked me 30 mins before our date. We haven't talked since, so I'm guessing it's going to amount to nothing.The point I'm trying to make is: he reminded me of what I truly am. A lonely person, I always will be one. No matter what. Every friend I have goes away. I'm not sure why anymore.I'm convinced at this point it has to do with ME. I feel so alone. So so alone. I do have frequent suicidal thoughts, and I truly am thinking this time around of doing it. It's not like I would matter any way. But I do have some sliver of hope remaining; hence why I'm posting this. I hope someone can pull me out of this thinking. It's draining my soul. ","1"
"Idk why but it seemed that for a little while there things were going great. I had a girlfriend who seemed like she cared, everything was going great at school, people talked to me, things were good. But it seems like lately nobody cares, nobody talks to me, I dont have a girlfriend anymore and shes basically thrown me in the lowest part of the friend zone. Then other people lead me on to think that they like me and then basically act like they cant stand me. The only things keeping me going is my desire to join the army and the fact that I have both of my parents and they seem relatively happy. Idk why I felt like saying this, anything to even attempt to make me feel better would be absolutely to god fantastic.","1"

"Hi.I don't have any friends i can talk to and the only  one i do have is messed up too and i dont want to keep talking to her about how miserable i am because she's miserable too and idk if its healthy. And when i do vent some problems to her she comes off a bit insensitive because shes dealing with things too. But anyways. Every day is hard. I feel like im whining because i feel like i dont want to do anthing but just stay in bed and sleep or watch netflix. Theres so many things going on in my head that it feels suffocating and the only way i can function is if i ignore it. But its always there in there background. I always want to cry but i can never actually cry. I feel like no one likes me. Its hard to focus and i just feel so overwhelmed and sad everyday. And hollow but at the same time full. Its like my mind is racing so much it becomes numb. I dont have anyone in my family i can trust because they got mad at me for a mistake and have ignored me for a whole year and while i miss them its like i woke up and now see how horrible they actually are because of how theyre treating me. Only my mom really talks to me but shes messed up too. When i was living with her i had a mental breakdown to the point where i was rocking back and forth like a child. And thank god i had my miserable friend to help me get out for the day. It sucks because im in uni so im far away from everyone and im just alone. I have a teacher i have told some of my problems to but i feel like i annoy him because of how many times ive come to him and idk i feel like he thinks im really annoying especially because he never checked up on me on how i was doing after i called him when i had my mental breakdown and the last time i went to see him he kind of ignored me til i went up to him and even then he didnt ask how i was but idk its not his job to ask anyways so its my fault for getting upset at him not asking. Hes like the only one in the school that knows im kind of messed up. He told me his class teaching schedule but idk i feel like a nusiance so i dont go visit him. And sometimes i do want to go see him because often times i dont feel like a tangible human being. I feel so lost and alone and airy that i just idk. And i often get sucked into deep sad holes where i feel like life would be okay if i just died. I already called the school therapist but they wont see me til december, i told my teacher that but he said keep calling them, but they keep saying not til december. And i know hes going through stuff too so hes busy. I just. Want someone to hold me and who genuinely cares because right now i dont have anyone. I just. Idk. ","1"
"Anyone else do this, where you come up with ways to punish yourself for an imagined fuck-up?

"First and foremost I'd like to thank people that will pay me some attention (or not) and apologize in advance for possible mistakes, as English is not my first language.I feel like I need to get this off my chest, hopefully get some advice or words of help, as my parents don't want to listen to me, thinking that I'm just being lazy. But every time when I try to talk and get deeper I get ignored.I'm 20 y.o., currently live in Moscow, Russia & study in a linguistic university. I live with my mother, she broke up with my father 10 years ago.I have no idea when it started, there's no certain point where my life started collapsing, I believe it has been getting worse gradually. I started feeling completely miserable, hopeless, exhausted; I saw no point in life, no bright future for me. I completely lost my self-confidience. I had no goals, I didn't know who I am and whom I wanted to be. I had no hobby, I had no idea, what makes me happy.And you think that it couldn't get worse, you're wrong. In the beginning I felt ill mentally. But it got worse. I got ill not just mentally, but physically. I feel exhausted all the time, I have no energy. It seems like I have lack of sleeping, but regardless of how many time I was sleeping, I feel tired. If there's no university, I could sleep 14-16 hours per day.What even worse, I got situation out of control. I gained weight, got addiction to cigarettes (thank god I hate alcohol), I spend time  wasting it. I feel like I'm slowly dying. And there's nothing I can do about it.Now I'm not just complaining. This desease abuses me for 2 years. I tried to go to gym, eat healthy food and all of that. But I couldn't get the job done. I had no energy to do that every day. And after each failure I got even more depressed.Someone'll probably say to put a smile on my face, forget about all that shit because time cures all things. But for me it's not. I panic.

"(I posted this on the depression sub too but I thought it'd be more likely to get any sort of feedback here I feel bad about posting it at all but like the title says I don't know what to do)I genuinely want help, recently my only irl friend linked me this subreddit and told me maybe I should read through a little of it or post something. I've had depression, anxiety, and ptsd for years now and I've been known to always be trying my best with things I've been known to be a good person but it's all so hard. my best and only real friend has been trying to help me more with my mental illness lately and has been trying to talk to me about it all I want to explain but I don't know how to explain it exactly. more so recently I've just felt completely dead, it feels like literally and figuratively nothing ever matters like getting up and eating and all that selfcare going to school especially I just want to sleep sleep and sleep. now all of this isn't new to me or anything but it feels like I'm sinking lower than I ever have, I don't even want to play games anymore.. I only enjoy playing league of legends with one other person at least because otherwise it all just feels so empty, I can't play any other online game alone at least not for long before I just want to go to bed or cry, I try to watch Netflix shows or anime and I can only watch an episode or two without the same feelings setting in. I have no real support system I've done everything mostly alone and I don't know if I'm breaking down more often and harder lately because of that or what. I'm on medication and I do have some counseling which I enjoy talking to my counsellor but I don't think it's frequent enough. I feel like a problem to my parents and my only friend I feel like a problem to anyone I interact with.. I tried to make my parents happy by going back to school but nobody told me they were proud nobody told me I was doing a good job they didn't say anything and I didn't expect it but it still hurts. ive been staying mostly in bed for almost 3 weeks now, I don't know what to do anymore.

"Someone the other day suggested that my brain chemistry is messed up, let me list the symptoms i explained to them so ya'll have an idea of why he suggested that. So first off i'm 13 years old, about a month ago i stopped taking my anti-depressant medication (zoloft) which helped me with my anxiety. They were about 50 mg and in total i token about 10 to 20 of them, about once a day. From what i remembered i took about 8-10 of them every single day in the span of a week and a half or so, (not to sure). It didn't really help me at all so I stopped taking them for a month. During the time span of a month I noticed a lot of things changing in my life. First off I stopped enjoying the one thing I loved which was music. Then after that I stopped enjoying another thing i loved which was video games. Because of this I was sad and crying everyday wanting my love of my hobbies back. So I went back taking zoloft for a while. While i was taking zoloft I noticed something strange, I was not feeling any emotion for quite sometime. I felt tired and emotionless and then my liking of video games came back but I only really played minecraft since that was a game that I typically played when I was bored or wanting to kill time. After taking those pills for a while I finished the whole bottle, and here is where my problem comes in. For the past couple of weeks all I have been feeling is a sense of happiness and me smiling, but the thing is that there is no effect which causes me to do so. I've never felt sad or felt any other emotion despite me typically going through things day to day which i'll get sad from before. And also with that since i don't find anything enjoyable I just feel emotionless and hopeless in the sense that i'm bored all the time yet happy 24/7. Should I go see a specialist or a doctor? I'm not totally sure what to do... Is this a bad thing or a good thing? Someone else also suggested that this might also be a ""hormone imbalance"". Please help.","1"

He pays bills and helps my dad with rent, but is left with little money for savings (after weed and alcohol, which is unlikely to be given up seeing that my dad is an alcoholic stoner as well, hence the unhealthy environment). I'm worried about his mental health. It's incredibly saddening to see him discouraged and unmotivated to improve his situation. He comes home from work every day and drinks beer/smokes in the garage (not a bad thing, but seems sad alone on a daily basis). If his girlfriend is working, he's sleeping. He's 21. I want to see him out having fun and experiencing life. I know shit is tough for everyone around that age but he is so isolated and has expressed that he feels years behind his peers for dropping out, but still doesn't go back to school.Retrospectively he has been showing signs of depression since high school which have gone unnoticed by my parents. I've brought this up to my mom and she says he can't afford treatment anyway, and that she 'can't do it for him'. Is there anyone who's been in a similar situation who can offer some advice? Is there anything I can do to help? I know what he needs but I also know that he's an adult, not to mention he doesn't listen to what I say anyway. I love him and can't stand to see him beat down like this. I want him to be happy. I don't know what else to say. He's just been on my mind and I want to help. ","1"

"I'm no longer crying everyday or having suicidal thoughts.  I'm so glad that I feel better than before but I'm struggling to keep up with school work and other responsibilities. I'm 17 and have been depressed and anxious for most of my teen years. I never learned how to be organised or how to motivate myself. I want to know how to stick to a routine even though I feel tired and don't want to do anything. I want to be productive, I know that being productive will help my recovery and I know I'll feel happy and accomplished after I've done things but I just don't do things. I spend most of my free time in my bed looking at reddit or YouTube on my phone. I don't even enjoy procrastinating but it takes less effort than studying or hobbies and I always choose the easy option. Is this a medication problem or is this something I need to work on myself? I'm finding it difficult to commit to my tasks given in therapy and I don't think I'm functional enough to keep up with school and get my A Levels. I've been on Prozac 20mg 3 months now and I have noticed have noticed a huge difference. The majority of the time now I feel neutral and 'okay' but I still have problems with concentrating and feeling tired. Any advice?","1"
"Firstly this is nothing compared to what Ive read. And I apologise for anything that you may seem unnecessary or that angers you. Ok so Im extremely anti-social I rather be by self meet new people online. And go out to do what I have to and get back home with minimal contact, talking and what not. Anyway so my 18th is in a few weeks and Ive only hanged around with this group of people from the start of this year as I didnt like the previous group. And started to be completely dickheads to me. I talked to one of them before adding a plan to the group chat. And while I was doing to I was having a panic attack, and started thinking are they going to come, if they do how many, what food should I buy. Ive never had anyone over since I started high school 7-12 as I never really connected with anyone. And I was fine with it as I focused on my education and my physical well-being as much as I could. So I added this plan to the group and I just lost it. Because why should they come I dont do anything with them, I never say anything in the chat as Im afraid of saying something stupid and Ive had this happen before, well about 10 other times when I thought I could tell this guy what ever and he screenshots it posts it to other chats, websites and others. I know this is stupid and I should be here typing this now. But who is there? My parents sure but I dont say much about what Im dealing with. My personal life is only to me and no one else really knows. Well apart from this I guess. I always try to be positive, happy when I can but the last month has just hurt me, anyway. And again this is nothing compared to what Ive read and this is stupid post in how im currently thinking. ","1"
"I'm here today because I am tired. Tired of being alive. I've self-harmed myself in the past. I suffer from anxiety and depression that's been going on for years, since High school. I'm 33 now. I live with my gf and 5 year old son. I had a rough childhood, at home and school. I cannot see how my loved ones would benefit from me being alive. My gf thinks my suicidal thoughts are just a tactic to make her feel sorry for me, But I am beyond that. my first thought every morning is one of dread. Dread for waking up again and having to do ""life"" another damn day.  I've thought of driving over to the cliffs. Thought of just running of a road. many things. Tired, just so tired...","1"
"I am diagnosed with Major Depression. But, it is usually triggered by life events. Once I'm down, it can be a long slog... I guess that's what makes it depression, and not just a bad mood related to events.... The depression extends pretty far past the triggering event.Let me just start by saying that my wife knew this when we got married. I had informed her about my diagnosis and what that meant, and essentially what I did and didn't expect from a partner. What she claimed, then, to offer, was comfort. She promised that when I was down, as long as I didn't mistreat her, she would do her best to comfort me. There were even times where this alone worked, but at the very least it helped when she was understanding.However, things took an irrevocable turn, during this last event. First, it was triggered by my having to take a job I find soul-sucking, in order to pay our marital debts. We took these out together, yet she never has helped with them, despite being more educated than me, and at times having better employment. I took this job to keep up with all of it, and I told her I needed help, that it was really sinking my mental state. Not only did she not help, she started disappearing at night.I know it's hard to help someone with depression, but she works, and she could've put some money into one of the loans to give me some breathing room. It's come out in the divorce that she had a lot more money socked away that she let on, which hurts more that I know it was a choice to let me suffer. These nights out became frequent enough that it occurred to me that it was an affair. I couldn't prove it, but I knew it. I started catching her about lies, concerning where she was going. She told me she was going to a friend's house for a party. I walked past and the lights were out. She tried to say they were watching a movie. Another time, I saw her with the guy getting pizza, and she said he was just walking her home. She would use my computer, and one day she left the messenger window open, and I saw all the correspondence, dating back months. They were seeing each other daily. Then, she told me she was going out and taking the car. So I walked by the guy's house and it was out front. So I texted her a picture of the car, and asked her if she cared to explain. Then I revealed that I knew about the correspondence.She tried to say it was abusive to look through the messenger, and it's hard to excuse myself, except that she was behaving suspiciously and I had to know for sure. In three years, I had never done anything so invasive before, despite her regularly reading my texts and emails and what have you. I felt I was being transparent, even though I thought it was wrong... but I guess this is how I justify it.... If I had to be transparent, then so did she.In any case, what really hurts, is that instead of trying to be there for me or comfort me through any of what I was going through, she started up an affair. There was a point early in the affair where I asked her for a divorce, but she refused, saying she thought we could work on it. It's clear now that she just wanted me to keep paying for things. I can't understand how she changed so much. I know this depression related more to something she was doing and something I was asking her to change.... I didn't think that was unfair, and I didn't think she would go and have an affair over it. It feels like a level of sadistic behavior I don't have in my heart to do to others. Nor would I ever be able to deal with the guilt of having a protracted affair. I cheated on an ex-girlfriend once, many years ago. I told her the next day, and broke it off. I didn't lead her on, or try to make her think we could work out our problems. I felt, if I had gone to that level, it was clearly broken enough to end it. I wish my ex-wife could've done the same. I wish she would have just ended it with me, instead of dragging me through the mud.We're just starting the divorce, so she may drag me through yet more mud. I've gotten smarter, and I think I'm protected from a lot of what she could do, because of the marital misconduct... but man, I'm in a low spot.","1"
"I started taking Prozac a little while ago, and it's been long enough that I should have seen an effect. I told my mom ""I don't think it's working. You should probably stop wasting money on this stuff"" She replied with ""I can definitely see a difference. An hour ago you just walked up to your sister and gave her a hug. You haven't done that since she was 3""I wanted to cry right there because the feels of knowing that I'm finally getting better we're too muchJust wanted to post this so other people saw and realize that it does get better","1"
"This is gonna be long but I really hope someone can read this all the way through and help me. I really need someone to give me helpful advice for once in my life, so here I go.Last year after recently turning 19 my car broke down, for good. I had 3,000 dollars in savings my grandma owed me as she spent it all before I could even touch it. I needed a new car, and she felt bad having spent all the money I saved so she gathered it back up and after MONTHS of asking her for a ride to look at cars she finally took me (and my mom) to look at cars. I wanted to use it as a down payment on a used car, around the 2010 and under range, which was completely do-able for me considering my income at the time. They took me to 4 used car lots, 3 being used rentals, as opposed to a normal used car lot. I found a couple cars I liked but my mom and grandma kept dismissing every one I picked. One in particular was a 2008 Lexus, and while I don't remember the exact price, it was really good. They refused to let me buy it because it didn't have warranty. I explained that it was used so that's kind of a given but they didn't let me buy it. I would have owned that car today as I type this if I had gotten it. So being that I found very few cars I liked, instead of taking me to the usual used car lot they took me straight to the new car lots. We looked at new cars all day even after I found very little interest in anything other than a used civic. Seeing I liked the civic they took me to Honda. The whole time I was against it, and I stated several times that the cars were indeed nice, but out of my range. I didn't want to be here, but ""it doesn't hurt to look"". I wanted to look at used cars but they made it very clear that wasn't gonna happen. Frustrated, I looked for something I could possibly afford. While looking, my mom pointed our a very attractive bright green civic, it had a nice interior, and even a sun roof. At this point my grandma grabbed a salesperson who kept pushing me to drive it even though I made it clear I was not interested. I wanted him to stop bothering me about it so I drove it, and it was very nice,  it drove exactly like my old car but like butter, it was so much smoother and faster. I honestly really enjoyed it. So my mom and grandma told the salesman I liked it.(genius, I know) so one thing led to another and we were waiting and haggling for hours over a car I didn't really want to pay for. I asked if we could keep looking and they refused to take me anywhere else. We got a price and I turned and told them, ""this is way over my budget, I don't know about this."" They egged me on saying it's ok and it wasn't that expensive. At this point I was so worn out and tired of arguing I gave in and before I gave my final answer I looked both my mother and grandmother in the  eyes and asked them, ""Is this smart? I do like this car but I really don't feel like I can afford it. You guys make it seem like it won't be so bad, so should I get it? ""all I got was ""I dunno, it's up to you."" Frustrated and worn out, I co-signed the contract with my mom under the conditions that she get to drive the car too, as she didnt have a car, which was not a problem as I would be done anything I could for my mom. I went home with a new car, finally getting to drive again after months and months of not having a car,  it was exhilarating, it was pretty cool. 19 and here I was with a car that had a measly 7 miles on it, and my family was backing it up telling me how proud they were and how smart I was. I felt good. Then shit hit the fan and I lost my job. My mom has lupas and according to her she's incapable of working, although she gets around pretty fine and still cleans and does yard work with no problems. She lives off credit cards and social security with mainly my grandma supporting both of us. Money was tight but her name was on the car so she made the payments so her credit wouldnt get fucked, as she literally lives off of credit cards. 6 stressful months pass and I FINALLY land a job, and at the railroad! I was ecstatic! I've been here for 8 months now and I've been making 13 an hour, when I got my first paycheck I couldn't believe how much I was earning! Now I realize I don't make shit. I make enough for insurance($400), my car payment ($400) and gas. What little I have left over I use for food. thought by now my problems would be over but they've gotten worse. My mom and grandma threaten me daily about kicking me out and get mad at me for eating their food or cooking or doing anything really. Literally all I do is work and sleep and what little free time I do have I spend running errands or doing chores. Any time I have to sit and relax they come to me and bitch and complain about me generally existing and taking up space. ""Get your head outta your ass!"" ""Your a fucking ungrateful asshole!"" ""You don't care about anyone but yourself!""These are daily things I hear. They've even been turning my friends against me and telling them lies about me behind my back. I've been losing my best friend and I love him more than anyone else on this planet. Every morning i wonder if im gonna get to eat. Every night i wonder if ill have somewhere to sleep. Every day at work I worry about my stuff being thrown out or destroyed. This all coming from my family. Who I thought loved me. Who I thought had the best intentions for me. But now I'm just some disgusting useless waste of space and money who needs to give them money or die in a hole. I understand I owe my mom money but I really don't make too much and I'm barley scraping by. I've been trying my best every day and it's still not good enough. Im 20 years old now and probably should be living on my own but they put me into this situation. They made me look at new cars. They pointed out the car. They grabbed the salesman and talked to him they refused to let me look elsewhere. Yet I lose my job due to unfortunate circumstance and now I'M at fault? Who tells a 19 year old kid to buy a brand new car for 26,000 dollars on a 10 dollar an hour wage? I thought I could trust them but I really can only blame myself for not doing the research and just assuming instead that my family had my back. I now know you really can't trust anyone. My mom only picked out the car because SHE liked it. She took me to a new car lot because SHE wanted to look. All she does is get high on pills all day and do house chores. I work my ass off and yet im the lazy useless asshole. They always told me I have to take care of them for all the shit they've done to take care of me over the years, which now in hindsight doesn't make sense. If it was such a big deal to take care of me why have me? My mom had many people willing to pay for an abortion but she refused. She chose to have me, yet somehow I owe her because of that decision. I've been growing more emotionally detached from them every day and now I'm honestly just starting to hate them. Growing up I had a babysitter who beat me until I pissed myself daily. I cried myself to sleep every night wishing my mom and grandma could believe me and save me but they didn't. My dad was never really there and my mom always worked so growing up I literally just had myself. I never had family there and I never had anyone to teach me anything. I feel like I've honestly never had family and it hurts me to the core that these people would treat me this way after I've been through rough times especially after they weren't there for me in the past. I feel like my whole life I've just been a leech, a burden on everyone I encounter. I've been losing weight and only eating whatever measly amounts of food I can afford or get handed. I've been hella stressed and sad and mad every day and it's been putting stress on my relationship with my girlfriend. Every day I get anxiety knowing that I have to return to my house at some point and get yelled at for some random thing they decided to be mad at that day. I've been contemplating driving as far away as possible and dumping my car somewhere so I can run away on foot somewhere, anywhere really. Or just buying a gun off the street and blowing my brains out. Something. Anything just to get away. Every day I'm closer to breaking and I don't know how to get out of this situation.I honestly just want somewhere I can take a shit and eat food and sleep without someone complaining about me being there. I just wanna be able to support myself so I can live a healthy life. I don't need a Ferrari or an Xbox one or a 50 inch tv. I just want to come home after a long day of work, take my boots off, play with my pets and spend time with my girlfriend. Eat a home cooked dinner. Go outside and relax and take in the fresh air. I just want a simple life  where I don't have to bother anyone ever again. I owe my mom 6 months worth of car payments and my car is too expensive for me to afford a place. Jobs are scarce out here and I don't know of any trades that are quick and cheap to get into. I could just not pay my car but if my credits fucked then I can't get my own place. It seems like no matter what I do I'm fucked. I just want someone who can tell me the right thing to do. Someone who can give me advice that won't fuck up my life. I've never had that person. Maybe I won't find them scouring the internet but it's worth a shot.  Please, someone help me. I'm begging you. Pm me, reply to this tgread, idc. Please, I pray everyday for this to end and I'm on the edge of my sanity. If anyone out there has a heart, please tell me what to do. Because I really don't know anymore. ","1"
"I just feel so depressed. I don't really know how to explain this feeling but just a gush of sadness and not really knowing what to do with my existence.

"I have never felt as depressed as I do right now.Last night, I got busted for weed at a party.I'm a captain on my football team and it means everything to me. I preach sacrifice and character to all my teammates and here I am a fucking idiot who was selfish for one night and ruined everything. I know I'm going to be suspended from sports for 30 days and miss the rest of my senior season. I feel like I've let everyone on the team down, my family down, and my parents down. I can't talk to my mother because I don't want her pity or trying to make me feel better. I hate myself.I took down all of the photos I have of football in my room, I can't even bear to look at it. I hate myself every second of the day because of how I let everyone down. I've sacrificed my body for the team all season, playing with a concussion, torn tendons and broken fingers, and now I'm so afraid no one on the team will want to see me. I'm afraid that I everything I gave up was for nothing now. I'm so afraid that my coaches and my parents will never be able to look at me the same or take pride in me.I'm so afraid that I won't be able to get into college because of this. I feel like everything is pointless right now and I've ruined everything I've worked for because of one selfish night. I don't know what I came to this sub to hear or be told but I just don't know who to go to and I just had to say this. I can't stand to be around myself. ","1"
"Created an account for this. I've been fantasizing about being dead more lately, and I want to talk about it with my boyfriend of 5 years/friends/family. But I don't know how much good that will do or how to bring it up without them panicking, and once the panic washes over, resenting me for being a burden. I can't really afford therapy, and I haven't really been comfortable in the few sessions I've had in the past. About two years ago when things were sunnier, I told my bf and my sister that I wanted to kill myself in high school. I know all of the online ""what to do if you have depression"" blogs say to reach out to loved ones, but I don't want to be the person who cried wolf here or who just stresses everyone out. How do you ""get help"" without weighing other people down?","1"
"Just like the title but ill explain a little more in depth. So my depression comes in super strong waves. Most days my feelings are pretty neutral and im fine but when my depression sets in it's literally crippling. I dont want to do anything i got to force myself to go out and when i do that my anixity goes into a crazy overdrive that eventually prevents me from doing anything. Ironically normally im the person who anit afraid to be a fool but i become such a different person when the feeling sets in i hate it and dont wanna be around anyone or anything. It's like im blank faced in person but on the inside im trying to prevent a complete meltdown that feels like it could happen any second.","1"

"I'm here cause i feel like im literally out of options and I considered suicide this morning. I know suicide is a permanent answer to something temporary but hear my story and offer me advice.So as most depression story goes it starts with a girl, it's a long one so buckle up. I've known her since middle school a friendship that has lasted to now when we are both 32. When I first met her I fell in love, could of been hormones but either way I was infatuated with her. She turned me down of course but we lived near each other and became close friends. She developed feelings for me  but didn't act on them in time, I moved away.Fast forward to highschool we get reacquainted thru my next door neighbor and then best freind, saying he just met the most amazing girl. Asked if he was going to date her he said no just that She was cool. And when I found out who he was talking about he was right. She is an amazing person who anyone would fall for. After being reacquainted we start doing what most teenagers do we mess around never had sex but other things making out etc, we start dating. It was going great till one day she is super upset and after we were physical she breaks up with me. Confused I turn to my best freind that night. He confesses he has been messing around and had sex with her behind my back. That friendship ended then but for some reason I eventually forgave her. They end up dating after that and when highschool was over I thought we could still be freinds.So now we are out of highschool I still maintained some contact with her hoping that I may get another chance with her. I find out they broken up and I reach out, find out she started dating a mutual friends brother and that she joined the military. On new years  of 2004 I find out she marries this guy she had know. For 3 months cause she got orders to Japan and didn't want to go alone. I'm crushed for some reason I always thought we would get back together and pick up where we left off. We fight and argue and cry and yell. Lots of alcohol insued and we part ways. 6 years pass I had joined and been in the military for a while had a few girlfriends and even at one point a fiance that I screwed up. While deployed I get messaged by her out of the blue. We catch up she has a son now and is divorced. She is in another relationship with a guy for a couple years now and happy with it but her mother is dying of cancer. She turned to me for support and of course I did the best I could being deployed. When i come back I burn almost all my leave going to her and helping her. Being there for her and just trying to be a good freind mostly because her boy freind is deployed. We go out one night and just get plastered cause she wanted to. We are both completely drunk and end up kissing and making out eventually leading to sex in a bar bathroom. The next morning I asked if we had sex last night and we both pieced the night back together and ended up with the definite yes. She claims it was a mistake and I agree and we part ways.Now here is where I think I completely messed up, I had been dating another girl and it was going great. But then she calls me up one night. She and I talk her mother has passed away now and she couldn't handle her relationship anymore. She ended her 6 year relationship and wanted to do something fun. She asks me to go on a cruise with her and I said sure. Then she asks if we were going to go as friends or more than Friends. I say friends and she quickly back tracks and cancels plans. It's at this point looking back I may have screwed any chance of a relationship with her.Few years later still friends but now she is in another relationship. She didn't tell me about him. She invited me to go to Orlando studios before I get shipped overseas to japan. A mutual freind of ours was going and her cousin so I thought ok cool. What she didn't tell me was her new boy freind would be going. It was awkward and didn't really enjoy my time. Our mutual freind hated her new boyfriend and they were all fighting the entire time. He was a jackass and was super cocky. I didn't like him either but for an additional reason, he got to be with her and not me.2015 now I'm in Japan and enjoying my time, still pining for her so I don't date around as much thinking I may have a shot in the future with her. She comes to visit me in Japan, she is single now after all so I think this is it. And I was mistaken, at this point I had been freindzoned and I didn't even know it. I thought it was obvious I had feelings for her and that I wanted more than a freindship. It was awkward the last few days she was there.2017 now I'm getting out of the military and she linked me with a freind of hers to get a job. She then tells me I should move to where she lives. I know no one else there and is a million miles from anyone besides her. She says I can move in with her I tell her I think it will be awkward she doesn't think so. So I take it as a sign there is renewed hope I move everything to this new city away from everything and any help if I may need it. My finds are lacking but I got this new job that requires alot travel so it should work out in like a year.Well if you made it this far I'm sure you know what happens next. We are living together having fun each day together. We see each other every day, I feel like we had grown very close. I confess my renewed feelings to her and she turns me down. She says that she has thought about it and we would be great together but she dosent want to hurt me if things don't work out. She claims she has cheated on ever boy freind she has had. And if we were going out she knows that I would forgive her if that happened to me and couldn't stand the fact that I would love her more than she could love me. She doesn't want to be hated by me and to never talk to her again. I leave for a week for business and this week I come back and find out she has a boyfreind. She never told me I found out thru her son. Now I'm living in her house trying to avoid her because everyone I look at her or hear her voice I feel like I was just not good enough I will never be good enough. I feel so angry at myself for having feelings for her and angry with her that she could just get a boy freind after a week of me pouring my heart to her.I know the answer is to leave but I have no where to go. I don't have enough money to rent a place I have a house loan going so I can try to buy a place but still won't be out of here for another month at the soonest. And I have a dog that she had been looking after while I'm on my business trips. I don't have any friends here other than her I don't have any family that is close that I can stay with. I'm 32 and feel like a 17 year-old emotional teenager. I woke up this morning and thought I have no outs. I either give up my dog live on the streets till I get a house or suffer for another month or two. I contemplated suicide for the first time since my fiance left me. A permanent answer to a temporary problem but it seems so much more enticing than suffering for a few more months. I feel like I'm getting too old to make another relationship as close as what I would have with her, and if I do I'll be too old to have kids. I feel like I wasted so much time and effort on a fruitless love. Meeting people when you have no friends or a job you regularly go to makes it so much harder. I just don't know what to do I feel like I have no options. ","1"
" guys I have been battling major depression since my preteens and have been on mood stabilizers and antidepressants ever since. I selfharmed for two years and when I stopped I started drinking excessively (in a specific year of high school which was extremely difficult for me).I have done and experienced many things which I have never been able to verbalise to anyone- not even the therapist I used to see and I trusted that man more than anyone else on earth.The things I have done I always felt ashamed about but until I started the road to recovery from depression. This was when I realised that these things have actually been done to me...There are many nights when I can't fall asleep, rolling around with extreme anxiety and flashbacks to certain events. They are in no specific order, they just jump from one memory to another and it's consuming my brain. Sometimes when I am enjoying myself these flashbacks occur in full swing and they occur at the most random times when I am doing something completely unrelated.I feel filthy Saddened And lonelyI can't talk to anyone and I DO NOT have money for a therapist- this is why I started posting my problems online...So, do you thing I have PTS or PTSD? What alternative methods are there for solving this problem which does not require a therapist? (I am on meds and mentally stable af btw)","1"

I selfharmed for two years and when I stopped I started drinking excessively (in a specific year of high school which was extremely difficult for me).I have done and experienced many things which I have never been able to verbalise to anyone- not even the therapist I used to see and I trusted that man more than anyone else on earth.The things I have done I always felt ashamed about but until I started the road to recovery from depression. This was when I realised that these things have actually been done to me...There are many nights when I can't fall asleep, rolling around with extreme anxiety and flashbacks to certain events. They are in no specific order, they just jump from one memory to another and it's consuming my brain. Sometimes when I am enjoying myself these flashbacks occur in full swing and they occur at the most random times when I am doing something completely unrelated.I feel filthy Saddened And lonelyI can't talk to anyone and I DO NOT have money for a therapist- this is why I started posting my problems online...So, do you thing I have PTS or PTSD? What alternative methods are there for solving this problem which does not require a therapist? (I am on meds and mentally stable af btw)","1"
"Im a 28 year old female.. I know that I have anxiety, but now Im pretty sure Im depressed as well. I have a good career, but I was never happy. I went back to school this year and I was happy for a bit and now Im even worse than I was before I went back to school, Im thinking bc of the increased stress. Im never happy. I never have a break from stress bc Im in a demanding major plus am taking an extra class on the side that I was deficient in to get into my college. I also work part time at my same job I was at. I cry everyday. Im a ball of anxiety. I have good grades, but at what cost? I try talking to my family and friends but all they say is youre smart. Youll do it  Im in counseling and thats the only place I feel better bc my counselor is amazing. She makes me feel like despite my anxiety (and now depression) I am a good person. My mom judges me for it, but I dont think thats her fault bc her mom was depressed and anxious and she didnt have a good life growing up. I feel like Ill never be happy. Im chasing something thatll never come. I see other people that are in school and theyre happy. They have fun still. Im so stuck in the mindset that I need to be perfect that I cant even pretend to be happy anymore. I feel like people are constantly judging me and Im going to die with these insecurities and unhappiness. All I want is to be happy and my old self again. Please help me. Sorry for rambling. ","1"
"I'm on a burner since this story would connect way to well with my other account. Basically, about a month ago, I had just a complete depressive episode. I Couldn't get out of bed, I didn't want to eat, and I just didn't see he point of living. I've been spending my days trying to get better, to some success, but I keep getting pulled back because of class work I'm missing (my major is very demanding) WhetherI take less classes, or I take the semester off, I get my scholarship revoked. I'm not entirely sure what to do. I've always been an A student, but I can't do school work in general without feeling like completele turd afterwards. Has anyone gone through this? Can anyone offer any advice as to what to do?  ","1"
"Dear reddit,It was nearly 3 years ago that I crashed into this depression. I had slumps before this episode, but nothing like this, where I have completely shut down emotionally, intellectually, and in terms of my behaviour. It is currently as bad as it ever was. I think that's because the program I have been doing over the past 10 months to try and get better has not worked and I really wanted it to. I shall likely continue with certain parts of it, though, like meditation. Can I ask anyone what they would recommend for a feelings journal? It is really difficult for me to identify what I'm feeling at the moment, so when I have tried a feelings journal over the past couple of weeks, I have simply sat with myself and tried to go into my body and draw out what I'm feeling. I have to be really specific in what I write, as I can't clearly label any feelings I have. I've done this for about 45 minutes each time and had some success in peeling back a few layers - I could almost feel sadness when I did this. However, I am not journalling my thoughts along with my feelings and some recommend that you journal thoughts and feelings together. What does anyone think?Also, what does anyone recommend in terms of diet? I don't know much about cooking and I tend to cook the same meals on rotation. I don't know anything about the different diets people recommend; when I've read this information, I've just felt overwhelmed with all the different information. As such, can anyone advise in a really basic and specific way about eating better and how to cook, etc.","1"
"My dad said ""They can't be that bad, athletes take them all the time. Even the doctor said so."" The doctor never said that and my dad is delusional. I read him the difference between corticosteroids vs anabolic steroids and he repeated over and over that's not what the doctor said not what the doctor said. My mom and I are both very sick. I tend to her when I'm well, but I have a lot of symptoms of ms. I have no brain lesions, and no diagnosis. I live with my parents because I am sick, but have no one to turn to. ","1"
"I've just started to get depression. Well that's what I think it is? I'm starting to question everything I love. My wife and family it all started 3 weeks ago out of the blue I woke up on morning with this weird feeling in my stomach like I was on a roller coaster.The night before my wife, she went out with some drinks with some coworkers and she had a little to much to drink and had to be helped inside our house. Ever since then I've been thinking negative. Like she had cheated on me or she's talking to on of her coworkers. I like to think I have always been a emotionally strong person. But ever since that night i think she cheated on me. And I can't get it out of my head. I'm constantly thinking about it and question everything she does. The stuff I think won't go away I think about how she cheated on me and with who and I cry almost everyday. Then it got deeper i have gone fond of watching death. I've never had this before but something about watching people die is entertaining to me.Mental health runs in my family so I get extra scared. My brother had deep mental illness. I think I have depression or something mental going on. I'm not motivated I'm crying constantly. I've tried talking to my wife about everything but she gets depressed also when I bring it up. And I have to put my feeling aside and tell her I'm alright and I feel better so she can feel better. After having my kids I lost all contact with my friends. They were not the type of people I wanted to hang out with they did drugs and drink all the time. I feel so lonely and afraid that this illness is going to evolve to something bigger like taking my own life.Thank you for your time,and just typing this feels good like in getting something off my chest.","1"
"i probably wont kill myself but i really want to die. i dont like living anymore... its been a long time since i have. im so done. i feel like im constantly burned out but everything keeps asking of me. life,...society,.....my own dreams and ambitions....there all to much for someone like me. the only one who can reach me is a lover. someone who can cuddle with me and wisper words of love into my ear while loving me through my pain. friends or family cant really get that close without it seeming weird. but it will never happen anyway because im way too toxic. Im have more mental ill nesses than depression which makes reaching my goals more out of reach. i dont need a ""keep trying"" or a ""DONT GIVE UP MATE"". believe me ive tried everything you can think of ""at least"" two times over. im burned out and for all my years i have fought the hardest to be who i am. little did i know i was just a puppet in knights armor. and now that the war for my soul has broken all my bones  the only thing that remains is my dangling limbs swinging about from the puppet strings guided by the puppet master who is relentlessly ever so demanding.","1"
"Hi All,23 years old and Student in the UK. Ive suffered a lot with anxiety and depression for many years now. Over the summer it got too much I tried to overdose on anti-anxiety meds; unfortunately, it wasnt enough to kill me. This attempt on depriving my life from myself was because of a false allegation that occurred last year on campus.Two girls who I was quite good friends with at the time accused me of raping both in the same night and in the same bed. I was suspended from campus and the police were involved. The girls both made a statement to the university, the police got involved and they interviewed the two girls and the refused to comment on the statement they gave, which immediately makes you think that they were lying (which they were). The Uni decided that both parties were telling the truth and that it wasnt a malicious allegation towards me. Since returning for my second year at Uni, Ive had more lies from these two girls which forced me to move Uni halls to avoid contact with them. Ive had no help from the Uni regarding this being considered further. Because of this disappointment its effected my studies ruined a relationship with someone who I cared about a lot. I fear walking around on campus on my own and feel restricted to my bedroom. This has put a lot of strain on me Ive started to self-harm every day thoughts about ending my life just to escape from the misery Im going through. I dont know what else to do as everything I try just seems to fuck up. I want to die... im getting help but I feel its too late.Has anyone ever had this happen to them? What next steps would you recommend as I feel Im running out of time... this slowly killing me and soon it will be too late. Thanks for taking the time to read this. I love you all.","1"

"Hello Everybody,So, this is very hard for me to write and post. I have had depression most of my life and normally it came and would taper off a bit. To help cope I took up exercising and trying to eat healthier. I also made it a point to take St. John's Wart to help stave off the horrible panic attacks.However, recently due to a combination of moving and deaths in the family I have felt worse and the panic attacks have gotten worse. I tried doing therapy but to be honest it didn't help and made me feel worse. I am afraid to go on serious anti-depressants such as Zoloft for fear of the side effects.I just need some advice if there are there natural remedies or something that can help? Thank you everyone.","1"

"hello. i could tell you my name, but this is not about me, but about YOU. if youve been dealing with depression lately or for your whole life, im pretty sure youre a cool person, just like me. that may sound ambiguous but dont worry. my only pourpose in doing this is reaching out a hand for anyone who thinks may need it. why? because I WANT TO. also, you may think it doesnt, but sometimes telling someone else (not just anyone) your problems may help a lot. sometimes what you need is a different point of view and all the shit will be gone before you know it, leaving you with only what YOU want in your mind at any given time. contact me at cobianmateo@gmail.com and we can find the easiest way to talk (or the one you feel most comfortable with).

"I dont think this is NSFW, but may have triggering language..I really figured I wouldnt make it to 40.  My birthday is coming up in 6 weeks, and it is weird to think that Ive survived almost 4 decades.  Through the abuse, violence, assaults, rapes, chronic pain, depression and anxiety, Im still here.  I guess that is an achievement.  The only worthwhile thing Ive ever done is have a baby.  Im a shit mother, and its my fault that he is almost 20 and doesnt have his diploma or GED.. but at least I contributed a life that might amount to something.  I did my biological duty, hes an adult and working and out on his own now, and I dont know why Im still here.  I keep hoping my next set of nerve blocks will go wrong and I wont make it, so my kid will get some insurance money, but I guess Im going to be here until I have suffered enough for whatever wrongs I have committed that I need to suffer for.. I have tried therapy, religion, meditation, medication, positive thinking, etc etc... and it works for bits and pieces of time, but I really hope that I dont have to eke out another decade in agony, both physical and mental.  Just needed to vent, thanks.","1"
"I feel grateful that everyone around me loves me enough to be disappointed in me; it's a new and different pain from being alone to be a disappointment.  It used to be that all I had was my NMom and all she did was expect me to fail and then revel in it.I want to succeed so badly; in school, work, health, everything.  I want to just be average and have good days and bad days here and there.  But I can't.  I do stupid things for stupid reasons.  I can't focus.  Whenever I feel happy I feel guilty about it and have a downspike of sadness and frustration that I can hardly handle.  I feel guilty when I enjoy things or when I have bright points.  I feel guilty when I mess up, and these days I mess up all the time.I am seeing a therapist for the first time in two and a half years tomorrow; I am seeing a therapist for the first time since the bad times, and it is the same therapist.  I feel like my whole life is caught up under a single pin so things that happened two years ago feel like they happened yesterday and I can remember them like flashbulb memories, but at the same time I cannot remember what people say or do now and I can't focus on them now.  I can't learn and every minute seems to go by at the speed of a second.  I keep trying new things to fix myself and each thing works at like half a percent.  I would put myself at like 35% improved in the last 2.5 years.I'm so overwhelmed.  I just want to curl up in bed and breathe, and sink into the mattress and diminish into it, decompose into it until I am an inanimate object.  I'm so tired.","1"

"Im sure we all felt the void and it's what led us here, im reaching out for some sort of help because i lack the means to address it and im unsure how to address it, but if i speak here and no one sees it or cares i can at least get something out. The depression is deep and i have no one to turn too for soild advice, my family was never super close to me and i essentially lost my grandmother who was rasing me from cancer and been living on friends couches ever since. There was a brief period where i was staying with my mother who is a substance abuser who just ended up using the money i was giving her for rent to support her habit (something i wasnt aware of at the time) and i ended up getting evicted loosing all my belongings and working a dead end job while having no money to afford rent on my own nor any money to support myself through college or really any hope at all anymore. My experiences have effected the person i am and i hate it i dont like this version of me but i lack the ability to change myself or this feeling. I don't wanna sound cliche, like whoa is me im depressed so feel bad i genuinely don't. In fact that's the worst aspect of it that i hate. I want to make people feel good, im the guy who will stride to give you a smile even when on the inside im dying. And i do get shown appreciation from people for my positive actions but because of the void i have inside any showing of affection towards me doesn't feel genuine. I've gained a perspective where it's made it difficult to deeply connect with people, although people still seem to gravitate towards me, still i feel a complete disconnect with them. Im scared, i know this is a crippling mental illness, and the more i shove it aside the more it manifests in different ways. I want to change i want help, it's just extremely difficult and therapy doesn't help, or maybe i havent found the right type but i need something at this point even if it's a anonymous reddit post.","1"
"Depression has hit me like a train since some minutes ago. I was getting ready for bed, and boom suddenly I lost the will to exist. I've been taking meds for months now, but these episodes are simply getting worse. I don't have the heart to tell my therapist and doctor that I'm not really getting any better.  I'm helpless right now. My heart aches for some reason. I just want everything to end yet I'm afraid of the void. I'm incredibly lonely and have almost no one to depend on.  I'm a mess.

I have goals I'd like to reach and just was given a dream come true opportunity as a musician, but I never have the time to work on it when I get home.I'm mostly scared about my job, I've really struggled the past month and got nearly nothing accomplished. Ideally I'd leave, but idk how hard it would be to get a job somewhere else. Things just suck and I don't know how to cope or make things better.

"Does anybody else live with hidden depression? Im a 26 year old female with a good job, very good friends, not a perfect life but Im doing ok. I dont suffer with issues about the way I look or my personality but I spend a lot of time feeling like Im carrying around a dark secret that no one else would really understand. I had a good childhood really, but my mum was depressed a lot of the time and is quite highly strung and critical though at the same time very loving. My dad was abusive to her though he left when I was young but I do have a relationship with him. Theres been a lot of stuff over the years that when I look back I think, thats a lot to deal with but Ive always just got on with it because I dont really feel like I have anything to be depressed about. I was very depressed in 2012, I nearly failed uni but managed to bring it back.  Again in 2014 and I was having nightly panic attacks so no one actually knew and I can feel myself slipping back into feeling depressed again. I have a fun/good life but then days like today hit, when I can hardly get out of bed, dont go to work and spend most of the day crying and I wonder should I tell at least someone? My mum keeps asking whats wrong but I dont feel I can talk to her and I went to a therapist a couple of times but whenever I went I felt like I was just over reacting and they probably cant help anyway so I just go back to life until the next episode hits. I also have a best friend who is great but I just dont feel theres anything she can particularly do to help me. Im just writing to see if anyone else out there feels the same and how you cope? ","1"

I want to become a cop, I want a job when I grow up, I shouldn't even be typing this as if one of my friends find out about this I will get roastedI've been told and heard for the past 3 years that life gets better but it never does.... and that's the harsh reality I had to learn the hard way.There are only a few things that have kept me from killing myself till now- My family- My religion And the fact that people are going through life harder than me, and reading and understanding that I'm not alone.","1"

"F/38 I've suffered from depression since I was an early teen. I've been fairly free and clear of depression for the last couple of years, due to having my ovaries removed, it helped a great deal but recently I've started to suffer from anxiety, panic attacks and can feel the depression curling around my ankles. I don't want to go back, I lost most of my twenties to this and I don't want to lose my forties. So my question is this, how do you get motivated to do stuff? It seems most of my motivation is used up by just going to work and plastering a smile on my face, at the end of the day I can't seem to motivate myself to lose weight, read, go and see friends, even draw.

"Hey everyone, first time ever posting on reddit so bear with me. I've struggled with depression from the time I was born, got diagnosed before I was 10. I've been on many medications, and was on Effexor fairly successfully for over 10 years but after a time it stopped doing the trick. My doctor took me off it and I tried Wellbutrin and then Lexapro to no avail. Now I'm on Prozac, which I just started two weeks ago. I'm only on 20mg which is a very low dose for me (I typically need high doses to get any effect at all from drugs) but my psych won't raise the dose yet. So here's my problem. My depression has been out of control and today I got sent home early from my job because of it. I'm a dog groomer, so I work a fairly high risk job with animals. I have been so depressed lately that I have no empathy left. I have a super short fuse and I have been lashing out at the dogs when they misbehave in the slightest. I wind up handling them roughly, and even before I touch them they can tell I'm unbalanced. They're scared of me. Today my boss called me out for handling a dog too roughly and I just broke down. He sent me home for today and gave me the option of taking tomorrow off as well but I don't see how that'll help. My medications aren't working and I can't even begin to guess how long it will be till they are. My psych told me about a program called a Partial Hospitalization Program where you go into the hospital for 4/5 hours a day every day for a few weeks for treatment. I'm considering trying to get into such a program, but I don't even know if it's helpful. Group therapy sounds like hell to me. I already can barely function during regular 1 on 1 therapy sessions. When I talk about my depression I start bawling so my therapy sessions are spent with me in tears the entire time. I feel WORSE after therapy. My options are; take a few weeks off work to go to the hospitalization program (hopefully still have a job when I get back), quit my job and try to find something less stressful, or continue at my job and try my hardest to control my temper and depression. I'm open to anyone's thoughts, suggestions, experiences, alternative medicines, etc. Thank you for listening ","1"

"I've been on 10mg of Lexamil/Lexapro for 2 months now and exams start in a week for me (I actually have one less serious one tomorrow). So this will be the first time I'm writing tests while on meds, usually these are times when my anxiety and depression are particularly bad. I've never felt more apathetic towards exams than I do with these, but at the same time I've never really felt less anxious about it all. I'm not depressed or anxious in my usual state. I don't know how to focus anymore and my quality of work is much harder to maintain. I'm very easily distracted and drawn to other things, because these exams seem pointless to study for, despite being the most important exams I've ever written. I'm really afraid I'll fail this grade. I don't know what to do, and I just want help but don't know who to ask. I say I'm not depressed in my usual state, because life is going great in every other regard. I feel happy and fulfilled with every other aspect of my life, at least I think so. I have friends, girls, family, a career path I'd like to go into, a lovely home, everything I want, there's nothing else but these exams bringing me down.I guess this is just a rant. But if anyone can help or if this helps anyone else I'd be glad.","1"
"I just need to understand that what Im feeling is okay and its valid to feel this way. Im not diagnosed with depression and I dont want to self-diagnose. I feel hollow honestly. The only thing I can really feel is little bits of happiness and full blown sadness. My first thought of killing myself was back in fifth grade. Im 15 and a freshman in high school. Ive suffered these types of feelings for 4 years. For those 3 years I believed what I was feeling was just puberty. As time went on though I came to realize something was wrong. I used to be very cheery outside and since I transferred schools Ive only just started being my real self. I feel the major personality change I had wasnt a personality change but really because something was wrong with my mental health. I used to love dancing but lost slow interest. Video editing projects I started would end up unfinished because I lost motivation. The only real thing that I stayed with is gaming. I used to think what was the point of getting up every morning? I felt purposeless. Like just some hollow person who went through everyday life. I didnt live life, I just did it. Around my middle school years it became worse. The guy I had a crush on probably crushed what little holes I had. Not only was he my actual best friend at the time but he also had a girlfriend who always tried to be better then me. I had a best friend who seemed to be my friend manipulate me. She turned people who were there for me and made me think they were against me. My long time friend who I can just be me with, she made me think he was terrible. My friend who was there and the first person to realize I have depression (the guy who was my crush), she made me think he would try to bully me. I felt so manipulated and taken advantage of from her. I hate myself for listening to her. Im out of that toxic friendship, its gone. After my 8th grade year, I met my current boyfriend from another friend who, Im going be honest, left once we started dating. My boyfriend at the time just wants to help and try to make me happy. He always ask how am I and did I sleep well and how Im feeling that day. He always compliments me and always tells me I love you. And hes genuine because in return I do the same. He has self-image issues that I wont share. After meeting him (hes told me that he wants me to find a therapist because professional treatment is what I need) I decided this year to try and fully understand why I feel sad in the most happiest of moments, why I feel hollow, why I feel so alone when Im the least loneliest, why I feel like I dont matter when I know I do matter. I want to die but I know I want to live. I just need to understand what is this feeling Ive been feeling for the past 4 years.","1"
"I can feel myself going into a dark slump.  My body hurts, I dont feel anything, I dont have healthcare but I know I need help.  Therapy, meds.  Im at loss of words to explain how sad and worthless I feel.  I fantasize with going to sleep and never waking up again.  Everyone arounds me knows and tries their best to help but it just doesnt work and it hurts because I know they are trying.  I function at work and then I just disintegrate.  How do I get out of this relapse? ","1"
"Do you guys feel worse during the morning or at night? Woke up very low and teary, but I am going to exercise and study and try to suppress it.  I usually feel better during the day and them some nights it comes crawling back. It's also raining today and apparently a sudden weather change is also a trigger for the low moods. (bummer.

"Hi guys, I've been with my partner for 4 years now and recently his depression is getting much much worse, he is struggling to find work and he is trying to loose weight, he has lost 2 stone so far but still wants to loose another 4, every day he is down because he gets up, plays computer games and counts calories, every day is the same, I can't get him out of the house as he isn't confident enough, he won't join a college course or anything like that until he has lost weight. He has had a few jobs in the past but finds it difficult to stick to them, every day he tells me how he hates his life but I can't get him to change it. I don't want to force him as I understand that he can't help feeling like this and honestly in his situation I would feel the same. He doesn't have any other friends as they have all moved on, but he compares himself to other people all the time, he is resting his life on weight loss but won't do anything until he has lost the weight. I don't know how to help, he tells me every day that it's just another wasted day and I really want to help Please help me help himThank you so much ","1"
"I have a question for anyone who knows medical stuff, I have a feeling in my gut that this isn't right but I want to know if I'm just over thinking it. I don't want to say who for so I'll just make a hypothetical (FYI this is really long and took place in the last month, please forgive any misspelling or punctuation/wrong grammar, I'm mad and I sometimes can't type as fast as I think lol)So docter said you need to do to a psychiatrist to get a better opinion on medication for your long time chronic depression and anxiety, you do and they say that the medication you are on now isn't working well enough (venlafaxine time release 75mg) you have been on this for over 2 years and just came down from 150mg early in the year but the higher dose of medication made you have more side effects, so they say they're going to send over new meds and get you off ven 75mg by you taking 37.5 pills for 3 days and come see them in two weeks...But when you pick up the new pills at the pharmacist the medication ven is actually 75mg but you where sure she said 37.5 mg because why would she send over meds you already have? So you just cut them in half and go about your week.4 days in you stop taking the new meds because they keep you awake all night and for some reason makes your OCD worse, you call the therapist and tell her this, she says stop taking it and get back on ven for the week till You see her again, she sends your pharmacist a prescription for 35.7 the right amount this time. You do what she says.You go to your appointment, she asks what side effects you had on the new medication, even after you told her all this over the phone, then she says you should try another kind of drug (zooloft 25mg AND wellburtin 75mg )you ask if you do the same 3 days of ven with it then stop like last time, she looks surprised and ask are you still on that? You said yes you sent it over to my pharmacist after we talked not 7 days ago , then she said oh yeah do That. Now you feel like you don't trust someone who forgets something big like what pills you're on and throws meds at tou before getting your medical records and you only take one of the pills she wants you too (you skip adding the Zoloft) and just take the Wel 75mg but after doing so for almost two weeks your withdraws from Ven are so fucking horrible , you feel like not getting out of bed because you cry at a drop of a hat, you are super dizzy, sad and pissed at the same time, BAD brain zaps and it feels like you have itchy pins and needles all over your skin . You feel like she made you get off the van way to quickly.On top of that you are also on adderall 10mg twice a day and she wants to up that to 3 a day , so when you first met her she said just start taking 3 a day and she will refill it next time you see her, you do what she says, she then gives you a skrip for that and you drop it off, then you get a phone call from rite aid saying you just had the Adderal filled weeks ago and they called the therapist and she wants you to call her asap, this triggers your extreme anxiety and you go into panic mode, she picks the phone and says ""you told me you have been on Adderal since 2015 ! And I was just told you just had it filled 2 weeks ago!""You talk really fast when you are panicked you try and say I have been on it since 2015, she says after sighing says the 15th of what?! You say again 2015 and then explain to her you where just doing what she told you to do, she says to that well you where told to bring in the bottle for me to look at but sorry for this misunderstanding.Is this ok? I feel like this woman is an idiot and she be reported to whoever but I have horrible trust issues. Thoughts? Again sorry for the book.","1"
"My story is long and complicated, as Im sure is everyone elses. My depression has completely ruined me for years on years now. Its ruined my engagement, some of my relationship with my mother before she passed of cancer, its ruined multiple friendships, and its also sometimes pushed my daughter away from me. Now that Im a single father for the first time, and raising my daughter Im starting to learn that shes the very reason for me being here. But sometimes I just cant handle the anxiety and depression. Ive tried it all, name it and Ive almost tried it probably. I just dont know the path to go down anymore.   ","1"
"UPDATE I had my first behavioral therapy session in aeons today, and signs are pointing to C-PTSD.

I'm currently on short-term disability for my depression and anxiety. I've got a good team of professionals to help me, but everyone was ""so shocked"" there was anything wrong, because I've suppressed so much for so long. I'm writing to try and become transparent about my illness, to hopefully take a few swings at the stigmas, and maybe to help people. If you'd like to read, I'd love some feedback, maybe some ideas on what to deeper-dive into for future posts.

"First, quick question about anti depressants, i got prescribed an SSRI (can't remember the name right now i think its Topamaxin i may be saying it wrong tho) and people have told me not to take them bc they make u like a zombie if you aren't on them like u can feel anything ur dead inside, is that true? that's my only concern. i don't want to have to live on them forever yaknow. oh yeah and the side effects i read about this specific medication were really bad like kidney failure and crazy shit so that's also why i'm scared to take them. i want them to help bc i'm sick of feeling like this but i don't wanna like die from any side effects lmfao so i just been sitting on them haven't touched em yet. or do u have any recommendations for some good ones? also i read somewhere about how one side effect of depression can be feeling super slow and even dumb when really you are smart your brain just works slow ive been at a constant battle with that. does counseling help w all these issues? i been wanting to try some type of therapist but my anxiety gets in the way i get nervous to go talk to some stranger plus my depression makes me procrastinate everything  which is another main problem in every aspect in my life. can't hold jobs bc of it. everyday is just a constant struggle man. i need to start making steps to try to fix this and get out of this hole of depression. or if anyone has any tips in general on dealing w depression/anxiety lmk ill appreciate anything i can get  thank u xoxo ","1"
"I've had depression and anxiety since I was 8 or 9 years old, although it was much worse then than it is now. However, over a decade later I'm ready to really shake this shit off. I know it'll probably always be there to some extent, but I'm tired of giving it the authority to rule over some of my days. I don't really know where to start on this. I finally made an account so I can start sharing my experiences, which I guess may help some. I'm considering making an appointment with my school's counselors since they're free. I haven't told anyone except my husband about my struggles with depression and anxiety, although I'm almost positive my mom knew about my anxiety before I understood I had anxiety. Anyway, does anyone have any suggestions as to where to even start working on lessening depression/anxiety's control over your life? What was the first thing you did when you decided trying to rough it out by yourself wasn't working?","1"
"So I recently talked to my doctor about my depression and he gave me some medication. It's helping a lot and thank god I got it on time because I found out that my dad has strange 4 cancer and my mom is having surgery and won't be able to move her right arm for eight weeks and not my grandmother which I live with as well has pulled a muscle near or around her lung... and I'm the next oldest person in the house (17) who can clean and cook and help out so I was hoping to join only school so I won't be so stressed with time, but I can't join till January!

"Hello,I have been struggling with depression most of my life. I have had time periods, almost a full year, where everything was solid and right now not so much. So I felt my depression start to creep back in a couple of months ago. I went to my doc and asked him to put me on welbutrin xl 150mg, I was on this in college and it really helped.But this time around is a completely different experience. My anxiety is totally through the roof. And throughout to say I am going from depressed to manic mode. Not to mention I can hardly concentrate for any period of time.There is also nothing in my life currently that triggered the depressionI have an appointment with him in two days to get me the hell off this but I wanted to know if anyone else has made the move from welbutrin to another anti-depressant. What did you switch to? How long did you wait till you made the switch? Did you have to end up taking a second medication in the long run?Overall, I need to not feel depressed, I have Xanax as needed, small 0.5mg dosage, and I need to be able to do generate at work, not have a dead sex drive and not eat everything in sight. Maybe I'm asking for too much?Thoughts?","1"
"Please allow me to introduce myself and give some background context. I'm a 26 year old male and I've been depressed for as long as I can remember. School was hell, I was bullied all the way through until I finally made it out ((barely)). I flunked out of college which can be attributed heavily to depression. I've traveled quite a few places for many years looking for some kind of happiness. Eventually, homeless in San Francisco and slowly letting myself die, I had to come back home. This brings us to last year. Two days after Christmas, my mom was in a car wreck that crushed half her body, rendering it basically useless. A month and a half later, on Valentine's Day, she had a stroke that paralyzed the other side of her body. A couple months after that, we found out she has blood clots in her heart. She is now 100% dependant. My father was diagnosed with schizophrenia about 10 or 15 years ago. He is anywhere from 15-75% dependant, based upon if it's a good or bad day. I also have 3 younger siblings, ages 11, 13, and 15. Basically, I'm taking care of everyone. I've also recently just got a new job because the workers comp and disability checks simply aren't enough. I'm losing my mind. My dad and I got into an argument last week and I yelled out that I can't live in this house anymore, I have to move. Except it costs too fucking much to move. I feel like there are too many people depending on me to stay, but how do I stay when I don't care if I wake up or not? Some days I literally get mad at myself for waking up another day. I can't juggle all this anymore, but I don't feel I'm being given an option to move out. I feel like some of my friends and all of my family, both immediate and extended, are guilt tripping me into staying, but honestly, how long am I supposed to stay in this position? When am I allowed to go out into the world and live my own life? Am I NOT allowed to? Why can't I find happiness? Fuck, I just want to pack up and leave in the middle of the night without telling anyone, but what would that do to them? That would only make everything worse, right? So what the fuck do I do?","1"
"Hello everyone,     I just found this subreddit today. I finally admitted to myself that I am depressed again. I have been struggling with depression all of my life. I can remember having very strong symptoms of untreated depression when I was a kid. The anger, wild emotional responses to any sort of stimulus, feelings of hopelessness, feeling that I lacked control. I don't know if my mother ever caught on to it. I'm pretty sure she struggles with depression too, although I've never asked.     I was diagnosed about a year and a half ago. Once I was given the diagnoses and I learned what the symptoms were, I realized that I have had this disease since I was very young. It went unnoticed and untreated, so I knew right off of the bat that it was going to be a long struggle for me.     I have a chronic brain disease, and it's called depression. It is trying to isolate me from people. It wants me to stay in my house and lay in bed for hours, willing myself to move. It wants me to chase everyone in my life away. It's telling me that I don't deserve help. But I don't want depression to win this time. My disease is not as sneaky as it used to be.     I just moved (which is a huge trigger for anyone) to a new state and started a new school. Basically, everything is new and I don't have people. I did, but all of my people live in other states now. I'm trying to plan out what people I need without overwhelming myself. I need my workout buddy. I need someone who will encourage me to get outside and move. Running, lifting, anything.      I need my study buddy. Studying is so overwhelming sometimes, and just having a person there, even if they are silent the whole time helps. It is comforting knowing that someone else is working alongside you.     I need my healthy person. You know that person that just oozes natural hippie health? They just have this way about them, and they always know herbal tea that will help with this and the recipe full of such and such nutrients. I LOVE these people. And I need one. All of the stress and anxiety that I have been experiencing has wreaked havoc on my stomach. One of the most forgotten symptoms of depression is gastric distress without a specific cause that doesn't go away with medicine. I need to heal my insides. They always hurt.        I need my meditation buddy. They help you keep you calm. They have these gentle spirits that make you want to be like them.     I need work buddies. The ones that make you laugh when work is tough.     I need my adventure buddy. That one person who always knows what is going on in town. They are the life of the party and you always have a good time with them.     Most of all, I need professional help. I can't do this by myself. I have tried more than once to ""cure"" myself. But I can't. I feel like so many people like us feel like we don't need to go to someone about depression because it's ""just a mood thing"" or because ""it's caused by hormone swings"". We assume that if we wait long enough it will just magically disappear. But it wont. We don't wait for ear infections to just go away. We go to the doctor and we get help making it go away. Then we help ourselves by using preventative measures, like cleaning our ears properly after a swim. When we get the flu, we don't wait around for it to go away. We don't want to be incapacitated by a sickness that will go away quicker if we go get help from a doctor. We get medicine, we learn how to prevent it, and then we change habits. Why isn't it the same with depression? I need help. I will beat this disease faster with help. I will be given tools that I didn't know were available to me. Once I get the professional help that I need, I will start using my preventative measures, like expanding my support system and I will start changing habits. But first, I need help from a doctor.    Even if no one reads everything here, I needed to say it. This post is for me. If anyone else is positively affected by this, that is a very happy plus.TD:LR   I have depression. It's coming back full swing. I need friends and I need help.","1"

"Hi, call me Jasper (not my real name), I have some issues and I really need help with them.

"I'm 18 and a senior in highschool. A couple of years ago, me and my two sisters were taken from my parents by DSS. After getting out and coming back to my parents, life has been hell.

"I'm an older student in a foreign country, my family lives in another part of the world, and the past few years I've lost all my support systems, mostly due to moving to another country. I was coping for a few years, then two major things happened. A close family-member died, and instead of allowing myself to grieve, I lost myself in work until I had a burn-out. Secondly, a toxic, co-dependent friendship with an abusive and controlling person ended, in a very explosive manner, which heightened my social anxiety exponentially.When that person left my life, I didn't have it in me to preserve a circle of friends that would force me to run into this person, socially. A few months later, someone told me this person was telling people I did something I didn't do, and I didn't even try to defend myself. I didn't have the social stamina to deal with this, I still don't.I also had to leave the place we both worked at, in order to cut this person out of my life, where they were in a position of power over me, withheld information from me, and started excluding me from meetings by forgetting to forward e-mails to me, or giving me the wrong time or location. If I felt safe enough to file a complaint, I would have, but I don't. The structure is very nepotistic, to put it mildly. Their partner is the only person who is ranked higher than they are.My social options are very limited. I live in a small town, and I am overwhelmed by schoolwork. I developed insomnia about 6 months ago, and talked to my doctor about it, but I am not being treated for it. My doctor didn't see a need to treat it medically, or perhaps they didn't want to prescribe any pils.I don't have a psychiatrist here (I've had really bad experiences with different types of medication, and therefore prefer cognitive therapy, etc.), I was finally referred to a psychologist, but there are long waiting periods, anywhere between 2 weeks and 3 months, and I have yet to see them for the first time.I'm in the middle of exams, and I keep not handing in things, because I can't. I was consistently an overachiever for years, but my level has slipped a lot over the past year, because I can't do the things I was able to do a year ago. I can't even believe I was good at something, once. It especially hurts because my identity is very much vested in what I do. It gave my life meaning and direction. Now I can't even complete a task. Nevermind the quality of my work.I don't really sleep, and as a result I can't study or effectively write papers. I'll try to force myself to go to sleep, then stare at my wall until my alarm goes off. I've also tried wearing a sleeping-mask, to block out all light. On a good night, when I do sleep, I sleep up to 4 hours, because I'll wake up continuously, be awake for 1-2 hours again, drift off for an hour, wake up, repeat, and eventually not be able to go back to sleep at all. It feels like I don't really get any restful sleep at all, it's more like, horizontal meditation. Sometimes I have anxiety dreams, but not all the time. I am very sensitive to noise, and the slightest sound makes me anxious, and my heart starts racing and keeps racing for ages. I live alone and sleep with a boxcutter next to me, because I live in a rough neighbourhood. It's where I can afford to live. I physically block my bedroom door with furniture before I go to bed, it gives me a little peace of mind, knowing that if someone did try to come in, I'd hear it, because they'd have to break through that barrier. I don't do this shit when I'm healthy. It's an anxiety ritual that stems from when a man broke into my hotel room when I was a teenager, probably to steal money from us. I wasn't alone and the other person woke up when I started screaming, and the man ran away, which the other person heard, and he left the door open when he ran away, further proving it wasn't a dream, which is what the hotel tried to convince me of. After that I slept in the bathtub, with the door locked for the rest of our stay, like a crazy person, and I started stacking furniture up against doors, as an extra barrier. We filed a complaint, and nothing happened. They never found the guy. Whenever I move into a new place, or sleep alone in a hotel room, or if I'm particularly vulnerable to anxiety at that moment in time, it comes back to me and I start stacking furniture in order to feel a little bit safer. Right now it's back.When I read, I have to re-read things up to 5-6 times because I'm not absorbing any information. My memory is terrible, and when I mention this to my family, they think I'm being dramatic, but I know. I just know this is not normal.I know my professors and the administration have noticed, but I am not comfortable disclosing my medical history. I have spoken to a study counsellor, but currently don't have time to speak to them. They also signalled to me that this is a psychiatric issue, and there isn't much (more) they can do for me. I've been hospitalised before. It's what I'm trying to resist. The prospect of ""losing more time"" by being hospitalised, or worse, not finishing school, fills me with so much dread, also for reasons I can't afford to explain right now.My peers and some members of my family only seem to contact me when they need a favour. There are weeks where I don't even have a conversation with another person. Not even on facebook or anything. My closest relatives are busy and in different timezones. I also don't want to make them worry.About half a year ago, I broke up with my boyfriend. We had grown apart, and it was difficult to salvage over long-distance. We mutually agreed it was best to break-up, and it was a friendly break-up, but still painful. A few months ago, his parent fell violently ill, and was diagnosed with terminal cancer. I try to be supportive, because I know he needs me, and I want to be there for him, but it's difficult. I don't know how to comfort him. I'm in such a negative state, that I don't know how to be a positive presence. I can do practical things, like find information and resources, which is how I hide the state I'm in from him, but I shut down when it gets heavy, or he starts crying. My brain just stops working. There aren't even any thoughts racing through my mind, everything just shuts down, it's like blacking-out.  I listen, but I can't find the right words when he's done talking, and I know I sound like a broken record when I speak. We weren't together when my family-member died, but he's going through a lot of the same things I went through then, and I just know that my broken-record words are trash. He deserves more emotional support than what I'm able to give him. We don't talk that much, but he's the most consistent contact I have.When I'm ill, one of the first things that happens, is that I physically can't even bring myself to do the dishes, eat, wash clothes, or take care of my surroundings. Other people, especially those with ADD might relate. Don't worry, this part has a good ending.When you're both depressed and you live in a constant state of mental chaos, it gets hard to create order, or maintain order. I was living in terrible conditions for months, but too ashamed to ask for help. I also don't have anyone I could ask for help. Some of the errands, like buying ingredients to cook, or washing clothes, even taking out the trash became too difficult for me, because of my crippling social anxiety. I had to train myself to take the trash out and wash my clothes at 5-6am, when it's too early for other people to be around, but there's enough light for me to not be scared. (If anyone is experiencing something similar, I hope that's helpful to you.) On a good day, I'm able to buy groceries (which is what's keeping me alive) but I can't even make eye-contact when I pay, because I'm afraid I might burst into tears on the spot, which has happened before.I started breaking down the mess around me into smaller tasks, and I did a little bit every day. That's what I could manage. It was a slow process, but I was sick and tired of living like that. Then something miraculous happened. I wish I could attribute it to sheer will-power, but the reality is, I was housing huge spiders (not daddy-long-legs, actual scary looking ones) and I was terrified after I'd spotted three of them. It was the push I needed to clean and wash clothes. Without that fright, I am ashamed to say I would probably still be living in those conditions. Anyway, a few other incidents happened, and their cumulative effect is why I'm in a particularly bad state today. I was sexually harassed by someone I know very well, who is much larger and stronger than I am, I cleary said no, many times, but was ignored, as that person forced themself on me. Thankfully I managed to get away in the end. I told no-one, and saw them at the train station recently, which completely triggered me. They ignored me, or perhaps didn't see me, but I couldn't even bring myself to sit down, and spent an hour and a half, standing in a first-class traincar, because I didn't have a first-class ticket, but I knew that person could be in any other traincar.After that, just the other day, someone I had considered to be an old friend, inappropriately asked me for nudes in a very manipulative and cold manner, when we reconnected. I was so happy to finally be talking to someone. To have a conversation. It was devastating.Losing another ""friend"", combined with the predatorial vibe of it all, was the last drop. I feel isolated, and like my only value to anyone is my sexuality or my usefulness to them, and it hurts. I try not to dwell on these feelings or thoughts, but they're there, in the back of my mind, especially the more tired I get.The only person close enough to me, that I could theoretically talk to about this, is my ex, and I can't bring myself to do it. His parent might be dying and the last thing I want to do is to complain about other guys sexually harassing me, he doesn't need my shit on top of his. I am waiting to see my psychologist for the first time, but I don't know if I can wait that long. Depression is not considered an emergency unless you're suicidal.I wish I could sleep. I think a lot of my problems right now stem from lack of sleep, or that the exhaustion is what makes everything so overwhelming and difficult. I think about self-medicating with alcohol, just so I can sleep at night, but I know that's not going to help me cognitively, overall it's just a terrible idea, and I don't want to resort to that.I can't just change doctors either. I feel stuck. I don't know what to do until I see the psychologist. I've had a few recurring suicidal thoughts, the past year, but no strong suicidal feelings, which in my experience tells me I'm not at my worst. That's the silver lining I cling onto.The problem is, I am aware it could change at any moment. I'm very afraid of getting to that point before I see the psychologist, because if you suffer from any type of cyclical depression, and haven't found a combination of meds that works for you, you know this won't be the last time you go through this. I am sorry about this wall-of-text. I would like to ask for advice, maybe any natural remedies or tips and tricks to help me sleep? I am taking supplements (containing magnesium and melatonin) that are supposed to help, but they haven't made a difference. I've also tried exhausting myself physically, and I was going to the gym thrice a week before my social anxiety was at its worst, it didn't make a difference and, but the last time I went, there was a significantly older man in the sitting/coffee-break area, staring at me, the entire 45 minutes I was on the treadmill. He then got very close to me, and loitered, pacing around me, but never speaking to me, when I started my strength-training in another part of the gym. It was a quiet hour at the gym, and the only other person there, was the front-desk staff. I was too uncomfortable and anxious, and gave up after five minutes, went home and I haven't been back since. I know I have a huge conflict-avoidance issue where I run away instead of standing up for myself, especially when it involves a man, or an any type of authority figure. I have two reactions: Freeze or flee. Flee being the best-case scenario. Never fight. Never ask for help. I would like to receive CBT to help me overcome situations like that, but we're not there yet.Furthermore, I would like to ask how to preserve your sanity when you're isolated? So, a temporary measure. I don't plan to be a hermit forever, but right now that's my reality. I tried reading, but I mentioned earlier than I'm not absorbing anything, which is making it hard to read. Unrelated, but I've also started stuttering for the first time in my life. I wish I could go back to work, but I can't sit through any job interviews right now. Typing all of this out was hard, but I actually feel a little bit of relief. I had a good cry as I was correcting the spelling mistakes I noticed. It feels like I talked to someone, even though I just typed out a monologue. ","1"
"So long story short I have mild cerebral palsy on my left side. I've been depressed for almost two weeks now and I woke up very energetic and I thought things would be better. They were okay. I studied for my midterm for a bit but throughout the day my energy levels slowly started dropping. And now I just feel and emotionless and numb I can't even describe it. I think I have bipolar disorder type 2i don't know. My grandpa and Dad have it but it's not diagnosed. Considering the circumstances. I just feel also depersonalizaloed.   I don't know what emotions feel like and I feel like I'm empty. I'm making an appointment with my doctor soon. I just need a solid game plan for this. ","1"

"I'm a 15 year old girl and I'm in 10th grade. I feel like every thing good in my life is slipping through the cracks and I don't know what to do. I really need some serious insight and advice. This past summer (summer of 2017) I make a very big decision. I decided to homeschool myself for an entire semester. The reason I chose to do this is because I've been going through a lot and I made a lot of ""teenager"" mistakes over the summer. I feel like I made the decision in a moment of panic. When I told my mom she was eager for me to be homeschooled because my mom, growing up, did not have a childhood and basically had no teenager moments. She had a negative look on a lot of things and I am sick of it. Anything boy related, drama related, friend ships, hanging out with friends, sleep overs, school, sports, shopping, popularity, etc. I respect the fact that growing up she wasn't allowed or ""interested"" in doing teenager or girly things, and it's hard to just accept all of that at once, but come on! So that alone made my first year of high school very hard. I was still adjusting and trying to make things normal, while she was hitting me with all her extremist crap. She pushed me to the point where I felt like I needed to rebel. I was barely allowed to go out, and I felt like I needed to make the most of my time and do everything I could possibly do because I didn't know when the next time I was going to be able to go out again. She had this idea in her head that me going out and having fun is a bad thing, and I really can't deal with it anymore. It's not like I was a bad kid. I always took my grades and school very seriously, I started building up passions for a sport: volleyball, a career: cyber security, I went to the gym frequently, I was always polite towards adults and I showed respect to my mom, I was a very organized person and I always tried to do what was right. I always mentally had my life together. But after I hit the midpoint of 9th grade, things started falling apart. I couldn't study, my grades were going down (I was taking advanced classes), I was focusing on all the wrong things, getting in trouble, smoking pot, drinking and I became very disorganized at home and at school. This continued on until I made that decision nearing the end of the summer. I thought that I needed that break, and I thought homeschooling would help me get myself back together. I wanted to come back second semester ahead of all my classmates in academics, and generally as better version of myself. It's already the end of October. You know what happened? I lost all motivation for everything, even things I liked, I woke up at 10 every morning, I finished 3 full shows on Netflix, my room was always a mess, I barely washed my face or brushed my teeth in the morning so I felt ugly and crappy all the time, I started smoking cigarettes, I kept getting my phone taken but when I had it snap chat, instagram, VSCO, twitter, and all the rest of my social media apps were deleted because I couldn't even stand to look at what my friends were doing or where they were going out everyday and having fun, I ate shitty food all the time, I cried at random times, I barely did any school work ( I used khan academy and signed up for chemistry, world history, and pre calc- all I got done was the first topic of chemistry and 1 world history video), all my friendships fell apart because I listerslly didn't talk to ANYONE, my boyfriend who I was able to hangout with a couple times over the summer is still trying to make things work with me (I don't know how or why because I barely get to see him), and so much more. Basically, my life just went down. Every time I think about my friends or school or the minimal work I'm doing and how little I leave the house, I fall into a pit of depression. That's how I feel right now- depressed, stuck, stupid, crappy, and hopeless.","1"
"I've dealt with depression since I was in elementary school. Over the years it progressively got worse until I hit my lowest in High School. After I moved off to college things slowly started to get better. I was able to make new friends and start fresh. Living in a dorm made it hard for me to sleep away my days because my roommate was an early riser, and my friends would pop in and wake me up to come hang out. It was nice living in a community where I was constantly surrounded by my closest friends.But I graduated college and moved away to a new city, and now I'm struggling to adjust. For the past couple years I saw my boyfriend nearly every day. Now I only see him once or twice a month. I didn't have any friends moving here, except my sister, who I live with. Now, my sister is one of my best friends, so I thought that living with her would make adjusting easier, and to some extent it probably has. Who knows where I would be if I was totally alone.But I underestimated how hard this would be. Having my sister around still isn't the same as having all my close friends and boyfriend in the same city. Especially when she is busy with her own life.I think one of my main issues is that I am having a hard time finding new friends. I've made one new friend here, who we can call Stew, but really I'm just friends with him because I'm lonely, and not because I particularly enjoy his company. I know that sounds bad, but Stew asked if I wanted to hangout. I said yes, figuring I might as well give him a chance even though I found him annoying. He is kind, but tends to take every conversation and make it about himself, and always have to ""one-up"" me. Anyway, so far he is the only friend I've made, probably because he pursued a friendship and I just went along with it.Before I moved here, my doctor was weaning me off of my meds, and now I'm scared to death because I can feel the depression creeping its way back in, and I don't want to go through it again. I mean, it never totally disappeared, but I was at least happy most days, and on days when I felt down I dealt with it. Now I feel like a sitting duck, just waiting for it to hit me full force. I was in the shower the other day and I just had this wave of sadness wash over me out of nowhere that paralyzed me. I didn't even want to move. It was a familiar feeling I hadn't felt in a long time.Has anyone been in a similar situation of either having to adjust to a new city, or adjust to a LDR? What strategies helped you make the change? I know different things work for everyone and there is no magical answer, but I figured it wouldn't hurt to ask from some things to try.Also, I cross-posted this in r/depression just because I thought it would get more responses there. If there is anywhere else I should post let me know. Thanks in advance, guys.TL;DR: The title of the post sums it up. New City, LDR, no real friends except my sister near me. Looking for those who have been through a similar situation, and can describe strategies that helped them get through it.","1"
"So, I took this years ago as a kid, and hated it. I was seven years old and totally faked taking it most of the time, but now as an adult it totally messed my head up.

"Long story here, but basically I'm trying to manage my relationship with my father.We have hardly spoken since 2011, when I left his house at 23 y/o after he and his wife threw my 20 y/o brother out for having a marijuana joint in his room. It was the last straw of many. I couldn't be there any longer and I've been on my own since. I have a good job, got married, and recently, bought my first home with my husband.I sent a lot of extended relatives a ""we moved!"" post card, my dad included. His response was a hand-written letter that outlined that while he wishes he could be happy for me, he can't because of our rocky past and my fractured relationship with his wife. This isn't the first letter of this type he's sent me, and he's sent letters like this to other relatives (his parents, his brothers) - basically outlining everything crappy you've ever done and how you need to apologize and prove your worth to him and his wife, but won't ever say how.It hurts. I realize that I'll be 30 soon and there is nothing I will ever do to make him proud of me. While a letter like this in my early 20's would have me in the fetal position for days at a time, I now can carry on well enough that it's just kind of this looming thing at the back of my mind. Whenever I get these letters, it's like any amount of self esteem I've built up comes crashing down again and I start from zero. I'm really, really, really bummed out and I'm not sure how to articulate this to others since I feel like situations like this one never happen. Advice? I do not plan on responding, since that might just feed the fire. But I just want to feel better about myself despite him paraphrasing I'm a POS.","1"

She was get angry and irritable easily, she even said she doesnt feel any emotion. When she broke things off with me, she said I dont if its you or the tablets that are making me unhappy. Like Im so confused and really down about everything. One minute she wants to be with me and now she doesnt. Its been nearly 2 months now not seeing her and limited contact. I tried cutting contact and when I mentioned it she said thats up to me but I am the only person she can talk too about the whole situation she is going through (she hasnt really told me fully whats happening with her and why she is depressed).

"I don't know. For all my life I've been put down into depression. My sisters are avoiding me and moved on with their own lives. And me Hiwever is still in high school, a freshman who got held back twice and supposed to graduate, but teachers hate me so they held me back even though it wasn't my fault that I had to miss school over a chronic illness. No one talks to me, I try to find my own clique but everyone are snobs... I sit alone everyday, hide in the stalls to cry my eyes out everyday.. I wish i had someone who cares...no one likes me they all think I'm a freak. I am no narcissist, but they all think so. I'm a normal average female the age of 17, no guy has ever complimented me and oh how I wish I was pretty.. All I think about is wishing, god never gave me a life when I feel I don't deserve it. No one understands me...And I wish there was an easy way out to committ suicide painlessly using a home remedy... But If I don't do that...then what am I going to do with my life? Live alone? Have trouble finding people who can listen to me? Get a job and be alone surrounded by animals whom don't speak to me? I tried everything to impress people, I tried too hard and I give up. I look like a fat ugly 170 pounds fish wishing to just barf all of the food out and get ""skinny"". But no I don't have bulimia or any eating disorder. I'm just a depressed teenager concerned about her own life, suicide isn't the answer...but I've been chronically thinking of it and wishing I had a normal teenage life surrounded by friends..which I never had a friend me a boyfriend. Never had sex and wish I could experience it, but then again I don't know anyone, I don't trust anyone...people at my school are all snobs and selfish beings who are all rich and pick on the poor. They stare and gawk at me when I sit alone, approach me and tell me to ""make some friends"" when I feel too humiliated to try and when I try to make friends everyone acts nice to me for a few days then abandon me. And when they talk to me all they talk about is me being the fat girl and how I need to lose weight, guys will like me more and obviously I am losing weight! But I'm not trying to impress guys to look skinny or anorexic. I just wish I was accepted for who I am and I know I am unattractive...so maybe if I'm still alive..someday I'll do all these face lifting etc. To make myself look presentable and sexy as everyone wants and expects me to look! But being able to afford all that is the most worrying option. I just wish I had friends... I deleted all of my social medias because no one talks to me and I feel so unwanted and I don't know where I belong other than the graveyard. Oh and I'm not emo nor gothic, I'm just an average aesthetic teenage girl.","1"

"Anyone who would like to talk after reading this, please PM me and I'll add you on Skype or Discord or something.I was ""homeschooled"" online from when I was 14 to 18, and I went to dual enrollment classes at the local college instead of going to a high school. At the time it seemed like a great idea, but now I'm 22 and still don't have my degreethat I should have gotten at least a year agoand have no idea what it means to have a friend for longer than a couple years.Because of that, it meant that I basically hid in my room all day growing up, unless I had a class to go towhere I didn't talk to anyone anyway. I still feel like a child most of the time, like I just want someone there to protect me and tell me everything will be okay. Does anyone else relate to that?I can drive but I don't like to and only got my license last year. And the thought of graduating and having a job is scary, as I have severe social anxiety and interacting with people scares me.I also had problems with my gender growing up, constantly questioning why I was so femininewhich caused me to transition to being a girl for the past two/three years. I thought transitioning would make everything better and that my gender was the reason I had found it difficult to become interact and become friends with people. But it didn't really help much, as I still had a lot of anxiety relating to people. It's been a confusing ride.That being said, I generally try to stay positive about things and I like reading self-help books and exposing myself to new ways of thinking, so if anyone else also struggles with depression but is trying to get better we should talk. <3","1"

"Hi all,I was in a long distance relationship for 2 years with the most lovely person I have ever met.  She was sweet, loyal and super beautiful.  She was diagnosed depression in January 2017. She started to be on meds and go to the therapy.  After a cold period between me and her, where we were often arguing for small things and after I tried to give her a motivational speech on how strongly I wanted her out of depression, she decided in September 2017 to break up with me. The break up has been quite shocking to me. It was out of the blue as she was supposed to visit me the 4th of September.  On the 3rd of September she called me, she was quite cold and told me she would have not taken the flight the day after to visit me. She explained me we were not compatible and she would have not been the right person for me. She also told me to not contact her as she did not want to talk with me anymore. She also said she would have contacted me when she was ready.  Of course we were going through a rough time, but we promised each other we would have discussed the things we could improve at her visit in September.  I really wanted to be better for her and support her in anyways. I tried to chase her until October.  Sweet texts, and bought tickets to surprise her. However, she found out I was going to visit her from her mum (I let her mum know for correctness).  She contacted me the night before the flight, asking to respect her decision to not want to see me.  That night we talked for two hours.  She was very sweet but at the same time confused.  She was telling me she wanted someone who could treat her well and give her attention she needed. Despite that she seemed to want to talk to me longer than two hours.  She really gave me the impression of a confused person.  I thought that someone like friends was influencing her to break up with me. But, I can't say that with certainty. It's true we had problems and she asked me toSkype on daily basis as she needed attention.  But, due to my stressful job, at the end of the day I m always sleepy and as soon as I get on bed I tend to fall asleep.  However, I was always texting her and 3 days a week we used to Skype until late and fall asleep together via Skype.  To be honest I could start to Skype her more if I only knew she was struggling a lot the last period.  Unfortunately, I was not aware she was getting even more depressed.  So, after the call, I tried to keep in contact with her but she asked me to not contact her and move on. I don't want to move on if I know she is struggling and I want to support her or be there when she is out of the tunnel.  The first week of October I was really frustrated as she was not answering my texts since one month and if she answered she was very short and cold. So, I texted her saying I was probably blind during all the relationship to not see how brutal she could be and I would have not even want her as friend anymore. To that text she got really upset and finally I got some real emotions from her. She told me she was struggling the last weeks and she has been suicidal.  When I heard that I felt the world to fall down. I didn't know she was going through a tough period and I completely felt guilty of her pain.  Also, she added: I'm the reason of your pain and I can't be your resolution.  You are the reason of my pain and I can't seek comfort in you. That made me even worse thinking I could be the reason of her depression.  At first moment I decided to give up, then I started to read things on depression that for me were completely new. I felt so ignorant and guilty thinking I could help her if I only knew how to. I felt scared and powerless. However, since yesterday,  I tried to apply a plan I call happiness.  I decided to send her one daily pic of her when she was happy and smily, writing some sweet sentences, motivating her on how beautiful, strong a nice person she is. I'm not doing it to win her back because I know it's impossible but I'm doing it to make her understand she is stronger than anyone in this earth. Yes, in my heart I would like to be with her but if I can't I want to see her happy and if I can do something for it it will make myself a better person for this world.  She doesn't answer my texts anymore.  Plus, after the last discussion on WhatsApp she blocked me. However,  she didn't block me on messenger.  So, I think she still want me to send some sweet texts which can make her feeling better. Do you think it can be beneficial for her?Do you guys think I'm the cause of her depression so I should stop her and move on and forget her?Do you think that her psychologist may have suggested her to interrupt the relationship as it was too stressful for her? I'm not an expert in these things so I don't know what topics during therapy people with depression discuss about.  Has someone experienced similar situations before? Will the depressed person regret the break up after the recovery? Do you have any suggestions for me?Thanks for your support. ","1"
"this was an impulsive post, so im hoping this is the correct venue. if not, id appreciate a nudge in the right direction. also, im on a throw-away. and mobile. (sorry for any formatting errors)background: my partner is depressed and has likely been so, though undiagnosed, for some time. within the last month, he started seeing a psychiatrist and therapist. we own our own home, both work full-time, and are parents to a very active toddler. my partner has great work ethic and loves playing with our son, but has lost motivation for anything else. hes tired all the time, disinterested in most things, and would prefer to just sit. hes struggling. i get it. im not mad that hes feeling this way and im THRILLED hes taking steps to help himself. i have been forced to take over responsibility for everything in our lives. i spend a lot of the week feeling like a single parent/homeowner. at this point, i feel more like a housekeeper than a partner. again, i get it. he needs my help and i needed to step up, but i have been doing this for years. im starting to resent him, while at the same time knowing hes just trying to get through the day (which adds guilt to the resentment). he gets angry when we cant spend time together (on his schedule, not mine), but the reason i cant sit down is because im doing bills/laundry/cooking dinner/cleaning/caring for the baby/packing lunches, etc. im frustrated, exhausted, and stressed, and its starting to show. were arguing all the time, i have little interest in intimacy, and i have started snapping at him a lot (very unlike me). ive been telling myself that i need to be patient, that that this wont last forever, but its getting increasingly harder to convince myself. how can i be a more supportive partner?

"Well, get ready for a hell of a lot to read. When my brother was four, and I was 1, he became diagnosed with several mental illnesses. It was hard until 2015, then it got worse. My brother got into drugs, alcohol, stealing, and various other crimes. My dad always controlled him, but in 2016 he left for Afghanistan; I see him 2 times a year. My mother, working a full time job, cannot control my brother. He has people over, trashes our house, has even let people steal from us before. To make things worse, i'm gay in the south. I told my mom in February 2017, and she told me to ""Get aids and die"" and that she ""wasn't my mom."" Being here, I am bullied at school, and my mom simply doesn't care about it at all. Everyday, my mom and brother have a huge argument, she kicked him out, then lets him back in 4 hours later. She gives him money that he uses to buy alcohol and drugs, then complains about how he's getting it. Every night, I basically go to sleep upset, or crying. My dad does care, but since he's 7300 miles away, so it's not like he can help me at all. I'm just tired, done with everything in life at this point. I don't really want to live at all. I have two friends at school who are pretty much as fake as they come, a drug addict brother, and a mom that doesn't accept me. I'm basically ready to get through this, and eventually go to college, be a doctor, and have a nice life. But for now, i'm stuck here, waiting for that day.","1"

"I've come to the realization that I'm depressed and likely have been for a while. I struggled with depression and an eating disorder about 8 years ago and tried to commit suicide once. Since then I've gone on living my life, went to college, had a long term relationship, did normal people things, but if I'm being honest with myself there has always been a ""cloud"" or just a lingering feeling of not being fully happy. I am pretty sure I have anxiety as well because I cannot escape the thoughts of what people think of me and it often cripples me. I have of course smiled and laughed throughout the years, but I don't think I've been fully fully happy. It makes me wonder if other people, most people are actually happy or does everyone feel like I do? I don't want or expect my life to be perfect but I want to reach the same level of happiness and normalcy that other have. I feel like I'm rambling....but thats kind of how my thoughts are. I have a hard time concentrating in school, at work, even when listening to family or friends. I will be looking right in to this person's eyes hearing what they are saying and next thing you know I've been thinking about something that happened to me yesterday and will have missed a minute of the conversation.I am in my late 20's right now and in back in school to pursue an advanced degree in the veterinary field, but I honestly don't know if its what I want to do. But i dont know what I want to do. I never really have. I don't have a passion in life like it seems many people do. There is not one thing I can think of that makes me truly happy and that i would want to spend the rest of my life doing. I wonder if this is because of my depression or if I'm just an aimless person who just isn't meant for a specific career. I wouldn't say I am suicidal, although I do think about it occasionally. I usually come to the conclusion that it isn't worth it and that all I want is to be happy. I don't want to die. I'm just trying to sort out my feelings and figure out what to do next. I'd like to perhaps go to therapy even though the thought of talking about myself to someone terrifies me. I'd like to perhaps go on medication, but I feel weird asking for it....also I dont have insurance right now so that complicates things....Sorry for the rambling post, I just needed to get these things off my chest.","1"

"The solutions seem obvious but I continue to fail to implement these in my life.I have had depression for most of my adult life, and am now 58years old. Cutting back on/taking a full break from marijuana, maintaining a consistent meditation habit, and more exercise seem to be the clear solutions, or at least, highly beneficial solutions, and yet, here I am, still smoking weed (a bit less than I used to though), meditating irregularly and not getting enough cardio exercise.I am retired/on permanent disability for AIDS-related issues as well as chronic depression. Gardening is one of my favorite things to do, and I am very blessed to have a large space to garden, and in which I spend many hours. I guess that is exercise, but its not really cardio.I have been on antidepressants for years, but starting about 5 or 6 months ago, I decided to cut back on my medication. From what I have read, antidepressants are not meant to be used indefinitely, and continuing to take them can actually be physically and emotionally detrimental. My intention was to supplement the lower dosage with exercise and meditation, and taking a strict abstinence from weed, but I find myself failing in these endeavors. I can and have abstained from weed for days and sometimes weeks in the past, and managed to meditate for a few days consistently now and then. But right now, I am feeling particularly sad, and unable to motivate myself much at all. I have also been in and out of therapy for many years, but am not currently. Between the therapy and the hundreds os self-help books, I feel that further therapy is pointless. I think I have a good grasp of where my depression and lack of motivation came from, and what actions and thoughts would help. And yet here I am.I understand that thoughts and emotions are not the real me, that they are illusions created by the mask of this world which we mistake for reality. I believe that the Self is eternal, a manifestation of all of us, that the realized Self is pure Awareness, Peace, and Love.One would think this knowledge is the answer to all confusion, sadness, to all negativity. But here I find myself.","1"
"t feels weird even writing about it. I had still have- major depression during pretty much most of my life. It was bad. Very bad. But after several awful years I managed to have it under control during exactly ten years, this year will be my 11 depression free years. That means NO self harm or suicide thoughts or any of that pain that I used to feel. I felt normal again and I became an absolute guardian of my mental health, however, lately Ive been feeling that special kind of feeling that I so easily recognize, its hard to describe but I knew it was as if my depression was trying to creep up on me again. I guess it all started when someone I knew commited suicide earlier this year. We werent close at all but I felt the weight of his pain on my shoulders. Then another person I knew decided to end his life as well and then another. Anyways, The other day during this week I picked up my cat to pet him and later that evening I noticed I had a scratch on my arm, a scratch that looked very similar to my self harm wounds, and I think it triggered something in me. Instead of going for the alcohol and bandaid and to just shrug it off I fixated on it. It remined me how it used to look and feel to have such wound in my arm. oh god how it feels, Mmm how it feels, it was seducting and tempting and I caught myself on those feelings. I am able to recognize that I felt temptation to something that caused a lot of damaged to me and to those who surrounded me. I still fight with depression, I know. Its hard for me to not be in bed all day, its hard for me to wash the dishes, to clean my room, to open the courtains, to go to uni, to do laundry, to take a shower... I know it seems stupid but its debilitating to fight against these things every single day of my life. And now Im worried to come back to that horrible place that I once was. Im under a lot of pressure lately and I feel like everyone around me had forgotten that I still have this godamn illness, that these demons are just dormant but that they still exist, and that sometimes I just need support and space and forcing me to do things that Im simply unable to do is (...) I havent cried in god knows how long but today I have and its inevitable to be worried about where this is going. I caught myself today thinking that it would have been better if I... you know the rest of the sentence. I skiped uni today and had a family discussion and I just feel worse. I need tips on how to release stress, how to relieve anxiety. anything really. I used to write all the time but since I didnt need it I just stoped doing that.

"Hello all,I have been battling with some sort of depression for what seems like the last year or so (I would say forever, but things really started to hit me after a recent separation). I finally decided to make an appointment with a doctor to see if there is any medication I could be on to help me break out of it.Anyways, I am just curious what kind of information I can give the doctor that would hopefully help her in deciding what prescription I should try out (if any at all). With the many different kinds of depression, I am just wondering if there is more specific information I could give her to help in a diagnostic.Everything online just seems to go over the same things, but never really gets specific (lack of sleep, lack of energy, feeling of hopelessness, etc.) and essentially those online ""surveys"" (for lack of a better term), essentially say that if you say yes to any one of those you are depressed (without really going into much detail).I ask because I find it difficult to talk about these things in person with somebody, so maybe if I can be better prepared for my appointment I can give a better understanding of what I am going through.

"At what point did you feel you need medication? I have been diagnosed with depression and anxiety. Its been over 16 years since my initial diagnosis. I've been off and on medications. I haven't needed meds for the last 3 years, but due to some serious life changes, I'm really struggling to keep my head above water. My husband and I are both losing our jobs soon (we've known for 2 months) and are struggling to find work. I can find jobs, but they dont pay anywhere near what I'm being paid now. I cant just work 2 full time jobs because we have 2 kids that need to be taken to and from school and they are not old enough to be left home alone, at least not on a regular basis. The life changes should resolve soon, but I've been saying that for the last 2 months...things will get better... but they havent. I am stuck in the perpetual limbo of going nowhere. I am freaking out about finances, getting kids to and from school/extra curriculars, plus having someone take care of them in the evenings/weekends. We are already over our head financially which we have been slowly crawling out of debt, but now thats going to be impossible. I just feel so worthless, overwhelmed, and tired. I am having a hard time making decisions or even concentrating. It took me 3 tries to get lunch because I couldnt remember where I was going. I absolutely hate medications.

My best friend for 5 years that I've had a hopeless crush on that I have tried like hell to get over has treated me like absolute shit.

A year ago she pressured me to get clean which I am thankful for but then she got shitty with me because she wanted to buy pills off me.

"This is gonna be a bit of a long one but I feel like I need to talk about it. Ok so for starters to be totally transparent there were a lot of mistakes made on my side and stuff I never mentioned to my ex. She really did try to make things work but I almost feel like I sabotaged it on purpose. I mean I loved this girl like crazy, we pretty much grew up together. Went through all the awkward weird times and there were a ton of long walks with deep conversation. I guess the big part is it really was a toxic relationship after a certain point. We both got to be pretty unfaithful and I constantly hung it over her head. It's so dumb that I know how wrong it is now but back then I did it anyway because I was so tired of how my life was going. Well a little over 8 months ago she filed a PFA against me because like an insecure prick I tried to log onto her Facebook account because at the time we were going back and forth on so much crap. She was also interested in a guy she was going to college with and I knew about 2 times that they had sex. It broke me to hear that, it truly did. So my question being what do I even do to get over this. I've talked to my Therapist for a good while about how stuff is going and it's like when I leave there I'm good for about an hour and then its back to the subtle reminders and everything else.

"tldr: Would love to find someone I can video chat for 15 minutes every morning semi-early. Must be done over tea/coffee/breakfast, while dressed, sitting at a table. Positive and judgement-free check-in of goals/accomplishments from day before and current goals for the dayHi Reddit!I've recently slipped into a pretty severe bout of depression/PTSD and have not been handling it well. Almost 2 weeks straight of staying in bed, barely eating, crazily disrupted sleep, panic attacks, nightmares, hallucinations, you name it. Some days, I would go outside (briefly!) and feel panicked the whole time. I can share all the details of why, but I want to focus on this:The other day, I made an appointment with a locksmith for 8:30 in the morning. For two weeks straight, I hadn't been able to get out of bed....sometimes at all, but usually around 1pm, with my sleep schedule edging 'up' 2 hours or so each night. But when the locksmith came, something utterly magical happened. I live alone right now, so I had to get up and open the door for him. And I didn't want him to see me in pajamas, so I got dressed. And when I opened the front door, I realized that I might as well turn on the tea kettle and wake up, because I didn't want him to think poorly of me. Then I figured I might as well sit at the desk while waiting for the tea, as it was closer than my bed to the kettle. Then although I didn't feel like doing work, I thought as though I might as well continue to sit there (if only for show, and to drink my tea). Then, oh my goodness, the magic happened. I was sitting, dressed, awake, drinking amazing tea, in an area where I'm apparently coded to be productive, with social pressure to do so. The locksmith only stayed 15 minutes or so, but by the time he left I'd sat down and written a whole list of 'goals' for the day. And granted, this wasn't a ""miracle"", so many of these goals are things that are really only relatable when you're severely depressed: tiny, broken down, basic tenets of living, some of the more 'ambitious' parts of being an adult (logistics, namely). Like literally, ""drink tea"", ""make food for the week"", ""eat soup"", ""do laundry"", ""put laundry away"", ""meet roommate"", sometimes even broken down into smaller steps. Things I was beaming with pride over by the end of the day, and actually kept adding to the list, but also things I don't really want to share with someone who isn't going through (or has been through) this level of depression. I've also been in similar situations where my mind/body apparently function in the same way: I'll be working out, feeling very sluggish, lacking motivation, not wanting to do anything, not being able to do anything well. I'm actually fairly good at what I do, though, and am somewhat looked up to and have informally coached others. So what's been amazing, is that when I'm in this mood, sometimes I'll drag someone else to work out with me. And the second they join, it's like I ""jump into the role"" they're expecting me to play, or maybe it's the pressure, or maybe it's my pride. But I instantly jump into the 'coach' role, and then even if I don't want to do anything I know they're watching and I have to be a positive role model, so suddenly my body becomes very good at everything and I get excited to do my sets, and 9 times out of 10 I do double what I was planning on doing, and the person I'm coaching gets good training, encouragement, and 'inspiration' from the person who actually needed inspiration from them.Anyway, I'd like to try to apply this psychology to the depressive symptoms and 'cycle' I'm going through now. I would love to find an accountability partner, but in order for it to work I'd love to try to recreate the conditions that made it (accidentally) work so well yesterday. Maybe a 15 minute video chat every morning (strict time to make sure we both show up, kind of earlier, maybe 9 or 10am?) at a table with tea/coffee/breakfast. Where we have to literally show the other person that we are, indeed, dressed and either eating breakfast or drinking so we can't cheat. From there, maybe a brief discussion or check-in.... standup style. Showing or stating what we accomplished the day before, and what our plans are for the day.Is anyone game? Or, if not, any advice on where to find this? I think this would both really help me, and that I could be a good cheerleader and coach myself. I think the highest ideal would be to meet a friend for 15 minutes early morning in person or to share breakfast, but I'm a little short on friends right now and don't really want to share how depressed I truly am with just anybody.","1"

I should be excited about it but all I can think about right now is how I'm gonna be crying by myself in my bed again, but this time I'll really be alone. I really don't want to sleep alone tomorrow night and I wish I could invite a friend over to stay with me my first night in my new living place... but I can't. And today I found out my weight went down. I've been trying to gain weight, but since last Thursday I've lost 5 pounds and I'm actually annoyed about that. I haven't seen any of my friends in 3 weeks but I'm trying to hang out with a couple soon because I know being with them will make me feel better... but that feels so far away to me, and I hate being alone right now. I'm just so sad.I told my best friend about how I get sad at night and she thinks it's because of the birth control I'm on now... Depo-Provera. Maybe it is... idkI read that these things I'm experiencing are signs of depression, but I don't think they're concrete enough for me to think 100% that I'm getting depressed. It would be nice for me to know because then at least I'd have a reason for how sad I am.I also read that when someone's depressed they stop caring about anything, and I haven't been like that. Every day I go out and take care of certain things in my life that are important, and I care a lot and look forward to my future.Then I come home to bed...PS. I have ADHD and I'm on medication for it, ","1"

"My wife is running low on her antidepressants but whoever the doctor was that she went to didn't give her any refills on the prescription. I cannot afford to take her to the doctor. She has insurance but it is AWFUL. I wanted to put her on my insurance through my job but it costs SO much to have her on there that we would literally be homeless because of how much would come out of my check for insurance. I don't know what to do. She's running low and probably only has about two week's worth left. She thinks the only solution is to quit taking them cold turkey before she runs out. But of course this worsens her condition and makes things a lot more difficult for her and I. I don't know what to do. I just want her to be okay. What the fuck can I do?!","1"
"Ive been dealing with what I was pretty sure is depression for an extremely long time, but I havent been able to get help(I say havent but its more like I refuse to get help)Every time Ive come to a family member of friend asking for help, theyve either told me I cant be serious or that Im being dramatic and then got mad at me for talking about suicide, saying that youll end up in prison or a psychiatric ward for saying those things, dont let anyone hear you.Its really fucking with me in my head now. I cant tell if Im actually sad, or if Im just being dramatic. I dont even have faith in myself anymore. There are many examples from my life (so far) that I can say but Im just going to say one.I was talking to my mom(after having a particularly bad day) and decided that, fuck it, shes my mother shell listen to me seriously. I told her exactly how I felt, that I was just acting happy, that I was faking my laughs, that I couldnt cry. I told her everything, and yet she told me that I do this all the time, that I like being sad. I asked that maybe I should speak to a therapist, because I wanted to see if I need help, but then she told me that therapist just dig up things about yourself that dont actually make you sad to make you depressed. She told me that they dont help in any way. I cant talk to anyone anymore about my feelings, I shouldnt. Its just that every time I open up, I get the exact opposite of what I need;It just causes problems. I hate myself for days anytime I open up about my feelings, but I truly need to express them. At one point I was so stressed out that I bit my lip and scraped my pencil across my arm three times very quickly to bring myself out of having a panic attack in my Honors class. Luckily I was wearing red. I had to lie that my dog scratched me.I just feel so unstable, like I cant control what I do if I try to express myself, so I just dont. Ive started to express less and less. I havent cried in years, and Ive seen my close family members and pets die, I cant cry though. I can barely laugh at anything either, I know I should be laughing but I dont find anything funny anymore. I used to love reading and writing and drawing, but now anytime I have free time from school and studies I just sleep, I barely eat.I regularly forget to drink water and then almost pass out at tennis, I feel constantly sick, yet I have yet to tell anyone.Whenever I get mad it feels like I physically heat up that I cant  hold the words in my mouth and when I yell at someone I say stuff that I regret, I just cant  help it.I dont know whats going on.","1"
"Ugh, day 7 on 50 and I had a horrible bout of depression this morning. I just started crying out of nowhere, feeling like I was never gonna get better. I did some research, because I had to feel better somehow, and read that it can take 4-8 weeks to see positive effects after increasing a dose. Is this true? I can handle these feelings if it's just my brain getting used to the new dose but I wanted to be sure that that's true. The people were saying that around week 4 (this is day 32 on the meds, day 6 on the increased dose of 50 mg) they felt awful (which this technically is week 4 for me) so is that true? Is this depression just going to last through the next week or so and then taper off and I'll start feeling ""me"" again? I just wanted to check with someone/ others who have been here. Please do not give me negative feedback on how I should not be taking meds... I'm taking them. I've done hours of research to make this decision. I just want to know if this is normal/ if it's going to pass.","1"
"Idk if this is the right place to post. I have been experiencing severe anxiety and depression since my early teens, particularly social anxiety. I have had years of therapy, numerous therapists, support group, in and out patient groups. I have pushed friends away (not that I had many), and have a string of failed romantic relationships with guys running away when they start to see my panic attacks and self loathing. I try every day to meditate, eat healthy, stand up to self deprecating thoughts as well as try not to resist them. I cant deny I hate myself and people in general deep down, despite not wanting to. I think campaigns aimed around fighting stigma are ineffective and people look down on me, criticize me and bully me because of the thoughts inside my head.

"For a while now, I have been seemingly unable to feel stress. While this seems like it would be wonderful, the lack of any and all stress in my life is causing me to have very little motivation to do anything. I procrastinate all my work until right before it's due, sleep in too late, and generally act irresponsible.I'm not sure if I'm depressed. While I also seem to lack sadness and anger (a fact which I have no complaints about), I still feel positive emotions regularly, albeit more weakly than I used to.I think this whole stress thing may have started in the winter of my junior year of high school. I was more stressed than I had ever been before, so my theory is that I burned the ability to feel stress out of myself.So my question is: should I be worried about this? Also if you know a better subreddit to post this on please tell me.Thanks.","1"
"RATIONALIZED SUICIDE???I am 17. 18 in four months. I don't have a bad life, I'm privileged, I have a loving family and go to a good school, I have a few friends and am not bullied or anything. So my depression is just there, there's no reason for it other than me hating myself and the world and wanting die yada yada yada. I've struggled w self harm on and off for 5 years and I've been hospitalized twice. I've been taking antidepressants the whole time (along w other stuff for anxiety) and we keep switching and switching and nothing works. (I wait it out each time and give the meds enough time to start working if they're going to.) Basically, looking at my life from an objective perspective, I do not understand why taking my life would not be justified. (I 100% NEVER THINK SOMEONE SHOULD KILL THEMSELVES IM ONLY SPEAKING ABT ME) I have been miserable for these past 5 years and at times I've seen improvement but only enough for me to stop thinking about death 24/7, the depression has never lifted. I don't want to stay at home after I graduate. I don't want to go to college. I can't afford to get a place to stay. There is no situation I can imagine where I wouldn't be miserable. Everything could be JUST how I want it and I still would want to die. Rationally, it makes sense I'd want to kill myself. I just don't know what to do anymore.So this is actually serious, I'm not looking for attention, I'm not looking for you to try to talk me out of it. Pls skip the ""you have your whole life ahead of you"" and the rest of that clich, ineffective junk.TLTR: I've tried multiple treatments, been hospitalized twice, and have been miserable w little to no improvement so I feel as if it's logical for me to want to kill myself.ALSO I'm so sorry if this is triggering I don't want this to give anyone ideas about justified suicide","1"

"Hello,Everyday I am suffering and just wanting to die. My pain is so unreal that it makes me sick and so hard to wake up everyday. I am 22 years old and have been in therapy since I was 6, took medicine since I was 7, and been put in treatment centers from 13+. My family convinced me to go into treatment last year, so I did. It didn't help and they sent me the bill when it was my family who put me there. My father refuses to pay my bill and says I should make payments on it even though he said he was going to pay it, as he said the same on my college bill, which he never did. So, I am 22 years old filled with already bad credit. Oh, there is more. The reason why I am depressed is because when I was small, my father and mother had a horrible divorce and I was being molested by my grandfather from ages 3-13 years old. I told my mother, but she told me to stay away from him to just drop me off at his house everyday. I let this go on until I was 13 and couldn't take it anymore and knew it was going to get worse. Sometimes, I would offer him to touch me so he would give my sister food since he hated her. He got put in jail, but committed suicide in jail, so I never got justice for my abuse. I have nightmares every night. When my Grandfather died, my mother called me, my father and my step mother up and called us all murderers. Three weeks later, my Grandmother died from Ovarian cancer.When I was 16/17, I was in a school for kids with depression and was making progress in my recovery, for my dad and my step mom to send me to live back with my mom because they found old pills from years ago hiding in my pillow case because they were old depression medicine that made me sick and didn't help me. They made me puke, pass out out of nowhere, or made me really jittery and shake really badly. So, I am sent to live with my mother who had a shrine of my Grandfather on the top of her couch.I then started to date guys online that were inappropriate for me from being high ages than me because I just wanted a fatherly figure in my life. I just wanted a dad that loved me. My dad was always so distant and logical and never shown me emotion. Even hugging him was awkward. Then, I found this guy who is now my fiance. He is around my age because I decided I can't live those unhealthy age distance relationships. He made me so happy and my heart feel so warm. The only fault is that he lives in Trinidad and I live in the states, but we are planning for him to come live in the states with me, well I still think we are. A LOT of my happiness relies on him because nothing really brings me enjoyment anymore. I used to resort to anime or gaming when I am most down, but that doesn't even work anymore. I just recently moved in with HIS cousins in Florida and I have no one to cry to. I never want to press my problems on his family. Now, out of nowhere yesterday he blew up at me saying he hates how I am sometimes. I have bad habit of getting really angry at games and always feel I need to put in the last word because I never got justice in the past so I believe I am the only person who can bring justice for myself, so I feel this need to stick up for myself all the time. Now, he won't even speak to me and my heart is breaking. I feel I have nothing to make me happy anymore. I feel so broken. My brain and heart keep telling me to ""Kill yourself, _____. It will be doing everyone a favor.""They are coming more than anything. I don I am diagnosed with PTSD, Anxiety Disorder, and Major Depressive Disorder. ","1"

My only friends are distant but still here, which is great ! But sigh , I've never felt more alone. I mean, I want to be alone but physically in a good space, ...

"I shouldn't be surprised because he wasn't a good person when we first dated and I'm revisiting an ex. But I'm just baffled at how fast someone is to hurt you, to shit on your dreams and try to manipulate you. How fast they can drop you even after telling you they love you though now I think about it it was probably just so he could bone...but still...I feel like an idiot. Idk why this is a thing amongst guys I date. All of them have cheated, beaten me, manipulated me until they got bored. Taken all of my pain laughed at me...and I'm supposed to pick myself up again and keep going? I should've really killed myself when I was 11 if I knew what the next ten years would hold. I feel my heart literally tearing me up and I have no one to go to. My family abandoned me, my love life destroys me, my friends are non-existent until they need money or they only come over cuz they all look at me like a rebound chick cuz im ""hot and nice"" but I don't put out unless I'm in a relationship and in love. So they end up leaving my house upset cuz they didn't get pussy. And then I sit in my room like wtf do I act like a slut do I come off as one? I feel trapped in a loop of being treated like shit. I want to either do a bunch of drugs so I can forget everything and start over without so much pain from my past, my ex's, my family. Or kill myself because its immediate relief, and it's not like anyone would miss me they all ignored me when I reached out for help. Fuck I should've known revisiting this past relationship would fuck with me....I was feeling suicidal when we broke up just as I did when he cheated on me in our first relationship and tried to OD before...he would never care. Why did I do this to myself. What's fucking wrong with me. I hate being a caregiver....I hate being taken advantage of...I hate feeling stupid after trying to help someone with everything I have and then being shit on. I'm super shy and modest and stay in my room, I don't go out because I'm the only Spanish girl in my entire town...there's one black family down the street and everyone's extremely rich and stuck up and they all look at us wrong. I'm sick and chain-smoking and I want to lose my voice because that's how irrelevant I am to people they ignore me when I talk or talk over me even if they're asking me a question or talking to me directly. But they all talk about me behind my back and I hear it cuz I'm quiet...I hear how they view me it's kinda fucked cuz they never try to get to know me. Like you wouldn't call me a slut if you knew I was raped and I dont have sex outside of relationships and when I do have sex I panic and think I'm being raped so you always have to calm me down...but I'm a hoe that's cool. T_T you wouldn't say I was a bitch if you knew that I literally hate talking shit or arguing or even being mean unless you actually deserve it in my eyes. And even if you're my enemy if I ever saw you cry or hurt or upset I'd try to help you even if I didn't really want to I just morally can't sit aside and watch anyone hurt....I fucking give my money to everyone either in gifts or just cuz. But something somehow is wrong with me in everyone's eyes. People don't think like me I guess. Maybe I'm really alone. I just want to die. I feel lonely I'm too weird for everyone. ....when I was in Georgia I got really drunk and walked in front of cars to just end it...that was 2 months ago and I'm ashamed of it but honestly rn with all the shit between me and this guy yesterday has me wishing that truck hit me. Hit me really really hard and squished my brains all over the place T_T...","1"

"So hey, I'm a random lady at the age of 22 and I'm not sure what's going on in my life. For the past few months now I have been fighting these feelings of depression and misunderstanding frim a few people in my family. The reason is a little silly, I think. Buuut at the same time I don't? Hard to explain. See, huh, I, errr, got accepted to this REALLY good art school, and, well, I don't want to go there? I know, I should just NOT go, and I shouldn't be thinking about my own demise, but the facts are:- I'm not the one who applied, rather my mom's boyfriend did in my name behind my back- I sort of have a plan for my near future. I'm an aspiring voice actress, and I want to do that in my life. I'm working on my voice and acting, and might start to look for gigs soon in REAL STUDIOS :D (I practice and audition at home for small projects). I know you should always have something extra when you work at voice acting, and I DID think about art. Like, concept design, which is awesome.- I got accepted to another art school, well, art college? Art place where they give you courses? Anyway, I got in, trying to prove a point that I got accepted to the first place because they're desperate for students and not due to my ""talent""... I still say they're desperate for students. They second place is more expensive and doesn't give you a degree, but a piece of paper that says they're pros, hire them... Waaait isn't that an art degree aa well?- My family, or some of them, won't let it go. They don't get it, or want to hear me saying ""no"" and they keep saying ""huh, yes you will!""- This isn't the first time I'm feeling like this and fighting this.The reason for my feelings is really comming from the thought that the idea of me giving up and go hurts. My household used to be VERY abusive, and for me to avoid it, I would just give up what I wanted to do, or wear, or anything and do it. It sucked, and now that it happens again I can't stop remembering the feeling of giving up and overall ""badness"" (it's a word, I swear xD).I know no one is going to hurt me, but the feeling is there, and since it is, like, THE BEST ART SCHOOL IN THE UNIVERSE, or something, it's supposed to be the best thing ever and it will get me ANY JOB I WANT WHAOOOOO! Supposedly.That's one of the things my family keeps telling me, aaaand I highly doubt that. And I had a conversation about some stuff relating to it and that I want to go to the second place and they were all about how everyone in that place are a bunch of idiot that didn't get accepted to the first place and that nothing will come out of it if I go there and that I need to provide for myself and that the first place may be bad in my opinion but it still gives jobs. He's right, I'll have a great job as an ART TEACHER >:C not that it's a bad thing, I just don't want that. The conversation was so bad in my opinion I refused to tell them my plans (since I already did and not all of them are OK with the voice acting? They have mixed feelings), and began cutting myself mid conversation and had a total meltdown (the conversation was on phone). At the end we just awkwardly ended the conversation with ""think about it, ok, bye"". And now I do. What if I'm making a mistake, what if I'M a mistake, what of nothing will ever, ever, ever, comes out of me, am I going to stay strong or just give in and let someone in my family be all ""oh, yeah, my family member goes there, all thanks to ME!"", which is 99.99% the reason thet insist on me to go there, and that they will finally think I'm not useless and that now I'm just as good someone else.So, bottomline, since this is long and I might give you my tragic backstory by accident: I just want to dissappear from everything and everyone I know/jump off a building, and not give up.Just needed to let it all out. I don't want to worry my friends anymore, ESPECIALLY now that I cut myself.So thank you for taking the time to read this ^^","1"

I always had this problem, at some point, in past, I found myself happy about being alone (you know, that time that you really love because there is nobody and you have your own time) but now, what it represents to me is: ""Oh God, I really hate being alone"". Well, I better start explaining myself, sorry guys, I am also a guy who takes many different directions at a story. I knew this girl, lovely, sweet, quiet, at times very shy, even now I feel something about her, and this, I think is important because we were in relationship, more than a year, it was great and with conflicts (misunderstandings like ""what I tried to do was seen as bad thing"" or, mostly, problems about ourselves like our inner demons, also our young life, with little experience). We broke up, I never had a ""long"" relation like this, I grown to be a dependant person to her and making many of my decisions to her better good. I always thought that taking part ways was a better thing to do, but I was in ""love"" or, well, dependant. I couldn't say goodbye, very months later I find myself with a sorta relation of friends, being closer than normal friends but never couple. We have no ""intimate rigths"". I think I should say this before but our cultural context is in the North west of Mexico. Things do really develope different due to the place. But well, also the human behavior can be so similar or, better, experienced as same. I really look to her as a true girlfriend, trying to do better and better, but also failing greatly at it. I was so dependant to her that, in some manner of speaking, lose friends. Nowadays I am her friend, I consider myself as a failure doing friends and when she goes away I feel so lonely, frustrated, jealous about how she now spends more time with other people and I, I just can't handle it, I get so mad about it and I fear that at some point I am gonna lose it (I really don't want to be mad person, I mean, I don't want feel things like that, wants some peace) I don't know how to say goodbye, at times it seems she likes me tha way I do but a think things are getting worse. I'm still being like a leech. When is worse I become a sad bomb of bad habits and muddy humor. The very best representation of autodestructive person.","1"

"Hello, this is my first reddit post. I'm just going to describe my situation first in order to get some context for what I'm feeling. I'm 16 and in high school and I have a history of depression and anxiety. About 8 months go my mom divorced my stepdad because my former stepsister and my brother had sex. The reasons we're not clear, and I think she may have lured him in order to kick my family out. We moved into a new house, but ever since then I always get this feeling like I'm being watched. Things were pretty much stable for a good few months, I had a group of friends on discord that I talked too and played games with a lot. I even met my current girlfriend, who I've been dating for almost 5 months. However, things started to go downhill when 2 or my friends ( we'll call them A and B) started fighting with each other over a girl, (we'll call her C). B ended up with C and everyone started taking sides while I tried to stay neutral, but it didn't work out and they decided to be pansies and not try to resolve anything. I still talk to them individually but that comes in later. Then come the trust issues between me and my girlfriend. My ex used to cheat and I included that I have really bad anxiety, and my gf isn't an unhappy jealous fuck like me, so she shows affection to people, nothing to big, no kissing or anything just hugging and stuff, and being the jealous anxiety ridden fuck I am I think she's losing interest in me or is cheating on me even though she goes out of her to tell me I'm the best bf she's ever had and that she loves me. Eventually this jealousy led me to physically fight one of my ""friends"" because I thought he was trying to have relations with her. (idk if he was but he does have a reputation of doing shitty things like that) She said she never wanted to see me again and it all happened on her birthday. The next day she called me when I was at work and said she can't live without me. I couldn't either, so I decided to stay. However, she only recently apologized for what she did (left with a group of people who she knows are horrible and manipulative and will do anything for sex). It happened almost 2 months ago. Then I got fired from my job the next day. Then she announced she was moving back to her home town, which is 4 hours away. We're still dating and we facetime at least once a day. She may very well have cheated on me now that she lives down there now, but she will always say no. I also haven't had a job in almost 2 months despite looking everywhere. Both my divorced parents give horrible life advice that has never worked and my 13-year-old brother has just become a hyper-competitive overwatch player and a jake pauler. A lot of the people I hang out also turn out to be horrible people who only keep me around because I'm ""funny"" whatever the hell that means. I've tried to talk to a few close-ish friends about it but they just don't seem to get it. I did have a therapist, but I think I might need to be on medication, but I'm too shy to schedule another appointment because I've scheduled 2 others that I haven't shown up for because I either didn't have the energy or I needed to do job searching and schoolwork. And so here I am, just sitting in my on my computer for 8 hours a day playing FPS games and listening to music trying to find it in myself to leave the house without thinking about how goddamn sad I am and breaking down in tears. I also play my guitar every now and then, and that seems to help. I need a solution and I can't seem to find it on my own. I need something fresh, outside of the box. If you've read my stupid sob story all the way through I congratulate you. Any input or similar life stories that I might be able to benefit off of? Thanks so much for listening to me.","1"

"Hi. I feel lost in an ocean. My boyfriend suddenly said he wanted to take a break. Nothing seemed amiss. I thought we were both happy. I was going to propose to him next summer. We were going to move to Indianapolis together. Yesterday he said that he felt really heavy hearted and wanted to talk today. I know what's going to happen. I'm going to lose him and i dont know why. I know it isn't my fault but at the same time I feel like it is. I've seen struggling with depression for so long but he always made me feel happier and loved. Now I just feel like I don't belong. I am isolated. I can't do anything. I just stare at the ceiling and wish I would disappear. I can't eat. Can't sleep. Can't cry because I'm too dehydrated from crying. I feel so worthless and alone.","1"
"Recently, i started messaging a girl. She was cute, funny, independant...the perfect match for me.  I could not believe her and i matched. I had been so reserved but it was so natural talking to her.  She was my only reason for living as fucking dumb as that sounds...  Eventually after many discussions of cute dogs and everyday bullshit, she opened up to me.  We talked of her parents' divorce and her drug addicted family. (My parents also divorced).  She talked about her frined that committed suicide in front of her and depression.  (My ex girlfriend killed herself 2 years ago).  Long story short, i felt we connected. She grew up too fast and i had already experienced so much that i felt like i could handle anything life could throw at me.  Until now.  I had crushes in HS.  I had been infatuated with some women before but not like this...i thought i connected with this person...she said we can both be fucked up together...but that was a lie.  She was off to bigger and better things. She was going to get out of the abusive relationship she had with her parents by enlisting in the military. If i could have i would have enlisted with her. (I tore my ACL in April 2017).    What can I do? All i want to do is end it...put a bullet in my skull and call it a night...no one would care...she said it would be alright but it wont be...i know that...even as i type the rain falls like it knows i will not wake up tomorrow...if only that were true...  While meditating i asked that all her sorrow be transferred to me, that all the world's sorrow be transferred fo me...everyone else deserves to live. I dont.  I'm a nobody. A worthless pile of flesh...who am i to believe i can be loved...loved by a truely beautiful person inside and out.  If any good comes from my life, i hope that i can be an example...an example of a man too worthless to exist...i'm sorry...i'm sorry for existing and the waste of resourses i am. No good has ever come from my life...i only bring sorrow...  I consistantly wish that i would die of a horrible accident because i'm too cowardly to kill myself...even as i rant i know no one truly cares...you're all just light behind a screen...nothing compares to being worthless...","1"
"Hello all!Usually when my depression is back I have suicidal tendencies but lately I have felt the urge to hurt myself and it's concerning me.I noticed recently that I've been starting to like hurting myself when my depression flares up. Self harm, drinking too much until I throw up, revisiting incredibly painful memories, etc. When I noticed I actively wanted to hurt myself I got incredibly scared. I was wondering if anyone has any tips on what to do.","1"

"Two years ago I gave up on pretty much everything. I quit going to any of my engineering classes, I spent hours prepping for my decided suicide method just waiting for it all to be over. I stopped cleaning myself and brushing my teeth. I avoided all human contact. I dropped out of school/was kicked out. I spent a year at home working and doing decently well. I have a strong support system. I decided after a year I was ready to get back out there. I intended to go back to school that year, but I wound up just burning through my savings and being lazy. I got back to planning a suicide attempt, started taking care of myself less again, etc. After a year, I ended a crappy relationship that I was in for half of my depression. I moved out and got into school for music. I just noticed last night that I've been regularly brushing my teeth and showering without prompting for the past few weeks. I'm motivated to do my homework and clean my place and practice for hours a night. I realized this morning that I haven't considered suicide in like 5 or 6 months. I think I'm gonna make it guys! I know that it is hard to find hope guys. But it's there. You can all make it. I hope this helps someone somehow. ","1"
"Every night I find that I rarely think of anything of importance, I used to think philosophically and entertain myself. I feel like I have lost something along with my emotions. It has gotten to the point where I rarely ever feel anything when I'm depressed and I'm constantly stuck with these same thoughts of planning things out (which stresses me to an extent) and then the only thing that makes me comforted is when I think about what I could potentially dress like, do my makeup like..I have become shallow and dull with the brain of an old man with a permanent burnout, and I do excersize and eat healthy ..any advice?

"For the past few years Ive been dealing with pretty rough spells of depression that have lasted anywhere from a few weeks to around 6 months at a time. At first when I noticed that I was going through this, I just brushed it off as something that any highschool athlete would deal with like worrying about falling short and the disappointment of failure but I wasn't mature enough to adress the fact that my thoughts and feelings and occasional lack thereof was not normal. I'm starting to grow up now and I feel this is an issue that needs to be resolved. Everytime I start to go through a bout of dpression it gets worse and worse and it gets darker and darker and it's really becoming a problem for me and it's scaring me what thoughts, feelings and urges go through my head. Now, this isn't just some melancholic mindset of a kid who just desires more love and respect than what is necessary, this is a horrible feeling of dread and fatigue and anxiety that makes even the most enjoyable of activities seem unbearable and less favorable than staying to myself and shutting myself out from the world as opposed to the party animal that I turn into when I'm in a ""normal"" state of mind. I'm 19 and I still live with my parents and I'll be with them for about 6 more months so they're still a resource for me to seek help from, however, I don't feel they would take me seriously. I really feel like I need to get professional help and I know my parents love me and respect me but I also feel that if I went to them and told them that I needed help they would just brush it off and maybe even assume that I'm just seeking attention. My dad's been diagnosed with ptsd from his time overseas and my mom has had to deal with pretty severe anxiety and bipolar disorder ever since a young age. They both have spent time in a mental health clinic at one point in their lives.I don't know if including that information is helpful or not, I just put it in there. I came here to ask the opinions of people I don't know on how I should go about my problem.","1"

"hey umm. i'm fairly new to reddit so i'm not sure about how everything works. i hope i post this in the right place. i'm 17/f (is that relevant?) and i have depression and anxiety (probably more my therapist just hasn't figured it all out yet!) as of right now, i feel like i have no one. but i hve friends that have been with me for so long and help me with all my problems and constantly deal with how insecure i am and everything. on one hand i feel like they truly care about me and on the other hand i feel like they only stay friends with me so i don't get even more depressed. i also have a boyfriend. he has social anxiety and i'm one of the only people he talks to and i constantly blow up on him because i don't trust him even though he gives me every reason to. he always gives me reassurance when i need it and to be honest i can't believe he's stayed with me for as long as he has. we've been friends for a while so he knows how i am i still don't get why he wants to be with me. MAIN POINT:::!!!!!!I get in moods where i feel like no one truly cares for me and take it out on my friends and my boyfriend and i know it's just pushing them away from me more when all i want to do is bring them closer. i just need help please somebody i feel like i'm ruining my own life.

"Well everyone Ive been trying for so long to just swallow my depression but at this point I can no longer do so.. I'm constantly depressed.. The girl I was in love with broke up with me ""because we don't work out"" but I caught her cheating, lying, basically using me any chance she got.. At this point I'm still there for her like when she gets her anxiety attacks and she still messages me stuff saying I love you and miss you.. But when I asked if she's trying to date again she said ""we already talk about this we don't work out"" so it's just miss leading.. Making me feel she wants something but I guess nothing serious.. I'm not that way. If I'm talking to that person I'm trying to make it way past only a month or two. I was with this girl for over 4 years on and off.. And the reason we were on and off was cause she couldn't seem to stop lying and using me really. I guess it's my fault though for letting her take it this far this way.. And then I want to start school to stop feeling like such a waste.. But honestly I'm so depressed with life in general that at this point I don't even feel motivated to do anything.. I went through some serious things a few months back.. Part being me getting shot.. Wondering if I just got lucky or the guy couldn't aim.. But yeah don't wanna get too deep into that. And idk.. I see a lot of people starting all their things and I feel left behind.. I get nobody is supposed to hold my hand and walk me through it.. But through this blanket of darkness I can't see.. I can't seem to find the way.. I've even thought of smoking weed again but don't really like the thought of it because I'm trying to get a better job.. But at the same time it eased my mind so God damn much.. So idk.. I know a lot of people go through way worse than what I've been through but.. I never focused on much more than the stuff I mentioned.. So I feel it's just eating me alive at this point.. To anybody who reads this or bothers to reply. Thank you.. For taking time out of your day to do so. I'd like to wish everyone a good day. ","1"

"When I was nine I fell and hit my head which caused brain damage in my frontal lobe which caused BDD (body dysmorphic disorder), depression, and ADD (or at least something close enough to be ADD but isnt exactly). It was extremely bad until I was about 14 when it finally started to mellow out and turn into a bad month then good month sort of thing until finally it really started to become manageable at 16. I still take medicine and helps a ton with anxiety but otherwise Ive been really good compared to the early years.Im in college now and Ive actually had a pretty easy ride so far. I like my roommate, Im only taking 9 credits this semester (thank you amazing disability resource center), I havent had to deal with much homesickness, and I like my school. I have had quite a difficult time making friends but as long as I have my roommate to talk to Im usually fine. Everything seemed great now.A few weeks ago I missed my first class claiming to be sick simply because I didnt want to get out of bed. I also stopped going to club meetings that week. Then, a week ago I started missing more classes claiming to be sick. I figured missing just a few classes wouldnt hurt since we are technically allowed to miss three of each class.Last week my parents came to visit for parent weekend and it was good to see them but each night when I had to go back to my room Id become extremely sad. We also celebrated my birthday since they wouldnt make it to my real birthday. It was great and we had just a relaxing time in a tiny cabin they rented, but I realized that it was the very first birthday where I hadnt made a list of birthday present ideas for my family because I couldnt think of anything in I wanted for myself.This week is when it got bad. On Tuesday, I ended up missing two classes for the third time (the limit before your grade goes down a whole letter grade) so that I could finish a project due that day. Then Wednesday I missed my class of the day saying that I had food poisoning. Today (Thursday) I missed ALL 4 of my classes (including the two classes that I had already missed three of) and laid in bed all day watching YouTube videos trying to distract myself from the shame and regret. I asked my roommate if she could get me some food after her last class and pick up my mail downstairs and she agreed but instead she left to go home with a friend of hers.Through all this I thought I was ok, I thought it was just a little slump that I could get out of, I convinced myself that I actually am sick and that I really just need rest to get better... until I thought about it.I havent attended class regularly in a week, I havent showered in a week and a half, I havent left my dorm in 4 days, my room is so messy you can barely walk anywhere but I dont have any urge to clean, my favorite show is premiering tonight but I dont feel excited or care at all, and tomorrow Ill be alone on birthday because my roommate left me... and I dont even feel the urge to cry.Realizing this I feel almost worse than I did before because now I see that its likely this wont just be magically gone by tomorrow. My depression is back and I dont know how to deal with it, but if I dont do something soon Ill likely end up dropping out of college.tl;dr - My depression was gone but now - after missing classes, not showering for a week and a half, not leaving my dorm in days, and not caring that I'll be alone on my birthday tomorrow - I realize its back and I don't know how to handle it.","1"

Normal people can deal with confrontation, so why can't I? I just called my supervisor and apologized and very nearly told her that I have depression, but instead told her I am on new meds and am trying to find the right dose and it's throwing me off a bit. I told her I feel like a crazy person. She tried to reassure me, but at the end of the day, no one can. I just wish I didn't feel this way and could really use other people's thoughts.

"The time has come where I feel like I am going to break. I feel ever since I was a child I always had mild depression. My parents divorced, and I was an emotional teen. As I got older it got worse. Looking back at my high school days I wish I could go back and appreciate how easy things actually were. Now I am in my first semester of my third year of college majoring in Comp. Sci. I live with my single mom and her boyfriend. In many ways I feel tied down by them. I am 22. I dont make much money. I want to be more independent but it seems impossible for the near future. It makes me nervous and frustrated. I love my mother but she has been very mean lately. I also feel this extreme pressure to finish school as quickly as possible. I also have a small job on campus working for the IT department. I am at school most of the time and only get to see my BF about 3x/week. I dont know how I make time for these things as I still have to clean eat and sleep and do hw. I have been frustrated everyday to the point where my body physically makes me cry to ease myself. I feel I have always done everything right and obeyed my mom. I may have been that emotional teen but besides this I have never gotten into trouble or caught doing anything wrong. Now she has been putting so many restrictions on me and verbally putting me down. About how I am. She is generally being verbally abusive and she does not approve of my boyfriend.

"So now being a young adult that struggles with depression, memory loss, and ptsd I've always wondered where this came from. I had a hard childhood being at home, but about last week or so I realized that for about 3 years from ages 10-13 I was heavily influenced by an abusive pedophile thinking it was love. I feel ashamed for it, but also a victim. I can't even tell if what I went through is considered sexual abuse. I didn't know a thing, my mind was innocent, and he corrupted it. I was little, and he was old. What would you do if the first thing you loved (being at that age) would hurt themselves every time you didn't abide by their rules? Years later the trauma stays even with half of the memory being gone. I really wanna know if anyone has ever experienced this as well. ","1"

"Okay so I guess I'll start off with the fact that I am an adult. I have suffered with various mental health conditions as long as I can remember, including clinical depression, generalized anxiety, social anxiety, panic disorder and borderline personality disorder. I am being treated with Paxil and Klonopin as needed. My parents are nurses and are both well aware of my diagnosis. I try my best to be open with them and maintain a close relationship.However, recently things have started to go downhill. Particularly in the relationship between my father and I as I tend to confide in him more. Several events have occurred over the past few weeks. A breakup, my roommate bailing out on me leaving me pretty well screwed when it comes to rent and bill payments, and my cat having an accident where I feared the worst for him and which only made my financial situation worse. The way I reacted to these situations was a variation of negative thoughts, anxiety and outright panic. Where the depression comes in is in my father's seeming inability to understand why I react the way I do. Every conversation ends up with me feeling like garbage for having reacted the way I did due to statements like ""you know it's not helpful to react that way"" etc. Of course I am a generally rational person. I KNOW the way I react doesn't help the situation. I don't know what to do. I try to communicate to him why I react the way I do and the way he has made me feel because of it. It just seems to make him frustrated. I don't want my mental health to lead to a breakdown in the relationship between myself and my parents. Should I just not talk about it? I dearly wish I wasn't the way I am. When it comes to people dealing with me, most just choose not to speak to me anymore. I fear that the same may happen with my family.","1"
"My 30 yr old son has been fighting depression for over 10 years now.  We've gone through several suicide attempts (luckily none so severe that  they required medical care thankfully) and a few hospitalizations.  The past two years, and particular the past 10 months, have been especially difficult.  He has suffered loss after loss (several jobs, girlfriends, friends, etc.) and money problems - he feels like everything just keeps happening and he can't catch a break, catch a breath.  Several times this year he has called me in hysterics, sobbing to the point of me not being able to understand him.  He finally ended up in the hospital for a week in May and he finally agreed to begin medication and return to his counselor.  However, shit keeps happening (and granted, some of it is through his own fault/irresponsibility).  He feels like he can't take much more - and every call and text from him is making ME feel the same way.  I have dealt with depression myself and I have studied psychology so I have a very good understanding of this disease.  But right now, I am beside myself with my own pain (for which I am receiving counseling too).  As I said, every phone call or text I answer with dread - not only in mortal fear that he's about to ""do it"" this time, but even the fear and dread of hearing the pain he is in.  My heart is breaking, listening to him sob with utter despair.  Honestly, I can totally understand why he's so devastated - he has indeed had a horrible, horrible year.  Traumatic in fact.  And there's only so much I can do seeing as how he's an adult.  In the past I have gone to court to have him involuntarily committed - but when he gets into some of his depressive episodes, he cries out for help from me and his friends, but when we try to get him help (e.g. encouraging him to go to the hospital), he claims he's fine (like the time I had him involuntarily committed, he told the ER docs he was fine and because of a US law called HIPAA, (which guarantees the medical privacy of adults where no one can be told about their condition if the patient doesn't give express permission), I couldn't even stay at the hospital with him. That time - he wouldn't give the ER permission to talk to me OR allow me to talk to THEM to tell them all that had been happening up to that point. So, I do what I can to listen to him, provide support, a shoulder to cry on, gentle and appropriate advice when possible, encouragement to get help, etc.  But I also try to not give him a bunch of platitudes - dealing with depression myself, I fully understand that sometimes the only good thing you can do is say ""I hear you...I understand...and I'm sorry you're hurting"".  But it just seems so woefully inadequate.Honestly, all I've been thinking about this year is imagining how I will react if he finally does it...how I'll break the news to my 90 year old father and the rest of my family and friends...how I'll have to plan a funeral for my only child...what to do with his possession his apartment, etc.  They're awful and morbid thoughts, but they're there.  I go around with a constant knot in my stomach. Am I just preparing myself?  I sometimes feel like I'm dealing with an addict (he's not an addict, but it's similar in how he doesn't always want to help himself)...other times, its like dealing with someone that has a terminal illness - you get good news, then bad news, then good news, then something bad happens again and you're on edge, wondering if they'll get through this latest episode...and a small, dark part of you just wants them to maybe go after all ... just so that they won't be in so much pain anymore.  I feel awful having these thoughts!! It's torture.I'm just hurting so much because my baby is hurting so much.Do any parents out there have some coping mechanisms for me?  Any advice?  What else can I do?","1"
"Hello, I have been with serious problems. I took now a Lorazepam and I feel a bit more relaxed from the suicidal thoughts. But, I am still tired of what I have been through. I keep comparing myself to everyone, even my neighbours. I am everyday scared of going out of the house and seeing them. I pass through a school to get a bus and i feel like the kids are laughing of my appearance, just like my neighbours might be doing too. when i go visiting my grandparents in another country every year, my cousine is a problem. i compare myself to her a lot and i know she is way better. She studies, do not do any crazy things and its really racional and pretty, things i am not/do not do. my ex (first) bf is also there and i panic only to think about seeing him on the street. I take loads of psychiatric medication and i feel lack of energy, i feel compulsive and eat like crazy! I just brokeup with my last bf and I feel sad/alone/lost and my parents dont let me go out with other guys cause they are scared I will be in trouble. I dont have any money for now, not even my own home or a job, and i am 25 years old. Now things are getting better at this point cause I am having some help for that. But for now I do have to live with severe autistic sister, she is way difficult to deal/live with. My parents are getting way too stressed, my father eats to compansate and my mother has high blood pressure, and i think its because of my suicidal thoughts and troubles i have been through before. I am just a huge disappointment for everyone in the family, they still say they love me tho. I just wanted to know how to avoid suicidal thoughts in the meantime i live at home..please dont tell me to take a walk outside. I also keep looking at guys there and feel sad they dont care. its even worse. (and the girls are way prettier than I am, so no chances for me anyway) ","1"

"Ive been pretty damn depressed for the last 2 years.  Been depressed for the better part of the last 20yrs.  I have a lot of ups but they are short lived. Ive noticed today while kinda peaking in a depressed mood(dont want to do anything almost walked out on a good job cause of it.) that the last 2 months Ive been heading down the slippery slope again. I have all the things you need in life a good job, a reliable car that I have dumped some money into, a place to live thanks to my ex taking me in, food again thanks to my ex and I get to see my kids more often. But I cant stay remotely happy for more than a short time. A big boss got me to call a help line and will be getting some type of counseling free for a few times and he chatted with me for a bit. Didnt change my mood still wanna leave dont care about coming back. I cant keep myself happy or even content with things for long. Like now I just dont feel it. It frustrating! Im am a stressful by nature. And I can deal with that but this feeling of nothing, hopelessness I cant.  It beat me down every time. Like a 6yr old getting his butt kicked  by a 16yr old.(I know Ive been there).  Im hoping the counseling helps. Cause I dont know what to do.  Nothing works long for me. Gonna start keeping a journal but fear someone may read it. I am a private person unless you make me comfortable enough which is pretty rare. Only 3 people know about how I feel and 1 is my boss who just found out. Another is a friend who is always making me feel welcome. And lastly my ex who has been my rock for last 13yrs.  Even 2 yrs after getting divorced. Why does life have to suck so much. Depression has taken a few of my joys already including the ex. The battle will continue I only hope I can win it before my time come. ","1"
"My Nanna recently passed away, and her funeral is fast approaching and to be honest, I'm fucking scared. I have never really experienced a loss as big as this and I just don't know what to do. I feel like I haven't even grieved properly. I mean, I had a meltdown the day I heard the news, I threw everything within grasp and my roommates had to calm me down, but that's it. I don't know, I just feel kind of numb? Or like, I'm mentally pretending that it didn't happen, I'm not really sure. Either way, this is why I'm fucking terrified for the funeral because I think it will hit me like a brick wall. Part of me doesn't want to go, because I'm terrified, but I know it will be something I'll regret if I don't. ","1"

I've been doing Linux system admin type work for 10 years, but everything has turned into devops, and they want full blown automation/programming now.

"Hello, I'm a 36 year old male and I've been feeling down as of late. I struggle at times with even finding a reason to get up in the morning.

"Hi This past year has been pretty shitty. Usually, only some parts of my life are shitty but everything has come crashing down like the skyscrapers in inception. I've always been dealing with issues here and there, but this is something else. There is literally no aspect of my life that is not in complete turmoil right now, I don't know what to do. Usually, I sleep off the problems and combat them with a fresh mind, but this feeling is new.Its like my brain is silently screaming, all the time. Constant panic attacks, can't sleep, can't go out, overeat. I get this weird sensation like i'm this tiny microscopic piece of dust during my panic attacks. All of my motivation is gone, I can't bring myself to do anything - it's like i'm frozen. I don't see the point in anything, I want to close the curtains and fast forward to next year. I can't go on telling myself that this is temporary sadness or ""the time will pass"" because my situation is getting worse and worse. What do I do? ","1"

"I feel so lost, tired/exhausted, like I'm living a lie or there's no point.It started at summer, I was alone playing video games all day, would rarely go outside and desperate for friends. My friends forgot about my existance and would never invite me to things. I felt pissed off and alone. Fast forward, school began and I was and still am quiet, not that I'm shy but because I feel dead inside. I just, don't have any energy inside me or remember how it felt like being joyful, alive or happy.Hobbies? Yes I do have those, I workout, play the guitar, started a sport and a thing called NoFap but still no excitement or energy to enjoy these activities. Present day, I feel like i got a brain fog, lack of interest to anything, i have nothing to talk about with anyone, my life feels black and white, feeling like no one understands me, sociallizing is not interesting, i don't matter, i am always tired even after a good night's sleep, easily to get angry. I do have goals but I do them for myself, to become a better person, a routine that I gotta follow no matter what whether I feel like it or not. I lack feeling or expressing my emotions sometimes, like it was so easy and now I just can't. Sorry for writing like a 10 year old but I am just really desperate for advice. I am 16, can't afford a therpist or am i able to talk to my mom because she won't get me. I feel like killing myself but i won't do it, but that's just how i feel.

"My apologies if this sub is not the best place to post. If that is the case I'd really appreciate advice on an alternative.I have an 8 year old with a diagnosis of schizophrenia, depression with mixed features, anxiety, and PTSD. ADD too but that's hardly of any consequence at this point.We've finally begun meds and are currently on mirtazapine in the evening and Adderall. We'd hit a sweet spot on dosage and things were going well. Several times my daughter said to me with a smile how happy she was to be happy. She was still hallucinating, but felt strong enough to cope. Then the floor fell out.It started because, at least it seems, we increased the morning dose of addy. This made her really aggressive and angry so we dialed it back. Then it's as if the mirtazapine stopped working entirely. Once again my kid is spending her days either sobbing in a corner, screaming at friends and family, or having complete and utter anxiety fueled freak outs.I just got off the phone with the psychiatrist and we're going to take an extra half a mirtazapine each evening. But she said that if it doesn't work that we'll need to look into moving on to anti psychotics. Obviously I understand that we'll probably need to do that at some point, but it seems strange to me to jump straight from the first anxiety depression drug we try right to anti psychotics. So does anyone else have any experience with children and other medications? I'm curious what works or doesn't tend to work in kids and what to look up or discuss with the doctor when we see her again.Thanks in advance for any comments or advice.","1"
"Warning: Don't proceed if you don't want to cringe at my pathetic story or my terrible grammar because english is not my first language.We had been together for almost two years, a year and 11 months, to be precise. I know that it's a very short time compared to others, and I have to admit that it actually felt like a very short time too. She's the one who decided to leave me, telling me that I have to change first, before coming to her again. It's not the first time that she tried to leave me but I practically begged her to stay everytime it happened, and I think she has been holding herself up for quite some time, but maybe today was the last chance for me to change and I failed, pathetically.I know that I'm not a perfect human being and I make mistakes frequently, but there is this one mistake that I kept doing over and over again (at least that's what she said), and that's her main reason to leave me. Brace yourself because this might sounds silly and insignificant to you, but it's a major problem for her, and I respect that. The problem is, I tend to apologize to everything. Everytime we're having a fight, I always apologized first, and that's not because I want an easy way out, it's actually because I actually felt guilty and I honestly thought that I was wrong. But she always thinks that I apologized because I just want an easy way out, I tried to explain to her but she didn't buy it. She said that everytime I apologized to her, it feels like I'm saying that she's selfish and I just apologized because she's too selfish to realize her mistakes. But to be honest, it wasn't it.Long story short, after her first confession about her feelings everytime I apologize to her, I tried to change myself, I tried not to apologize to her by words as much as I can. Instead of apologizing, I tried to do something else to make her happy so that she would forgive me. I never did anything fancy, it's always been a small insignificant thing, like buying her a bar of white chocolate or taking her out to a movie, but it actually worked, and we were having a good time again.But, as I've already said before, I always repeat the same mistake over and over again, and when it happens, she will be extremely mad to me, saying that I'm a liar and I'll never change. It hurts me, to be honest, because she would never know that I always tried my best to refrain from making her feel selfish, every single day. I would try not to say sorry, apologizing, or any other words that might make her feel selfish. But sometimes, it just came out by accident, especially because we've been in a long distance relationship for about 3 months and it's really hard to make her forgive me if I'm so far from her because I'm not that creative, so I tend to repeat that mistake like saying ""I'm always wrong"". I actually said that today and I know it's a big mistake, but I was really confused when I said that and I didn't mean to make it sounds like she's a selfish person. Consequently, she became extremely mad, even after my explanation. She started saying things that she always said, like I'll never change and everything. But today, I tried to speak up what I've been holding up for months. I told her that it hurts me everytime she said those things, because it only means that she never realized nor appreciated all the things that I've done to change, and I said that a human needs time to completely change into something different, I told her that it's very hard to change instantly and for me it felt like impossible, but I've been trying. I feel really sad because she only notices it when I repeated that mistake, but not when I actually refrained from repeating that mistake.Anyway, she didn't agree to my opinion and she said that if I had a feeling for her, I would be able to change instantly, at the very first time that she told me about that. She believes that I don't have any feeling for her, and she said that I've ""never changed nor tried to change"" for her.That's the pathetic story of my life, and I've been really depressed since then. I know that it's not her fault. To be honest, I never think that she's wrong in any way, the only problem is that I can't be as good as she wants me to, and I just can't change as fast as she wants me to, she always said that other men will never do the things that I did to her and other men would change instantly if that man really loves her. I guess, I'm just not good enough for her and I accept that fact, I'm a terrible person, and just a worse version of the average men (she actually said that to me, and I think it's true).I have a lot of assignments due tomorrow but I just lost my motivation to do anything. The only thing that I've been doing is hoping that my mother wouldn't be too disappointed if I lose my scholarship in the near future due to my decreasing performance in this term. I'm sorry ma, I couldn't help it, at least not now.To those who actually read through my story, I would like to thank you. I don't really think that you can help me now because I don't even know what I need right now, but just letting out all of my thoughts and knowing that there's some people that knows about my problem feels a little good.P.S. I know that my grammars are messed up and my word choices are not the best. I swear that I'm not usually this bad, but I'm sorry, I just lost my ability to write in english properly, I guess. You are free to point out the mistakes and I might edit it, so other people won't cringe that much.","1"

A little back story on me: I'm a 20 years old female, I'm in my 3rd year of college but only have 2 years completed (I'll explain later) and   I hate my life half of the time. Growing up my father was emotional and physical abusive and I basically raised myself. I have a brother 5 years younger than me and I tried shielding him from everything but I could only do so much...There's no much to say but, life sucks. Im afraid of leaving my room half the time. I can barely leave my bed to even shower. If someone asks what is going on I just make up some lie. I've been told I have PTSD. I didn't know what PTSD was but the flashbacks and the random freak outs were not fun. I want to be normal. I want to be able just to leave my room and actually make friends. Friends I do have will make plans with my and I blow them off...And I hate that about myself.

"Two years ago, after my boyfriend and I had been dating for 8 months, he basically gave me up for his hand instead. For 6 months. I was really distraught over it, because I've been called ugly pretty much my entire life. Rejected by every guy I've ever been with, except him, up until that point. And I thought I was being the best girlfriend I could be. I always took him up on fulfilling his sexual desires, and I enjoyed every minute of it. I would have never turned him down. To be thrown away so casually by him pretty much destroyed me in every way. I no longer enjoy living. The end of the year is pretty hard for me, because, I remember every single day of those lonely 6 months. I remember what I watched on TV, what I ate, how long I worked out for, and mundane conversations at work. I remember it all because the days were slow, lonely, and boring without him. He didn't want anything to do with me. Just wanted me to make him dinner, and leave the room, so he could jerk off...So two years later, I've tried therapy, meds, more exercise, but I just can't shake this feeling of unattractiveness when I'm around him. He says he wasn't checked out, that he was just lazy, and selfish, and that he loves me and wants to get married to me. But, every day since I found out about his preference for skinny redheads with perky tits (I'm Black and really curvy), I've just felt like I can barely leave the bed. And I generally don't.I work three jobs and go to school full-time to take my mind off of things. I hardly eat, and have lost 20lbs. Most of the day I just think about how much better he'd be treating me if I was White, or if I was just generally prettier. The other parts of the day, I just cry. When I make an effort to make myself look nice, I get hit on by other guys. But it just makes me so bitter. Why can't MY OWN boyfriend find me attractive?? His approval is all I want, and I can't have it. It frustrates me SO much. I feel like I'm about to explode just typing this. Every time I see a girl with red hair, my mood tanks visibly. Because I know he's probably wishing he could be with her. None of this is rational, but I cannot shake it.Worse still, I moved 1,000 miles away from family to live with him (right around the time I was demoted from girlfriend to maid). They're always asking me when I can visit. I haven't seen them since I left nearly 2-3 years ago. I miss them all so much. But I can't leave, otherwise my boyfriend takes the first available opportunity to masturbate, even if I'm gone for 3 days. He's done this twice now. The first time, I left to see my dying grandfather for the last time. The second, I left because I found out he jerked off while I was seeing my grandpa. He jerked off then too. I went to visit my brother for all of 4 days and he couldn't even wait for me to leave. I checked the timestamps on the computer. Surprise, he jerked off the day I left, and then again while we were discussing whether or not I was going to leave him. I ended up going back to him. I wish with every fiber of my being that I hadn't. But I hated the city my brother lives in...Today is the 1 year anniversary of my grandfather's death. I couldn't go to his funeral, because I had a full on panic attack thinking that if I left I would have nothing to come back to. So I feel like I got no closure. All because my boyfriend cannot control himself for a week when it comes to porn, but he will turn me down harshly if I'm naked in front of him, and it's been 2 weeks since he's even looked in my direction. It's fucking unbearable.Is there any hope for me? Is every relationship going to be like this, because I'm Black and unattractive?? Is it worth it to break up and date someone only for them to move on to something prettier once they're bored with me? I just don't know. I am a mess at work writing this. But it's weighing on me so heavily I feel like I'm drowning in this overwhelming sea of emotion. Wtf do I do?? Do I just have to be skinny and perfect and get plastic surgery so guys will stop treating me like shit...?","1"
"The struggle is hard and Im finally coming to the point that Im not sure how many times I can do this. Am I better just working, sleeping... working, sleeping...So a little background might be in order. This is my first Reddit post, Ive been on the forums a lot and some of the things I read in the subreddit have actually helped me in my own struggles. For a while Ive been suffering with bad social anxiety and depression. Its been a up hill struggle. I couple of years ago I finally managed to get myself a solid friendship group and support within it to climb that ladder. I was finally starting to see light and become what felt amazing to me after a few long years in a loosing battle to my mental health. But this only lasted for about 6months. We finished my college and everyone just went of and did there own thing. Now they arent to blame as well thats what people do in life, it was the hurt that I lost my support and friends during this moment that knocked me back off my ladder. After spending another two years a down I started to get really bad, was like every living moment got to the point I was debating is it worth it. Whats the point in doing this Im just going to feel the same. The same shit, pointless position Ive been in. Wish I wasnt waking up in the morning, when I went to be I prayed for it to be the final night. For years I was in the position.My parents wasnt and still arent aware of the situation as they have bigger issues with my mothers mental health and the family situation I feel like Id be adding another burden to there already shit time. So I took my own life into my hand and Im trying to find my own support and keep my own footing.I finally late last year around July found a job, I became a care assistant. I was rather liking the job at first. Met some new people which was a great struggle even though the age group was soo different I felt like so comfortable. They made me feel like I was a part of this family on my first shift. No doubting if I was trustworthy or leaving me out because I was different or not apart of their group. I was welcomed in. I had found a place I enjoyed and it was actually work.This went on for a few months all the way to around February when people started to leave and loads on issues happened. Me and my best friend within the group had grown rather close. I told that person everything, we was inseparable. To this day she still is my best friend, but everything else has gone. People, the want and enjoyment of the work place. The start have turned rather nasty and the new staff we work with are lazy. Its just becoming very hard. I feel like my best friend is coming to the end of her patience and tether with me aswell. Like her replies are becoming less frequent, not talking as much and the like support seems to be fading and its starting to hurt. Im starting to feel alone again. I have no idea go to stop the slide, Im trying to dig my feet in but Im not sure its working.I honestly just want to be free of this rut, Im 20 years old, almost 21 and Im feeling like this. I wish I didnt but I have no control over it. I could be feeling okay one minute the next I just break down. I dont know how much longer I can hold myself together, keep putting one step in front of the other before I just decide to give up. The dreams and thoughts are coming back about not waking up. Im starting to do that stupid thing when you debate would anyone miss me, who actually cares about me. Its just all a mess and all mental pain in my head. I cant stand it, I would sooner have bones breaking in my body. Then waking up everyday and feeling this constant like mental barrier holding my brain in pain, distress. Almost like purgatory :( what do I do? ","1"

"Lately I have been feeling so lonely for some reason. I don't see why as nothing drastic has changed. I have a few friends but I am a ""do what you're doing"" kinda person so I am not the funnest person to be around but enough to throw some jokes and give some laughs. Its just hard meeting people when you stutter and don't have much to talk about yourself. It sucks feeling this way and I want to change. Any advice?","1"
"Im an 18 year old guy who suffers from depression and anxiety quite severely. Counselers and my ever so loving family havent been able to stop it. I cannot get motived to go to work or be around people unless im high. Even just the thought of being sober freaks me out. Everytime im sober Im rushed with all these differant sad emotions which then put me in a differant sad state of mind, and sometimes I uncontrallably shake. My self confidence has been shredded from the past over ex girlfriends, bad experiences and crimes Influenced over alcohol. I live in a really shitty city with a very high crime rate and no friends to relate to. I wanna live a happy normal life but the constant rush of negativity from everyone around me is making me even more depressed then before and instead of dealing with my problems I feel that I would be happier to just erase myself. As the middle child I have constantly been working very hard to succeed only to find failure over and over again. Does anyone have any advice on how to regain my mental state of mind? I cant simply just put the weed down but it feels like my only safe haven. ","1"
"Hey people. I don't know when it began, but... Lately I've felt depressed. I have no intent on self harm, but I just feel down. Everything that once was easy or fun just sounds like a hard and meaningless task. Anything I do wrong will be something that distracts me for a day or two. I haven't slept well for weeks or maybe months. I always feel tired. I've stopped eating as much. And when I was laying in my bed, I thought about how pointless I am. No matter what I do, in 500 years it won't matter. When that thought hit my brain, I stopped. I ran that through my head many times, and began to cry. I feel pointless. What do I do?","1"
"Hello, I am 25 years old. When I was 11 I was ugly. My hair was a reason for the entire school to laugh about. I can draw, and I was really innocent - so I thought ""I am gonna be famous and everyone is gonna love me or regret of what they just said about me"" - cause it seemed like they hated me so much (not just my appearance but also my personality) - I loved a boy but I was way too ugly for somebody to fall in love with me. The other girls were pretty tho. Then, I grew up, my hair changed too but I was 16 - and again fell in love with another boy - and this time he had a girlfriend, so no chances. But I would keep comparing myself to her and always feeling like she was way better. with 19 years old I didnt have a boyfriend, friends and was again, a reason for people to laugh about cause I didnt date anyone. With 20 I found a reciprocal love, and he decided to cheat on me later on. I am still depressed because none of my relashionships works, I dont like having friends cause they may ""steal my boyfriend""  and now I am just a loser on my art career cause I cant get up from the couch and do something about it. I still wish I was like this girl that my ex likes now and I wish I was as good as the other girls around. I wish I was recognized at least on social media, for my appearance or art, which I am not. really feel like my existence here is just useless in this world. I am just here cause I dont wanna disappoint my family or feel loads of pain if I may try to take my own life. Actually I wanted to be somebody in this planet and I wanna live, but I am way too lost. Someone give me so hope, please. I dont wanna feel alone anymore...I am way too bad for people to have something to do with me... ","1"

"Hi everyone, hoping everyone's fighting the good fight! ^^I posted here once before but I was in a bad place at the time and rambled without making any real point. At the moment after a turbulent year, I'm getting sense that far more in control of my thoughts and feelings but it's an extremely fragile state if that makes any sense? Last week for instance, I went for a mini break away on my own. Originally I was supposed to go with someone else but that fell through and ended up with me having to cut off contact with them due to their toxic nature. I was happy to get away from work and such but was nervous because...well...I was on my own.It was going well until I was in a museum and while I was there I had a silent panic attack that nearly put me on the floor. I was feeling ok after about 5-10 minutes but that really put a downer on the day.It got far worse at night however as I had trouble sleeping due to nightmares and I grew paranoid that something else was in the hotel room as well so I had to sleep with the lights on.The next morning was shaken up from the previous night and dipped back into old bulimia habits, mainly eating a ton and then making myself throw up. I got in touch with a friend later on in the day who talked me into calming down and to making a new doctor's appointment to talk about upping my zoloft dose or other options.  That was about a week ago and since then I had a week off work which was planned anyway and I'm feeling way better now. :DIt's just that now I've no real clue with what to do with myself now. I know I need to find a new job and find new friends since I had to let a few go recently, but I dont really know where to start either task.I kinda needed the space to vent out a few thoughts haha ","1"
"For the longest time I have struggled with anxiety. I realized lately that I lack any motivation and can't get anything done. I put off doing even the small stuff until it snowballs and ultimately derails any plans I have previously made. I like to live my life very structured and making my schedule makes me feel good. But when the time comes to do tasks, I'm more than happy to put stuff off until the last possible minute. I love to make music on my guitar, but I've convinced myself that I could never make it as a musician. I struggle in school because I tell myself that skipping class and ""relaxing and getting myself caught up"" is better for the future, but I end up doing it every week and never getting caught up. In fact I only get further behind. The main problem is I know all the problems I face but I can't seem to make myself fix them.  Anyone else feel any of this? Also any advice would be helpful. ","1"
"This is going to sound horrible, but I advice to kill myself. I'm not going to give reasons, because I don't see the point in doing so. I tried cutting my veins, but I couldn't handle the pain, and it seems it's one of the most painful way of dying anyway so this is out of the list.I tried sleeping pills also, but I slept for about 24 hours and woke up with a big headache. I'm not sure what I did wrong, but I think I just didn't take anough pills in a row. I can't be sure though, as I have literally no knowledges in that field and it's rather hard for me to find infos about it.I heard about nitrogen asphyxiation, that's supposed to be painless. Honestly I really love the fact that it's non-violent and painless (I'm a weak pussy) but I don't know where or how getting this thing. Nor even how I'm supposed to use it. I don't want to suffer, I just want to leave. So if any of you has any advice... And please spare me the ""go to the doctor, try to find someone to help you"" talk. If I'd want someone to tell me that, I would be talking to my family and friends right now.","1"

"My fellow researchers at Penn State University have created a free app called Mood Triggers that helps people identify things that can trigger their worry, panic, anxious feelings, or depressed moods.Features of Mood Triggers:Mood Triggers can help you keep a diary of:1. Your anxiety and depression in your daily life2. Health behaviors including your heart rate, number of steps, and sleep duration (all collected by the app)Mood Triggers can also figure out why you are anxious or depressed based on data in your daily life. Mood Triggers will use your own data and run statistical analyses on them to tell you what's associated with your anxiety and depression.I believe this could be useful for you. It's extremely private and you can work through it at your own pace without the judgment of others. I hope this helps.","1"
"So where do i start.Im a university student living in a first world country. I have a family that loves me, a couple of friends, a part time job with a decent pay and my studies are going well. In short my life is great. For some reason my brain doesnt get that. Im in this constant state of boredom and mild to moderate anxiety. Like i need to do something but i dont know what. Its better some days, worse others but always there. If i didnt have people tying me down i think id be reckless. Another thing ive noticed about the boredom is this weird brand of loneliness. Im not lonely. As i said my family ties are good and my friends keep in touch. However i find myself getting bored by people as well. I care about them but i dont ever miss them or look forward to hanging out with them, even when i havent seen them in a long time.I want to meet someone i genuinely like, someone more interesting. Im not talking about a romantic relationship, thats never really interested me, but a really close friend. Then again i also know that if i ever met a person like that i wouldnt feel worthy of knowing them. I wont go on a rant about my self esteem so lets end it here.Im interested to know if anyone else has had similar experiences because im kind of lost here.","1"

"Im a 25 year old, black and puerto rican man. I despise almost everything about my""self."" i wake up in the middle of the night almost every time. Whether its the asthma, night terrors, or the previous day's struggle, there's always something. I went to highschool in liberty sc. By this time in my life my self esteem wasnt where i thought it was going to be. I surrounded myself with the loudest most obnoxious people to distract myself away from my own insecurities. I didn't go out of my way to do extra activities or sports. Thinking back i guess i thought I wasnt worth the effort. I knew I could do well in track. I lacked that motivation throughout multiple areas of my life. I didnt date any girls because i was and still am socially awkward. I went to a Muslim school from 4th to 8th grade. While i did learn a bit about islam, it made me the most awkward person. Im trying to find a profound way of saying this but i can't. I was surrounded by too many weird people for too long. Its like i grew up in a different country. I was also abused physically and emotionally as a teen. My sperm doner decided i didnt deserve an abuse free childhood. My self esteem became this facade of ""yeah im fine."" A few years ago we found a home tape of me in 6th or 7th grade. I was documenting my science experiment on video. I just remember wishing that the confidence i portrayed before my depression would come back to me.  I was sure of myself. Now im afraid to get angry. Ill lose all sense of control. Fuck it this is making me upset. Im just gonna start standing up for myself and doing things for myself that put me in a better situation. No more standing still. I may have an expressionless face on, but there's a storm of self loathing thats about to get blasted off this miserable planet. ","1"

"Hello good people... I'm writing this as the last resort after a true hell of a year because, despite my and my family's and therapists' best efforts, the things have only got worse, and I have sunk into deep depression and almost completely lost hope and will to live, but am still very afraid to try suicide and still have a spark of hope that things could get better (but am afraid that I wouldn't hold on if they got even worse)...To start with, I had a very interesting and active life, had a lot of ups and downs but was overall very satisfied with myself and healthy, always enthusiastic and full of energy and will to overcome challenges. Than in 2014. I had a crises, which began with stomach problems following a depression, it was really bad for a short time, but this depression quickly got better, and with time I felt better and better, and after that I had a very good year, I even managed to find a girlfriend. At the end of 2015.I got stomach problems again, this time more severe (hiatal hernia), and I fell into mild depression because of that and overthinking/confusion what I wanted to do with my life, but still I didn't give up, I had great support of my girlfriend, friends and my parents and I could do some things that helped and soon things got better, and starting with summer I had probably the best time of my life, I improved myself and started fulfilling my potential, started having the life I was truly satisfied with and made progress in things I enjoyed doing, and was close to getting a job and moving away from my parents with my girlfriend...But than things started getting bad...First because I got into some bad company, and I started drinking alcohol almost every day and smoking weed, although I still took medicine (for stomach and a little dose of antidepressants as I still visited a psychiatrist), and that made me a little aggressive so I had some quarrels with my parents, friends and girlfriend, and felt a little worse again, so my therapist changed the therapy and gave me some sedatives...after that I felt a little better again, but soon, at the middle of December I started going down and had some moments of depression, which started increasing, mostly due to bad weather and these sedatives, which the doctor didn't want to remove from my therapy, and it only got worse, so in the middle of January i felt really down and apathetic and started having suicidal thoughts (and my stomach problems got worse again). Only my parents and my girlfriend were there for me and knew how i really felt, I saw few friends but usually avoided going out with them because I changed and became scared and anxious of things I enjoyed doing before, so I watched TV and moves mostly and walked in my place and slept a lot, and my therapist didn't help anymore so we decided to try a new one which helped my girlfriend's friend who was suicidal and in mental hospital...But, I couldn't get to him immediately, and I started thinking about death a lot in that period, and started feeling totally apathetic and hopeless so I started reading online how to kill myself and even planning to try that. Luckily, before I had the chance to try it, I visited that new therapist with my parents and when we all told him how I felt he said I should go to mental hospital nearby for a few weeks to have some analysis done, and I was really scared but agreed to go as I had nothing more to lose. When I went there, I felt even worse at the beginning because I was away from those few people who really loved me and I begged my parents to take me home when they would come to visit because I wanted to kill myself more than ever, but it was impossible, as the doctors didn't want to release me until I got better. I thought that it would never happen, but the therapy was changed and I started socializing with a few people there (and most of them were depressed so we had something in common), and after 3-4 weeks I felt a little better, I became a little more communicative and had some good moments, started feeling a little optimistic about the future again, and couldn't wait to be released to start with some activities that would get me out of depression (as then I felt as in 2014. thinking that I would feel better and better with time as I did back then). But after leaving hospital, I felt similar for a month, didn't find any activities except yoga (I applied for volunteering in several organizations but none called me), and soon my stomach problems deteriorated, and I became more depressed again with suicidal thoughts. I went to a doctor for stomach, and felt a little better again soon because of some friends, girlfriend and some books I found online for overcoming depression, but as soon as the improvement and new hope appeared, I started feeling worse again - I became too sleepy and tired, even though I slept good and a lot during night, I felt sleepy again almost every day after a few hours of getting up and I had to nap 2 times a day which really affected my plans, and after some time it got even worse - I felt tired as I haven't slept at all, all the time no matter how much I slept. I went to a doctor, who sent me to lots of analysis and they were all good, so they assumed it was all due to my anxiety and depression. Me and my parents decided that i should change a therapist, to start again with the one that helped in 2014 (I forgot to mention that I was really disappointed with the one my girlfriend recommended me, because he would only meet me for 10 minutes and didn't give me any advice and help at all, only changed the medicine I took), and in the meantime to try with some vitamins, which really did help and for a few days I felt better...But then constant sleepiness returned, which led me to greater anxiety and even a mild nervous breakdown...After more than a week, again came a few days of improvement, in which I could even sing and rap (which was one of my occupations before this depression) and I walked a lot and rode a bike and felt satisfied and hopeful again because of that. But after a week, sleepiness came again, and...IT STILL LASTS, even though I changed the doctor. At first I was really mad, I yelled and cried a lot in the mornings when I felt (and still feel) the worst, so sleepy I find it really hard to do even the simplest things as walking, and I started taking sedative medicine, which calmed me but made me even more apathetic. To add up, my girlfriend, whom I truly loved and had the greatest life moments with, left me, even though she said she would do everything to preserve our love, she didn't even remain my friend, only my parents, cousins and few friends are there for me, of whom only my mom and 1 real-life friend understand (or at least try to) how I feel, the others only make me more nervous with their advice when I try to talk with them about me; lately I found some people online via facebook groups that I chat with who understand and support me, so that gave me a little relief. And since the end of July, even though my doctor promised me improvement soon, and gave me 2 new anti-depressives, nothing has changed, I feel bad all of the time, I slept bad at night despite extreme sleepiness (some nights I could't even fall asleep), in the mornings I felt worse than when I go to bad, when I sleep for some more I feel a little better, but still sleepy and can't concentrate on things I liked doing and think clearly, the only things I can do are listening to music, watching movies and series, helping at housework and walking/riding a bike, and often I feel so sad when I think about my problems and feel pains that I don't feel energy and will to do even that so I just lay in bed with some soft music on. My stomach also hurts sometimes, I'm very anxious, overthink a lot and my eyes hurt all the time (which is said to be because of my anxiety). The therapist said that I have to avoid sleeping during day, which is impossible to me, I tried my best and I have to sleep for at least 1-2 hours to be able to do something, and he said I have to start going to lectures at my college as that would help my depression, and my parents and cousins insist on that too, but I feel unable to study and to follow them, and don't feel like socializing especially with new people (as I became very quiet and aloof, so I don't know how to do that). I had so many plans and dreams, I have great potential, and this whole year had been a nightmare and I couldn't fulfill any of them, and I tried my best just because I had hope I can LIVE again, not just agonize. I don't demand all the qualities I once had, I would be happy even if could be able to have one of them, to succeed in one area and to able to enjoy at least some things, but I'm totally sick and tired of feeling this way, nothing starts and motivates me anymore and I have nothing to look forward to when I feel this way all the time, despite all our efforts and giving all our money to doctors and medicine (despite our very bad financial situation). About 2 weeks ago I found some fb groups where I felt comfortable writing about my problems and feelings, and that gave me a new hope, but some days after that I started feeling even worse (like this whole year - whenever hope arises sometimes even worse happens and tears me apart!), in the beginning it was due to a virus but the virus is gone and I still feel this way, and I changed my therapist again and the therapy, so maybe that's the reason, but I feel really horrible (except maybe 1-2 hours a day when it's a little better so it becomes tolerable) and I started seriously considering suicide, so my only way is to try to find some help on the forums like this, because I can't take this much longer! I'm willing to see if this new therapy will bring any improvement, but if not the only option I see is hospital, but I really wouldn't like getting back to the one where I was despite getting better there earlier, and my parents say it's not manageable to go to some foreign one without first going here, so I don't know what to do, recently I've been having anxiety attacks every day and I feel like I'm going insane and like I'll never be OK anymore, I hardly even found a strength to write and post this here, and I'm obsessed with my problems and the pains I feel so I desperately need help before it's too late!","1"

"Hey guys. Im new to reddit, and this is my first post. I guess I kinda just wanted to vent about how Ive been feeling lately. I know Im not alone in feeling this way, but I feel completely and utterly alone in this world and like no one would truly care if I was gone. I have dreams from something that happened earlier this year, and my mind is constantly going to that. Its like its impossible for me to be happy. Im on meds, and Im about to start seeing a therapist, but a part of me feels hopeless about any of it working. I have plenty of people to talk to, but none of them really understand depression, which is fine, but makes it hard for me to open up about it. My cat is my biggest confidant, and my bed is where I hide. I just want to get back to a place where I dont wake up in the mornings already wishing the day to be over. I want to be happy with life, because its so short and could end at any moment but I just dont know how to get to that point. I often dont feel like Ill have a future, so theres nothing to look forward to. Also, curious question for others with depression. I sometimes get into this mode where all my emotions are like gone, except for anger and indifference. Like, my best friend could be telling me they want to die, and I wouldnt care. I hate it so much, when these moods happen. Does anyone else experience this? ","1"

She has been an alcoholic for the past 30 years, longer then i have been alive. i feel i contributed negatively towards that. i never helped her around the house, never did shit honestly, actually didnt do anything. i dont deserve her, i dont deserve anybody. i feel in one way or another i have ruined/destroyed all the people in my life, whether it be friends, acquaintances, or just ""random"" people. i dont have a relationship with my family as of late and my grandmother (moms mom) is a narcissist, honestly a stupid person. i feel i dont like taking advice and i boss try to control people (not in an extreme way) just always trying to get my way more if that makes sense. ive always been a good hearted person, never steal or hurt anybody, seriously. i dont know anymore. i think the point im trying to make is that im an evil person with a mask on.","1"
"I need a ""depression hobby"". I feel like my depression absolutely denies me from engaging in any of the skills I used to be good at and want to be good at. It's the fatigue, the anxiety, the lack of motivation and so on that really hinders working towards anything at all really. I've noticed the last few years go by and I haven't really gained any new skills and only regressed in old ones. What is a good hobby that I can work towards everyday that I can even do at my worst? Something that I can nibble away on even when I have zero passion for life, little less anything else. ","1"

"Hello, I really need somebody to talk to. I have exhausted my support systems but I feel that I am on the edge of completely giving up. I am a 26yr old female. I have a great life. I have my health, my loved ones are well, a good paying job at a nice company and a loving spouse. However, I feel like I live in a dark, deep hole and cannot escape. I have always struggled with anxiety and depression but never to this degree. I moved across the country to a new city in June. I had never left my friends and family until now. I am also very close with mom who lived next door to me. Since my move I have spiraled into a depression. First it started with anxiety then I finally went into a depersonalization and now I just feel hopeless. I am scared of myself. I am scared of being trapped inside my own mind. I feel like if I could overcome that then I could overcome my depression but I don't know how. I went to a GP and she prescribed me Zoloft. I have been taking 50mg daily for two months but other than calming my anxiety, I seem to be feeling worse. I cry nearly every day and I am consumed with my own thoughts. I exercise and try to stay busy... I feel like moving back home might cure some of this but my husband insists we have to stay put for at least a year. We don't have the funds to move back and he would lose his time he has put in at his job. I just don't know what else to do. My husband tries to be understanding but I can't keep bothering him with this. He is happy go lucky and deserves somebody who doesn't constantly bring him down. My mom has her own struggles so if I tell her about this, it will kill her. I can't live like this anymore. I have visuals of putting a gun in my mouth and pulling the trigger. I lay in bed at night and go over my suicide note. I want to live a normal life... I want to have children and die at a old age feeling like I lived a full life. Please help me. ","1"

"I'm an 18 year old girl that graduated high school back in June this year. I have been battling major anxiety, depression and self harm since I was 12. I quit self-harming a year ago, but I still have thoughts of relapsing all the time. I have also had suicidal thoughts ever since I was 14 and lately the thoughts have been getting worse and worse. I'm beginning to think of ways to just end it all or to just run away. Right now I'm living with my best friend's family and my boyfriend. And I just want to hide away all the time. I can't turn to my best friend for help because she's away at college and is always busy there. I can't turn to my boyfriend because he hasn't been happy with me lately. As of yesterday, he told me we need to take a break and doesn't want to talk to me for awhile. I've known him for almost 6 years now and have been dating him since May. Before we got together, we were great friends but ever since we got together, I have been getting angry/upset easily over just about everything, which of course hurts him. I don't know how to control my anger, I've tried venting in many other ways. Even so, he still wants to take a break to think about things but I don't know for how long. Which I feel as if taking a break means he doesn't love me anymore and doesn't want me, but he says that's not what a break is all about. The other problem is, before he decided to take a break, my depression has been at an all time low and I never got the chance to talk to him about it. And taking this break is just making me feel worse. I feel like if I try telling him that I've been suicidal for the past two weeks will just make him think I'm trying to guilt trip him. I don't know what to do. I feel empty. And last night when he said we are taking a break, it pushed me to my limits. I feel like I'm walking on thin ice right now and if one more thing goes wrong, I'm going to just fall apart. And who knows what will happen. Please help me. ","1"

"I'm just wondering how some of you started the process of taking action with your depression and/or anxiety. I've experienced a few traumatic events throughout my life and I think I've always known I've had some issues that stem from that, and I think I've always kind of known but I've never truly taken action. Sometime in middle school I was feeling really low and just wanted to stop living (not die, just stop living if that makes sense) and I tried to talk with my parents about it. They pretty much said that people who claim they want to kill themselves basically just need attention and I get plenty of attention so I shouldn't have anything to worry about. I guess I bought that because I just kept going, cycling in and out of a few really low times. Jump to high school and have a boyfriend who's super great but my friends are pretty shitty people and I still have this little cloud over my head that decides to unleash its wrath occasionally. My boyfriend was diagnosed with anxiety when he was a little younger and that opened the door to talk about mental health for me again. I started realizing finally that I wasn't the only one with my little cloud and that it might actually be a real thing, something I could actually be having an issue with. I starting looking for answers on my own, searching for remedies, lifestyle changes, and anything else I could do on my own to fix myself. I tried to talk with my parents a few more times, telling them I thought I was experiencing some depression and anxiety and they would just reply with something like ""oh you do put a lot of pressure on yourself with school"" or ""maybe you should try sleeping better."" I straight up said I wanted a therapist a few times and that was met with a conversation change or some herbal medicine my mom said was a mood booster. I would bring it up every once in a while, just bumping around mentally in the meantime. I'm now a freshman in college and I'm having my first cycling/spiraling period since moving out and I'm tired. I'm ready to take action and find someone to help me but I need it to be 100% free or something I can pay for with my minimum wage, low hour job. My family lives below the poverty line and we're already paying for college, I really can't tack on another bill. I also need it to not go on anything insurance-wise. I'm on my own with this and I want to do it alone. I know my parents, I really don't blame them for anything but we live in the Deep South, this isn't something they'll ever understand as real to me. So how do I get started? Where do I look for someone and what do I even say when I find somebody? How do I even say whats wrong? I don't even know how to describe it.","1"
"Hi, Im an 18 year old who just graduated and moved to Vegas with my dad, and two uncles. Now I know I dont have it as bad as most on this sub but ever since the move Ive felt lonely and depressed.

"(SUMMARY)No matter who you are, what you feel, what you did, what you experienced.. You are a person, and you deserve to feel love/happiness. I think I learned a few things that can fundamentally change your life for the better (and I hope this information will be as valuable for you as it was/is for me). Its a scientific fact that your brain can change in reaction to a change in your surroundings or a change within yourself. The following changes that you can voluntarily make, are all scientifically supported to have a positive neurological impact on your brain:Firstly: - Recognize that your feelings control your thoughts, but that your thoughts also control your feelings. Invest in yourself by breaking through the negative thought spiral and start adapting to a positive thought spiral.To make this process easier, fix your moods on a neurological level:- STOP: Smoking, drinking alcohol, using drugs, masturbating/watching porn for a while (90 days is advised). Cut down on sugars and drink lots of water. Reset your brain receptors (for explanation please read the full post)  and when you start to feel better find the balance that fits with your body.To substitute the cravings and withdrawal symptoms in the short term and (also) make you feel better for long term:- START: Physical exercising and deep breathing exercises. Start breathing properly/with your belly, eat healthier and take vitamin supplements (extra focus on magnesium and vitamine D).  Start becoming aware of reality and ALL its facets (see post).I hope applying this information will help you as much as it helped me. I'm convinced that the combination of these strategies can make the change.I wrote a full post with an in depth explanation and view of the summary. Since the amount of words is higher than Reddit allows me to post here (it's apr. 2520 words), I posted the full post on a blog I just made. You can read the full post here:http://sharesunsrescueplan.blogspot.nl/2017/08/sharesuns-rescue-plan.html","1"

"So I've been going through a rough patch for a few months now. Back in April I lost my home to fire. Not too long after that I was diagnosed with ptsd and it's done nothing but made a mess of my life. Not to long after that I was involved in two car accidents that didn't help with ptsd symptoms either. Two weeks ago things came to a head at my job where I had been going through so much work related stress and anxiety. I basically had to leave my job, because of the combination of all the stress in my life (managing symptoms and many traumatic experiences that followed afterwards) had pushed me to the point of self-harm and really severe suicidal thoughts. Luckily I had a few friends that were able to get me away from that thought and not have the urges anymore.So now my question, I still think I should have went inpatient at the psych ward it I'm strongly against pharmaceuticals ( I'm on Saint John's Wort and L-theanine to manage depression symptoms). I booked a plane ticket to visit family out in Alberta and planned on staying a couple of months while I recover. Do you think it was selfish of me to go this route weather than going to the hospital? I hit rock bottom and didn't really know what else to do?","1"
"First thing is first. Really appreciate everyone here attentively listening to those of us that might need or feel compelled to talk about their depression. Here's me: I've felt really down today and not much better when I woke up. First time, in about four months. Think I know why, but I'm too afraid to acknowledge it and instead have compounded things by going off social media for the past day only to lay in bed for the entire day watching Netflix. I'm in my final year at university. Have been in a very good, albeit care-free environment for the past five or so months - started volunteering for a national youth organization, travelled and met up with several friends along the way, won a national championship playing the sport I love - and now I'm faced with mounting priorities and this feeling of emptiness. I should embrace the uncertainty and tasks that lie ahead - specifically my dissertation - and yet, I'm too afraid to ask for help or even to start being productive. I have plans and aspirations, but they seem to be too many and I'm lost in my desire to also rekindle my love life. The latter should be an afterthought at this point, but I'm failing to make it one. TLDR; University and productive outlets of my time are being neglected because I'm too afraid to confront them. Pretty sure it's causing feelings of exasperation and hopelessness. Any help?","1"
"I am an amateur artist, and lately, I have been receiving quite a few commissions, but the problem is that sometimes (or somedays) I just don't feel in the mood for drawing/painting. Not at all.Some other times I feel that huge urge to just draw all day and night.How should I cope with it? Should I respect my body and mind and do it when I feel inspired, or should I force myself to produce?I've found that when I force things, they don't come out very well.I also have insomnia (I guess that is common in depression), and most of my ""drawing inspirations"" come at night when I should be sleeping. So usually I just draw and draw until I cant stay awake anymore and go to bed (around 4, 5 or 6 AM) and then sleep till 12 AM or so. But Lately I've been trying to adjust my bedtime so I can go to bed early to wake up early. But as I said, during the day I don't feel the urge to draw :(Please, any pieces of advice are welcome.Thank you very much.","1"
"I am a few months away from being 20 years old and I have no idea what the hell I am doing with my life. I dropped out of college and am working part time at a job I can partially stand but my life is starting to feel like a meme. I want to move to Los Angeles to pursue a music career but it just doesn't seem possible or logical to move. How will I afford to be on my own? How can I work 40 hours a week and take care of a needy dog and work on my music (my dog needs a ton of exercise and has separation anxiety AND a small bladder)? How can I find a job where I can work from home? Then why I try to figure this stuff out I just try to forget about moving and I occupy myself with other things like video games. I started to spend 5+ hours on the computer a day trying to escape the reality of being a nobody from somewhere trying to become a musician with nothing else to do. I stopped making as much music due to lack of motivation and energy. Writers block at its finest. I feel stuck in my childhood town and I really don't like this place (the people, nothing to do, etc.). Sometimes I talk about moving to Germany to go to college but the cycle continues of wondering how I would be able to take care of my awesome but needy dog and make enough money to put food on the table. I know it seems kind of funny to worry about these things since I'm so young but I'm worried I'm going to fuck up my life. I don't want to be someone that lives with their parents until they're 30 pursuing a dream that is just not able to be lived out. At the same time, I don't want to be that 30 year old sheep sitting at a fucking desk wanting the pull my eyes out of my head working for some dickhead wishing I had followed my dreams and stuck with music. This is the worst I have felt in a long time. I can hardly walk up and down stairs without getting winded and I have lost 20 pounds since I am hardly eating now since I am so nervous and I don't even have the motivation to make food.

I try to be the best I can be for everyone but everyone finds someone better.. first few times oh well but the next few hurt and then any time after I'll just cry myself to sleep while I bleed onto my bedsheets.. Well no I can't sleep anymore like me and my ex didn't leave on bad terms she had to figure stuff out like.. she is gonna come back after a long while (probably not).. but when my mind clears all I imagine is me killing myself and then her crying after and then doing something bad to herself... and I panic and this happens all the time now... it sucks when it happens in public cuz I start saying street signs out loud to stop it... but if I don't I scream and cry...

"My whole days just blur together. Its like Im watching my life from the outside. I have no control over it. No ability to change it. I can only watch as I continue to make these unhealthy decisions that lead me further and further down a path which is not my own.My name is Cody and I suffer from depression.I cannot remember the last time I was truly happy. Not just for a fleeting moment, or for a day, or week, but happy to where I knew the depression wouldnt slither its way back into my life. Happy to where I didnt worry when I went to bed if Id wake up the next day barely able to function. You see, this is the kind of happiness in which I seek. This is the kind of happiness in which I believe lifes meaning lies. Not all people who are happy have this, and not all people who are depressed accept this. Theyll see the week or two of happiness as getting better. I see it as a dream. I see it as a lie to myself that this could be the time in which I move past my depression.I havent always been this way. I used to be happy, and fun loving. I used to have goals and ambitions and a drive to accomplish things. Now my only drive is to make it to bed at a decent hour so I dont oversleep for work. My only goals are to not have a meltdown or fall apart in front of people. Im not suicidal. I wouldnt mind being dead, but I also have no interest in trying to be dead. Im not harmful. I wont go on a killing spree, or hurt myself. I think about suicide a lot. I think about the ways in which my life could end. Normal people would be driving to work daydreaming about what theyll have for lunch or do after work. I drive to work daydreaming about what would happen if that semi-truck hadnt stopped and had plowed into my car. I daydream about what would happen if I slipped and fell in the shower and drown. I dont find these daydreams unhealthy. Its just nice to explore what would happen.You see, depression is not the same for everyone. People always try to relate or find similarities. This is simply impossible. My depression is not the same as anyone elses and theirs the same as anyone elses. Its simple to understand really. I have my reasons for depression. Theyre not the same as someone being bullied, or whose parents are dead, or whose house burnt down. Why would those people and I have the same depression? We dont. Even 2 people being bullied, they may have some slight similarities but the depression is going to affect the differently.People want to treat this with medication, which infuriates me even more! How could a pill possibly change my life?! Youre not treating the problem, youre masking the symptoms. Its nave to think that medication can work on depression. Subject A is depressed because he cant find a job. Let us give him a pill and itll be better. Guess what? He still doesnt have a job! Yet they wonder why there are suicidal thoughts and tendencies with these medications. Youre not solving the problem of his depression. Its like rocket science I swear.I have friends. I have a wife. Theyre all there for me. I can reach out whenever I need to. I sleep next to my wife every night, and sometimes its the worst thing in the world. Why would I want to burden them with my killjoy attitude and thoughts? I feel like such a bad person asking my wife to make breakfast let alone deal with the fact that I often think of what life would be like for others without me around. Then there are the looks Id get. God knows my friends love me, but everyone would look at me differently if they knew what was going through my head.So what does it boil down to? Whats the fix for depression? I wish I had a simple answer. I wish I could close my eyes, open them and everything be okay. However I cannot. As for now, its one day at a time.","1"

Both my long term boyfriends are of Asian decent, they are suppose to want a family with me and settle down but instead both tossed me away pretty fast when what they perceived as better came along. I've been alone and crying for 1.5 years now, my mom committed suicide and my dad and my stepmom and my half brother prefers to live a life without interference from me. I really don't know what to live for anymore, anorexia, social anxiety...etc makes me wonder why really. How did my life turned out so messed up?","1"
"Like what even??? I didn't wake up or anything, I just felt a very severe anxiety attack in my dream. I'm on meds and hadn't had one in a while. Weirdest thing that ever happened to me. It felt so incredibly real.Is this like a thing? I'm lowkey freaking out.","1"
"So in a nutshell, I lost my job a couple weeks ago- just before my daughter went away to spend vacation with her dad. Since then I've been literally staying up every night until 4 or 5 am and not waking until 2pm at the earliest. I've been semi productive so trying not to beat myself up. My house is kind of clean and I've applied for jobs and I'm working on a business idea. But, my daughter is back in a couple of days and I need to get myself back in a normal life. Hasn't helped being completely broke. I've pretty much just stayed home as I can't afford to go anywhere. Any tips to reset schedule? I'm thinking maybe getting really old school antihistamines and taking them early (8 or 9pm) so I pass out and forcing myself to wake up at a socially acceptable time. ","1"
"So Ive finished one week of TMS therapy.  Ive had 6 sessions total.  I started on Thursday the 21st but missed my Monday appointment because I overslept.....So I havent noticed any changes.  My depression is still very present but I have started to develop some positivity and excitement towards my potential new life without being depressed.  You know, the same kind of hope you might get when you start on a new promising SSRI or something.....  So the Therapy itself is about 45 minutes a session.  You sit in a dentist type chair and have a little plastic box thing against the side of you head, above your temple, and it kind of shocks you... 40 shocks, 10 a second for 4 second intervals.  Shock isnt the best word to describe it.  Its a weird pulse but also getting tapped pretty hard on the head.  Like if a woodpecker was pecking at your head or something.  I dont know, its kind of weird.  It doesnt hurt, but you definitely have to get used to it.  Its somewhat uncomfortable at first, but after a few minutes it becomes tolerable.  So ya,  thats it so far.  Will give you all an update next week.   Hope you all are doing ok and holding on.  Depression sucks but we are all here for each other.  Stay strong!! ","1"
"I'm 38 this Nov and feel like I'm not going anywhere.It's been 3 years since I had to close my store that was turning a profit until I separated from my common law wife, was admitted to hospital and got electric shock therapy.Since having ECT I lost many of the skills I had acquired from school and work experience and eventually had to close the business.I lost my car to repossession, owe close to $50k and can't seem to get a job no matter how hard I try.I moved home to live with my parents so that I wouldn't be alone but it's like living in a cold war.I know my parents think I should be doing more with my time but I just don't have the motivation to even try.I live off a disability pension of less than $1100/month of which $600 goes to the folks for rent of the smallest room in the house while my younger brother pays the same and gets triple the space.I don't have any friends to speak of and rarely leave the house other than to buy groceries or doctors appointments.I was born partially blind and wear a prosthetic eye which makes me look cross eyed and feel ugly.I can't go back to school since I owe for student loans and can't afford to go bankrupt.Nobody wants to talk to me on the several dating apps I've tried and everyone I know on facebook are merely acquaintances.Even my cat who I raised from a kitten avoids me.I've attempted suicide many times, usually by overdosing on insulin and sleeping pills and have landed in the hospital a few times, just to get sent home within hours or a few days at the most.Nothing excites me anymore... I've been skydiving, scuba diving, hiked up mountains and been fortunate enough to have traveled parts of north America.I can't seem to find a reason to keep going on.I pray for death regularly.I don't expect anyone to care about my life but I just wanted to leave a little mark somewhere.","1"
"Hey guys. So Im not really sure what to do anymore, Ive been dealing with depression for about 8/9 years now and I feel like Ive hit the bottom. Things fluctuate a lot and sometimes Im happy as can be, but other times I feel like things couldnt get any worse. Im a senior in college and am supposed to be having the best years of my life, but I feel like Im completely wasting and them and going to look back on college with sadness and regret. I just feel alone all the time. I feel like I dont belong and that Im never a priority to anyone. I try to give everything I can in relationships, friendships, work, etc. but feel like Im just a second thought to everyone else. What else can I believe besides that Im just not good enough? Everyone else would be perfectly fine if I werent here, because Im not really important to anyone. And every time I try to talk to people about it I just feel like the biggest, emotionally draining burden. I dont know what to do anymore. I get in these depressive episodes and I try to seek help from friends or family, but end up just feeling more alone, annoying, and unwanted. So I guess I thought Id whine to you guys. Any advice/encouragement and positive stories of getting better would be much appreciated. Sending love to those willing to read and those who may feel the same.","1"
"I started college a little over a month ago and I just feel so alone and isolated. Everyone has friends except for me. I go to a small liberal arts school in rural Ohio that I was super excited to attend, but now all I want is to go back home and be with my family and friends. I thought that I would easily find a lot of people who are similar to me here, but I'm so painfully shy that it's extremely hard for me to reach out to new people and be my normal self around them instead of someone who is quiet and awkward. I made an effort within the first couple weeks to try and introduce myself to new people during orientation activities and my classes, but I'm so bad at keeping up conversations that nothing ever came out of it. As a result, I got extremely discouraged and stopped trying. I really hate myself for being so quiet, but at the same time I feel like there's nothing I can do to change it and I'm starting to lose hope. I want friends, but at the same time I just want to sit in my dorm room all day and cry.","1"
"I'm bipolar. I'm also generally depressed. My business has collapsed. Yesterday my wife served me with divorce papers.9 years ago, we moved to a state in the mid-west from the east coast because we wanted to raise our kids around family. I'm from the west coast and she's from here. So we moved here and had 3 kids.This year has been very tough for me with my moods. Marital problems and struggling to make a living have taken their toll. My moods have been all over the place, but I've been in therapy twice a week and consistent with my meds.Yesterday my wife filed for divorce. Yes we were having troubles, but this came as a total shock.So now I'm going to be living in a state I don't want to be in with a failed marriage and a failed business all alone. I have very few friends here. I'm going to be without my 3 kids, which is the biggest piece. She's using the bipolar against me in order to keep them.Am I suicidal right now? Close, but not at this point. But I can very easily see becoming so. ","1"
"I'm scared of the fact that my life will come to an end eventually and I don't want to die, nor do I want to live forever. Both concepts   are unbearable to think of and it hurts so bad. I've had this issue for over a decade now and I thought it was just a stage I was going through because it's not like if I'm the only person dying so I assumed that's how everyone else dealt with it. Turns out it isn't a stage and people say things such as, ""How can you be afraid of death if you won't be there to experience it"" or ""Just make the best of the life you got"", but it doesn't work and it hurts so bad. I lasted a few years before without this anxiety, but it came back recently and it's breaking me I wish I can just delete this thought from my mind and never be able to think about it again. Please help me.This feeling mostly happens at night and used to only happen before I go to sleep, but it's starting to take over my entire life. Day and NightEdit: I haven't been very active or social lately maybe socializing more and traveling would work. Just thinking about it eases my mind.Edit2: I'll return after a month if anyone cares and let you know how I feel after changing my Diet, Exercising, Socializing more, and fixing my sleeping schedule. If anyone else feels this way I advise you do the same. Better to try than not to. Maybe this can change how I feel about all this.","1"

"Most times, I feel like a drunken lost cause, in spite of the fact that I am gracious and kind and I feel like I'm a good person with a good job and good family and friendsAnd I know drinking doesn't control me, but it's a very good escape mechanism to quell thoughts in my head when I don't want to feel anything... And forget everything....I'm just a cunt. A low level dirty piece of trash that doesn't know how to value the life I have been given or how to love things that I can lose, given that possibilityI have a wall. I feel like an impenetrable wall, to allow myself to love another for fear of loss, after blazer.And it's sad that I probably will force myself to forget these thoughts in order to cope with day to day life.

"I don't want to be that person to ruin your day, so if this gonna make you sad or scared, don't read it.The last few days I can't get the idea of death out of my head. I was just chatting with my new roommate and that subject came in and since then it's just stuck in my head. Now all the things I'm doing are covered in that one thought, that we are all gonna die and we have no idea what's next when that happen. Maybe it's nothing, maybe it's another dimension, maybe we're just gonna get out of our bodies and keep carry on in new shape. I have no idea man, but for me it's terrifying and I just can't stop thinking about it. Depression is killing me. People around me try to be supportive about it but I know that no one wants to think about that stuff 'cause it's shitty for everybody. I guess I could just sign in for a therapy, but I know it's not going to change anything because people don't have answers that I need. My ex once told me that I should create my own vision of life and death to make it easy, that we should have our own vision inside our frame of mind. It's well said, but hard to do. It's all possible, and I don't know what to choose as an idea of possibility. My parents are very religious, so they already have their hope. My father is trying to convice me in that, but I just can't accept it. There are so much things that we need to discover and we should keep exploring I guess. I don't know what I was before I was born into this world, so that nothingness is maybe the answer. And it's a shitty one. I know that there will be hard times when I would probably want this life to come to an end, when people start to die around me. 'Cause that is the saddest thing ever for me. I also know that there are so many people out there wishing that they are dead and here I am so scared of that. I know that I know nothing and I just came here to try to write it out of my head 'cause it's start to feel like the world is spinning around and I can't do anything about it. I just wish I never had that conversation because it fucked me up, like a LOT.Two days ago I watched Forrest Gump for the first time, and I'm 22. Lol. The movie is amazing, but so god damn sad. And for the end, here's my favorite quote from it:""Momma always said dyin' was a part of life. I sure wish it wasn't."" ~ Forrest Gump","1"

"Basically what the title says... My girlfriend doesn't often go out to parties, she usually stays at home... Perfectly safe and drinks varying amounts not even very often. But it brings me down to horrible lows. I feel my heart race and it can stay like that for more than an hour. Even her talking about getting drunk makes me get this anxious feeling. She always asks why I feel like it... And honestly I don't know. Maybe because my parents used to drink and could become nasty but I was never hit or anything serious. I just don't know how to deal with how I feel because I want to be with her but it consumes a lot of my life. She has taken to hiding it from me. She did weed recently and was tried to hide it from me. I found out and weed basically gives me the same anxious reaction that alcohol does... Even though I've never actually been around someone smoking it. Which is why I find it confusing that it makes me depressed.Sorry for the long post. I just feel awful right now, sat at the foot of my bed at 3am. Have no idea how I'm going to get through tomorrow without tearing my arm up.

It was much easier to get out of bed knowing I was working not only for myself, but so me and my friends could live the life we wanted. One of those friends off-ed himself and since I moved back home (where the rent is good and free). And now I just cant bring myself to try to make money. Without my friends I have no reason to get out of bed. No reason to eat food.  Trying to Learning Power BI and Excel because those are good fields to get into. But I just cant pay attention.

"I don't really know where to start. I'm a 3rd year engineering student, I've been doing really well in school up to this point. I coasted through high school, but I was a major procrastinator. I had sports after school, then worked at night until about 9pm. I found myself going to bed as soon as I got home and getting up really early in the morning to do my homework. In college, I had more free time, but I could not focus unless I had adrenaline and caffeine pumping through my veins as the deadline approached. After a rough first year, I talked to my doctor and I was prescribed ADHD medication. For the first time my thoughts felt linear. Adderall did not give me more motivation, but I was finally able to see one thing at a time. My second year was fantastic. Over the summer, I traveled around the USA as a horse show groom for a number of trainers. I've always been passionate about horses, and being able to travel with some of the best trainers and horses in the world was an incredibly rewarding and eye opening experience. I learned a lot about aspects of training and horse business management, as well as about myself. I discovered that I want to work in the cut-throat horse industry much more than I want to have a stable engineering career. This scared me. I started booking myself more and more with trainers that are really hard to work for in the hopes that I'd wake up one day and hate it. Then I had to go back to school.Now I feel lost and lazy. Even with my medication, I can't find the motivation to study, or do homework. There was one day this semester (I'm 5 weeks in) that I started studying/ an assignment more than a few hours in advance. My grades are suffering and I honestly hate myself for it. I feel useless without being able to groom. At the same time, I am so thankful for making it so far into engineering school, it would be stupid to throw it away. I feel exhausted all the time, which makes sense because I worked myself to the ground this summer. I've been trying to not be lazy by having 3 part time jobs (totaling about 20-25 hours a week). I don't have a problem with these jobs, I just don't love them. I'm only posting my problems here because my friend took me to an on campus event where students talk about their mental health issue. I found myself relating to the students with depression and anxiety quite a bit. I know my father is extremely depressed and suicidal, but he firmly believes that depression isn't real. I've been raised to believe the same thing, even though as a 7-13 year old I recall locking myself in my room with a bag over my head and wanting to die. My mother was infuriated by my ""temper tantrums"" and I remember her screaming at me in the car threatening to take me to therapy because I was so unreasonable while I cried my eyes out. When I started spending more hours at my local horse barn, I became a lot happier. My parents never got along, they would always verbally fight. I remember my mother telling me ""Please be nice to your father, he didn't want to be a father."" Finances were never good either. I tried to make as much money as I could as a high school student to pay for extra things like my phone and car (as well as the horse habit). My parents paid for my living expenses through high school, which I feel incredibly guilty for. They would pull money out of their savings if I couldn't afford an insurance payment and they would buy me gifts on holidays. Now that I'm in college, I had my mother cosign on my loans. At one point, my mother caught me using the word ""fuck"" and I received a voicemail from her threatening to refuse to sign on any of my future loans. I believe I had a panic attack that day. I definitely owe my parents for raising me. They don't have any money to retire because they had to pay for a kid they didn't plan on having. My father was diagnosed with cancer about a year ago (I haven't been told what kind). He's had multiple surgeries (that I just found out about a week ago) and they all got charged to a credit card that I will need to pay off. Needless to say, I'm not happy that my father might be close to death. I wish I was told a bit more about his condition, but I guess it is not my problem. I don't really know where I am going with this. My issues do not exist compared to what people with real problems go through. Writing this has made me feel better (sorry I'm a bad writer), so I guess I'll post it. This is probably the most self centered thing I have done in my life, I just feel ""off"" right now. TLDR;3rd year engineering student has a passion for the horse industry but feels forced to pursue degree due to parental debt, and it would just be kind of stupid not to finish. I also think my childhood may have been a bit fucked up. Current feelings: lazy, exhausted, sad, lost.  ","1"

"I have suffered from depression most of my life. I am 32 years old. I was molested as a child, a victim of incest, and physically abused. For the past few years, I have been experiencing waves of shame that come out of nowhere. It seems to be getting worse. It would happen just after sex to randomly out of nowhere a couple of times a month and now its every day, throughout most of the day. It seems to subside when I am completely alone but when I am around people, especially my family or boyfriend, it becomes unbearable. I do not know if something is surfacing from childhood or if it is my SSRI medication. I can only describe it as being raped by your parent and then having to be around your parent afterward, pretending that nothing happened.

"I currently work a mediocre full time job and I am heading into my third year (and potentially last) year of community college. My main issue right now is due to the excess time I have on my hands since I am currently waiting for my last term to start and work only takes up 8 hours a day 5 days a week. This free time has given my depression a place to manifest itself since I have the time where I am not focusing on academics from the time I wake up to the time I go to sleep. So this is where my current issue starts, I have a huge project for my course that I have to do during this off time that will be due in January and requires regular checks with my instructor and a lot of independent work that I currently can't bring myself to do. I'm genuinly trying to push through it because I wan't to graduate on time with the rest of my class but I always find myself in a depressive state when I try to work on this project. This result in no progress and a constant feeling of failure that I can't break. This has lead me down the path of considering taking this year off school because I feel I will just burn myself out and end up failing anyway and wasting my money. This has also lead to me pushing myself to trying to actually do the project and get back to school since I think if I took the year off I would just do nothing with it and would end up feeling worse. I'm stuck in this constant struggle ruled by my depression that just doesn't stop and is causing me to feel worse as time goes on. I just feel so lost and helpless and talking about it to someone in person has just ended up in fights because I'm extremely bad with words and very few people I know actually recognize depression as an issue. I'm lost and I have no idea where to go with nay of this.","1"

Im a 29 year old gay male who has been dealing with depression ( never been officially diagnosed) for awhile now I guess. For the longest time I used alcohol and drugs to relieve myself, but about 7 months ago I gave them up because I realized I was doing more harm then good. I started hitting the gym and completely changed my lifestyle to feel better and it worked for awhile. For awhile I felt really good about myself especially about getting into shape. I also thought I met someone who was romantically interested in me as well. I had the unusual sense that my life was turning around for the better. I moved in with said romantic interest because it seemed like a good idea at the time. Fast Forward 3 months after evacuating the hurricane I visited home for the first time in years and then returned to South Florida with a weird depressing cloud over my head kind of like I realized I dont like myself or my life at all. Romantic interest started making me feel bad about myself almost like Im dumb. I dont really have the option of moving out at the moment.I realized how alone I am right now. I work in a restaurant that I used to love, but now the thought of serving tables makes me cry inside. I feel like nothing interests me anymore and then i get even more upset realizing I have no passion. I guess this post is a cry for help and sorry I know its a mess. I just really dont know where to start...","1"
"I went through a phase of heavily restricting my diet because I felt I wasn't good enough in anything, and the least thing I can do is to get slimmer and ""healthier"".  That worsened my depression. After a while, I couldn't take it and I started binge eating. I gained 5kg in two weeks and it is still going. It's been two months now.  Food makes me unreasonably happy and ecstatic but on the flip side, I'm even more depressed without food. I cry more and get agitated over every little thing, and whenever I eat, I gobble down more than three times the food than that I should have.  I've tried a lot of ways to curb my bulimic episodes but they've all failed miserably. What should I do?","1"
"So I have suffered with depression for over twelve months now. To say the least I have done a lot in that year, like becoming a graduate for example. My depression was brought on from a terrible breakup which isn't really a problem anymore, however I do still feel depressed.My depression seems to be rather confusing as I'm not sure why it seems to persist so much. I did however read that depression can occur around my age (23). I'm working hard to get my life back together but honestly some days it's like one step forward and three steps back, which only adds to the misery. However I do believe great things can happen at any time and things do change. I'm just worried, this year I seen my mental health deteriorate to its lowest, to a point I didn't think was possible for me. I just want to see my life come back together, see new opportunities and meet new people, but it's just not happening at the moment. Does this change?","1"
"So today I cut a bit on the tip of two of my fingers...umm that's true. It's not for the first time though,it started two years ago or maybe even before that. So basically I do it for preventing myself from a greater injury. It's kinda like I must have a minor self injury to control my emotions.I come from an overly conservative family. My parents are okay but my grandparents' attitudes towards me has always depressed me. They don't even let me touch the phone and even talk with my friends, like I'm not even allowed to watch tv peacefully. They just want me to sit with a book in my hand and study all through the day and to always stand first in exams. This excessive pressure on me sometimes makes me feel suffocated. Like I often get bipolar attacks. I may not look like it but inside I've a very sensitive mind. I tend to take in mind every single criticisms seriously or even a joke. I've been the first girl for 4 years but in the fifth year a turmoil in my home inflicted mental shocks on me which resulted in me standing 5th from 1st. Something happened that time which scarred my mind eternally. I'll never be the same person i used to be. It's been 2 years since then. I never stood 1st since then. As i said a vital piece of my mind had been snatched from me. My grandparents are desperate to bring me to that position. But I'm done explaining to them that I can't study like before. I do study promptly but i always stand 2nd. My parents are greatly disappointed. What should i be doing? If this keeps on going I've decided to end my life.","1"
"So I'm 16 a high school junior and i have a problem with talking to others about my emotional problems especially my anxiety and depression. I have never really spoken in depth about with many people outside of two of my closest friends and I don't feel like they understand. To deal with my depression I just take it and bottle it up but that doesn't work very long and as of late I have had the hardest time dealing with it. My grades in school are great best I've ever had in school but I find myself not enjoying myself whenever I play the video games I used to enjoy so much. So my question is how should I deal or talk about my depression with my friends and/or my family?","1"
"I make too much money to qualify for Medicaid and too little to afford to pay a psychiatric doctor. I know from my college years, and having been diagnosed then that I have major depression. This seems like a correct diagnosis to me, as I have deep depressive episodes, but never get the highs of bi-polar. I usually top out at mildly depressed.My problem has been a consistent failure to thrive. I have trouble holding a job, feel constantly worthless/guilty/meaningless. A lot of this stems from growing up as an adopted child with narcissistic parents. My twin also suffers similarly, and has at times self-medicated with heroin. I just want to get to a place where I can cope with things and start striving for a better life.... Right now I just feel trapped in a job I hate, with no sense of forward momentum. What do I do to learn coping skills? ","1"

"I really need help. This is getting in the way of my frickin life and I need to get back on track and get over this like NOW. I do not know how to get over this though! Please readWhenever I need to do something simple but important[to me], like school work, doing laundry, making appointments with my therapist, or even posting/asking something on reddit, I get what I think is anxiety, this weird feeling in my gut and my mind starts blocking thoughts I need to think - if that makes sense. Like ""thinker's block"" similar to ""writer's block"". I take, and have always taken, college seriously and I remind myself of this when this happens to me in attempt to do something college related outside of class but it still doesn't help. It is basically things that make me nervous and things that simply take time to do. Normally, I will somehow find a way to avoid it like checking some stupid social media for a notification or something or even staring into space! Sometimes I don't even notice myself doing this!! I'm only 19 and I have a love for academics that comes and goes, I have so much ahead of me, so many opportunities that I see and want to take but I just don't -- or I don't do what is needed to take those opportunities, even though I am totally capable of it. Why do I feel so horrible? Why is there so much overwhelm? I really just do NOT want to feel this way anymore. Please help.","1"

"I was diagnosed with clinical depression when I was 14, I'm now 21. It's been up and down but I've been spiraling again for a while now. I used to be able to fight it and pick myself up and do what I had to do to get better (therapy, yoga, meditation, spend time in nature, etc). I would just force myself no matter how badly I wanted to stay in bed. Now, though, i can't force it anymore. I feel like I have absolutely no hope or control. I met my fiance when I was on medication and at a high point. I thought I would continue to get better. He knew I had depression and anxiety because I'm very open about it, but he's totally neurotypical and had a hard time understanding, he still does, but he always tried. I was in an abusive relationship before him so I have a lot of anxiety and trust issues surrounding relationships. I always believed he would leave, but he never did, no matter how bad I got or how hard things were. He was so supportive, always reassuring me, always telling me it's okay to be sad, always willing to listen, encouraging me not to fake happiness for his sake. As I spiraled further downward, that changed. He said ""this isn't what I signed up for,"" and ""I didn't know that it would get this bad when I told you I'd always be there for you.""He stopped being interested in sex, stopped wanting to spend a lot of time together, stopped talking about our future or reassuring me. He started to get angry and annoyed at me for feeling this way. This weekend he took back the ring and said he couldn't do it anymore, that my unhappiness was making him unhappy. My world came crashing down around me. We've always been a team, always said we would make it work no matter what. I now hate myself, feel worthless, resent my illness, resent myself, just spiraling further. He's the best thing that's ever happened to me. I can't lose him to this. He came around and apologized, but we're still broken. He asked me not to initiate sex and if I could let him sleep with other people. I can't even type that without wanting to vomit. He gave the ring back again but my anxiety is through the roof now, debilitating, I've been unable to sleep and throwing up. It was easier to deal with the fact that he might leave me before I became attached to him and our future together. Now I feel that if he were to leave or cheat I am not strong enough to get through it. Can anyone relate? Is it just my depression telling me he doesn't love me anymore, that there's no hope for me or for us? I feel so empty, so heavy, so heartbroken. How can I get through this without him feeling my unhappiness? How can I fix me, fix us?","1"

"Lately things have been very hectic in terms of waking up each day wondering if I am worth being a human being in this cruel world. Lets start off by stating that I started to become depressed around my teens due to abusive relationships, family problems regarding infidelity, and everyone dismissing that I suffer depression. My family thinks I'm rebellious but in reality I am crying out for help. I always have to be a mom to my sister when my parents fight and it backfires at times when my sister insults me and tells me to back off. Then there is my boyfriend well...maybe ex boyfriend. I saw him as my source of security, he was very understanding and then out of nowhere he started to tell me to toughen up and stop sobbing. ""Life doesn't revolve just around you kim, you're so spoiled and absolutely sensitive"" yeah...those words? He knows my dark past and what I am going through and he still had the audacity to say that and I still was understanding towards his reaction. I actually forgave him when he came back crying sorry. Off we went and he was charming all over again and then suddenly he just went off again. I went with him Friday on a date and he was super weird. He kept joking around and I kindly texted him that I was upset because I haven't eaten and I feel down and to pls take me seriously. He was bitter but accepted. As soon as we get to the station I thought... ""you know what I need to be a good gf"" and I fluttered kisses on his cheeks and hugged him and he cut me off saying to not talk until I get over my attitude and eat. (Which pissed me off when I already displayed affection) On the train he was physically affectionate but his face displayed no warmth it was cold and still and he would laugh and I would ask and nothing...he would not answer me. We get to the restaurant and he tried to be nice but I was hurt and then he tells me about how I need to follow my goal which is eating healthy, as I wanted, and he was not happy at how I ate horribly this week. I said ok and Boom all my insecurities came present as if I was sitting with my demons at this dinner rather than myself and my bf. I obviously showed discomfort because I have low self-esteem and long story short we left the sushi place and I told him whats his issue and why isn't he emotionally connected like before. ""Kim honestly I am so burnt out with your emotions, I was understanding before cause I was new to the whole thing. But now? I already know what to expect when your depressed and I am done!"" I proceeded to tell him to leave me if he doesn't love me or want me for ME and he just kept ignoring and saying lets go home. I cried out how I don't want to be with him cause he is not accepting me and that he is exactly like my exes that they leave as soon as things get real and tough. Then he blankly stared right into my face and said ""OK I am done, you're right I don't want to continue, I am done! you're the only good person who knows how to deal with me but, I cant deal with you soooo let me drop you home so your parents doesn't worry."" I told him to leave and if he decided to leave me to not look for me for reconciliation (because I had remorse to hear what he said to me and wanted him to know how he really was hurting me). I said it in hopes he would come to realization with what he was really saying to his very loving gf. To not make it long...I actually walked away and went to the mall all by myself to calm down and get home.I got home and passed out and since then I messaged him if he really meant what he said and no answer, I called twice to clear things out and no answer...and I told him how I have faith in us but I guess he doesn't care and I would stop humiliating myself. Its Monday and still no reply and I don't know what to do or think cause he normally seeks reconciliation and will try to fix his mistakes but he disappeared in thin air. I haven't told anyone to avoid the drama if this issue gets resolved and I do decide to get back. I don't know if I should take his break up serious or even go back if he does regret what he did. I seriously am very lost and feel stupid, severely depressed but still putting on a kind face to my work and school. HELP!","1"
"I (F:22) have been depressed for years. I had an ugly childhood getting beat by my dad and watching him beat my mom. I grew up with his anger issues and over the time, I grew depressed and also think his anger stuck on me. I got in a relationship with a drug addict(M:25) 3 years ago and have a child together. He put me through some horrible shit first 2 years and now he's almost a year sober..but I have these fits. Awful rage fits. Where I don't say what bothers me but when I get some alcohol in me, I'll instigate a fight and get very violent. I already have a domestic battery a few months ago. I don't know what to do to fix me. I love him but I hate not being able to get over what he's done and I hate breaking shit and hitting him. For quite some time, he lost his sex drive and hasn't been frisky with me either. I still have mine and try to get him to do anything with me only to get shut down.

"I am a 29 yo in the Navy.  Ever since I joined I've been screwed over by the military changing my career path to something I really detest, maintenance.  I've been feeling an overwhelming weight of depression ever since they put me in this career field.  I've been doing my best to coup with this life career change, thinking that maybe if I give it a try I'll enjoy maintenance.  I did really well in school and have been recognized by my superiors of my skills.  Even with the recognition, I feel like an empty shell just counting down the time until I'm out or to croak over dead.  I am seeing a therapist about my depression and other health problems that occurred while I am a maintainer.  With the different session if feels like they just say the same thing over and over and I am getting nowhere with my life.  I've tried doing things I really loved and get no joy out of it anymore.  Anything I do is forced and I feel nothing is ever getting better.  Recently I have been transferred to admin which I enjoy more than maintenance, but I still feel empty and wanting everything just to stop.  I also took a three weeks vacation to visit my family and I felt I was forcing everything to keep them from knowing exactly what I am feeling.I have not planned on killing myself or doing anything too rash, it's just I'm at the point where I don't care what happens anymore and if I die, I die.  I really don't know what to do anymore.  Only thing I want right now is for my life to just end through some random event that occurs.","1"

"I'm new to the boards but I've been a treating psychiatrist for over 10 years and I'm happy to answer questions.  I utilize genetic testing in my office as well as Ketamine for treatment resistant depression and anxiety.  I believe in talk therapy in addition to meds (if necessary) and think that nutrition also plays a huge role in our mood, energy, sleep, etc.  If you're struggling with depression it can get better if you find someone who can work with you to figure out what has caused the depression and then helps you get well.  It will take time but your inner strength will prevail.  My practice website is wwe.ketamineontario.com where you can drop me a line.  ","1"

"Hey everyone! I'm looking for advice from others in the same horrible depression boat as me! Lol. Here it goes: I'm 29 and have a job that I've done for 4 years. It's a very easy job with little to no stress, sounds great right? It's horrible. I feel like Ive gotten comfortable at the job and I'm finding it insanely difficult to try something else. I want to develop more but just can't seem to uproot myself. Change is horrific in my mind. I'm seeing a therapist. The job is basically driving around all day to check meters, occasionally operate a forklift..,and that's it. It's at a university so I get a great tuition discount which I never use cause I'm so depressed. I feel like I've wasted time. They have a few trainings a year but there is no way to move up in the company. I've stayed there because it was a non stressful job for me who is always stressed anyway. People always say I'm so lucky to have that job. It's misery. 40hrs a week checking meters, not fulfilling at all, but no boss breathing down your neck, extra breaks, longer lunches and paid time off whenever really. I've always wanted to persue art. I have an associates degree and about 12,000 in the bank with no debt and I hate my life. Crazy right? I know I'm somewhat lucky but I'm so upset. No girlfriend, I live alone and I'm stuck with depressive chains tightening. My parents want me to quit my job and move home cause they're so worried about me. They think I should persue art at a junior college for fun, and not to try and make a living at it. I'm so afraid to try, the fear has taken over and held me here. What would you do if you were in my position? ","1"
"I've never posted on reddit before but here i go. I was with this girl, idk if i should use past tense just yet though, and we been togeather for about 5 months now. Before her i was alone for 2 years and before that i was abused for 6 with my ex. This girl CHANGED my life. Sure we fight alot alot, but over all she looks at me, treats me, and talks about me like im a king. My entire life has changed, im more confident in everything i do, i feel so loved beyond words. I helped her move upstate, a 11 hr bus ride each way. She dorms up in geneseo ny, i live in brooklyn. I bought her the world even though she never asked for a single dollar. I gave her love that i havent given anyone in years. She single handedly cured my depression that i been suffering for 9 years now.On my 2nd trip up there to see her, i get back home and have this funny feeling. A few days before she accused me of cheating (she always does it, apperently her ex's cheated on her etc and shes paranoid) but this time was different. She snatched my phone and started looking for vids and pics of her self and others. I was taken back, im not the type of guy to do that shit. So during the entire 11 hr bus ride back i had the weirdest feeling... i had nothing to watch or do but think. I finally get home after almost getting mugged at 3 am in the train station, and decided to check the internet. What are the chances???? WHAT ARE THE CHANCES?? the 5th fucking page of xvideos shes there sucking a guys dickWithout a doubt it was revenge porn. Clear as day. Its horrible, beyond horrible, my heart was broken. I showed my best friend who knew her for almost as long as i did and he was speechless.I droped to the floor and wept. My entire body was like shivering and i couldnt move or do anything...I finally get up and ask her... wtf??First she denies it, then accecpts it, then says she doesnt know if its her. I bug out and ask how she didnt know and how many dicks she sucked to not know ( im a dick sometimes. I appologize) and she kept continuing to deny accecpt and misdirect my question. She must have been shocked and repulsed, she was going crazy, got kicked out of class and sent to the mental health dept. Let it be known: i told her multiple times how horrible i felt, how i knew it was revenge and not her fault, how i still loved her beyond words and could look past this one day. But regardless she cannot directly admit its her without contradicting her self in the same sentence. Now im 1000000x worse off than i started, i want to take her back but i cant let her lie to my face esp vs a video that was clear af and 99.9999999% likely her. Look at me, saying 99 point W.e. shes admitted to it and im still defending her.... she has me thinking im crazy she has me thinking i lost my mind when everyone around me is like bro wtf is wrong with you its her shes gaslighting you.I just dont know what to do. There was alot of fighting and alot of her accussing me of cheating but over all she brought out the version of me pre severe depression and idk if shes going to make it worse or help it get better. Any advise on any of this would be really helpful","1"
"I've had a pretty rough two weeks because of my job to the point where I'm thinking of quitting even though I have nothing lined up after. However, my entire problem with my job began about 4-5 months ago where 6 people have willingly left a team (it was about 14 now about 8 left) and we haven't had replacements for the people who have left. This team I joined wasn't very good in the first place but I was so desperate to leave my old job that I didn't care. Now about a year and a half later, I'm really really stressed out by this one that I've been trying to get hired elsewhere with no luck. Nothing lined up and no interviews. I'm envious of the other 6 who were able to find something but I've had no luck finding anything. I live alone, I haven't spoken to my friends in a while, and I've been sleeping really late for months now. (Sleeping at 4 AM and getting to work around 10AM - 11AM which is allowed but not healthy.) I feel like I haven't had a lot of good things happen to me this year. For days I tried remembering what happened on my birthday (was 4 months ago) and I've been drawing a blank.

What i didn't mention was that through this year i was having some weird anxiety like issues with my breathing but it was only until July/august of this year that i started to gain control of it again and start being able to take that deep refreshing breath and not constantly feeling like my lungs are at max capacity. I've been doing tai chi for quite a while and i started using a lot of the exercises that i learned to open my chest up more and it's working wonders for me i go to school almost not worrying much and feeling happy (Alone but happy) and i go to tai chi class sometimes and i feel balanced and i feel a bit grounded in life.

"So my boyfriend's been on depression medication for about 6 years, and I'm not sure the dosage is right for him. What I mean is, I'm not sure it's strong enough. It seems to keep him from having serious suicidal thoughts, and from slipping into really deep episodes of depression. He can go a week or so and seem fine, but then he slips and gets really depressed and I just support him as best I can. But it gets so bad that even when I try to help, it feels like it has absolutely no effect. Recently due to certain events in his life he got severely depressed and I had to involve his family. Which has got me wondering....when people are taking the correct amount of anti-depression medication, how do they act? Are they able to behave like a neuro-typical person? Or do they just have ups and downs and their depression episodes are manageable for them?","1"

And since i see this place as one of the the best source to find help, i thought here i might find some.She is really sad, she tried to commit suicide a dozen of times, and she has cut herself too a few million more, that was never an option for me. But since i am very useless on that part, i am trying to look for help for her, we can't see doctors either, that's not something our parents would let us to do.I really want her to get better, and i promised myself that ill always try to find a way to help her do so. That's why i am writing this and asked that question.Triple thanks again for reading, quadriple if you care for her. Sorry if i wasted your time.","1"
"The truth is that we all experience and interpret the universe and reality in unique individual ways - only we can discover our truths and answers. Only a person can know what their heart says - what dreams it holds - only you know .now - I can tell this is not the first time you have denied yourself in order to please someone else - or to avoid hurting them. Its not wrong to be caring and sensitive to others needs but it is wrong to deny yourself things that make you happy.now look what has happened - you have lived your life in a way that navigates others happiness while sacrificing your own - going to this place or that, making choices . spending so time in other peoples happiness - its no wonder you dont remember how you can make your own. because somewhere along the lines of pretending and denying the heart - you forgot who you are. You forgot your dreams - goals. Life in its grind and in its harshness has steered you of course. the pain of it all - of not knowing who you are . day by day feeling more lost as you shuffle through reality in this confusing state . hollow will you become lest you break yourself from this state .its time to remember . to be by yourself and to seek answers withing your heart - to go back to even the painful memories and face them down and conquer them. to gain courage within yourself to find that happiness - to achieve those goals and lost dreams now remembered. some people may not understand - some people will have to rearrange their own lives - that confusion will make it seem like they are hurt -but their lives will go on -so shall yours.its time to remember - to face down everything. the sun that sets today becomes yesterday - a new sine rises today - as that sun rises so shall you - because it is a brand new day - a brand new chance to make new choices and to fight. if you fail fear not - because the sun will rise again - again and again . so shall you have these chances to make a step towards your dreams .I believe in you .

"Hi, im 27 and have been dealing with anxiety and depression for 15 years or so.  I have been hospitalized a handful of times.  Tried 8 or so different anti-depressants and anti-anxiety meds.  I've changed my diet, exercised, only worked jobs that were rewarding.... I've tried almost everything and I still deal with my depression.  I have good days and bad days, as I'm sure you can all relate to.  I recently found out about TMS (transcrainial magnetic stimulation) My father's coworker had it done and had great success.  After some research, I I found a local therapy office in my area (Central MA) that offered  the service.So basically, I am getting my brain zapped by an electro magnet 5 days a week for 7 weeks or so.  There doesn't seem to be many side effects but at this point, I am willing to take some risks to hopefully improve my overall mood and daily function.  I had my first session today and will try my best to keep updating you all with how things are going.  It's going to be a weird experience but I really hope I see some results.Here is a site that breaks down the therapy: http://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/transcranial-magnetic-stimulation/home/ovc-20163795We all come from different backgrounds and have different experiences with our mental health.  I just try to remember that even at my worst, I have persevered.  You may be down but you are not out.  Hold on and keep trying.  You are more than your diagnosis and there is more to life than fighting with your mental health.  ","1"

"I feel like there's no reason for me being here. Like I have no purpose what's so ever. And all I do is constantly fail. I'm 21 and I know that's still young but it feels like nothing is going to change. Everyone keeps telling me it'll get better but it's only gotten worse. I've had to move back in with my parents who love me but couldn't care less about my depression. They say either it's all in my head or I'm faking it for attention. I had to leave my old University because I screwed up really bad and can no longer afford to go. I now attend a community college in a field of study I have no interest in. I don't think school is right for me but neither is trade work. I had to do a lot of that type of work with my dad all the way up into college and I can't stand it. I have a part time job that won't really turn into anything and I'm starting to dislike that more and more. I don't know why. Nothing interests me anymore. Even if I wanted to fix everything I can't. I have no insurance so I can't afford a therapist. I can't even see my doctor. I live out in the middle of nowhere so there aren't any free services or community centers near me. My parents are overbearing and would find any way possible for me to not be able to go to that stuff anyway. Nothing is offered through my school. I have no one to talk to.  All I do is go to school, go to work, and sit in my room. I don't have any friends since I moved back home. I think I'd be better off dead but I can't kill myself because bit would be devastating to my family. I just don't know what to do. I've tried online support forums and stuff like that. I feel like I've exhausted all.my options and I'm just stuck. I have no options. Not even suicide.","1"
"> I've just witnessed somebody kill himself. I cried. For him and his family, for the future he could've had before he decided to end it all. I cried because I felt his pain and sorrow through his death. I cried for you, afraid you'd be doing the same thing. I cried because I know there's so much ahead of you that you need to see and believe and hope for, if only you were willing.> But reading your words right now? I think you already gave up. > It's one thing to know, it's another to do something about what you know.> You always say u got something in your brain that's wrong, you are aware of it yet you refuse to do anything about it. Makes me think you like being like that. So sure, I'd support you. Wallow, cry, have sex, feel empty, repeat. It's a vicious cycle but if it makes you happy and makes life bearable for you, be my guest.I sent that message to my depressed friend, who I care about, especially since nobody else knows how depressed he is and his family doesn't have any inkling about it. He replied with : i don't deserve u (he has always thought I like him cuz he's my closest guy friend)And I went: You're right, you don't deserve me, not like that. Otherwise I would've dated you. You're a bestfriend at best. I require more for a potential life partner. I care for you as a friend/family, especially since none of your family member know about your situation. But please don't confuse my concern as something else. Best of luck to you.I'm perplexed and sad at how he has tainted my concern with malice. What's with my friend? :(","1"

"I quit a year and a half ago, with support of friends and loved ones. I've been getting treatment for my depression and anxiety since than, alongside Paxtine, a relativly weak antidepressant.I'm definatly in a much better place than i was then, but it gets harder and harder to fend off the urge to cut myself. It's kind of like an addiction for me. What's making this worse is i'm inlove with a coworker. I can't tell him since we work in a room alone for 9 hours a day 5 days a week usually. I can't risk him not feeling the same. There's good days and bad days, but generally this is getting me down hard... i can't tell anyone that i'm getting worse, i can't deal with that again.I guess sharing just helps, thanks.","1"
"Hey Reddit, I've [23M] been feeling depressed for at least a year now and I was able to handle it until about 2 weeks ago when my girlfriend [20F] of a year and a half broken up with me. She claimed that she loved me but that I was suffocating her due to my anxiety and she couldn't do long distance along with school. The funny thing is that she has anxiety too so I thought she would understand mine but she ended up just throwing me away. She claimed she is asexual but I found out that she has been on tinder and has been going to party's wearing super slutty outfits... Needless to say I am not handling it well. We got into a couple arguments and she has now blocked me on all social media and told me she thinks I'm a monster. Ever since the break up I feel like I have been getting close and closer to just killing myself. I can barely eat and I wake up every morning at 5:30 without fail no matter what time I fell asleep the previous night. Every morning when I wake up I honestly feel like I want to die. It's like I wake up in a hole and have to spend most of the day climbing out of it. I started counseling about a week ago and have been put on Prozac but I don't know how I am going to survive until it starts kicking in. When I wake up in the morning my first thoughts are about my ex and it really fucks me up. I know that part of what I am feeling is the grieving process because I honestly believed here when she said we were soulmates and I don't know how to take the way she is acting. She broke up with me the day after accepting a promise ring from me... When I think about her flirting with other guys it really makes me wish I was dead. My friends say she is a POS but I still can't let her go. It hurts so much knowing that I've lost her. When we were together she would have a lot on her mind but when I offered to help she would get angry at me and say she doesn't need help unless she asks for it... When we broke up she tried to tell me that she still loved me but to see her turn around and immediately get in tinder and flirt with guys makes me think everything we ever promised each other was a lie. She claims she is looking for compliments and not hookups but I don't believe her based on how she is acting... No matter how often I think about this I still can't help but miss her. I know there are a ton of people who have been through worse than what I am going through and it makes me feel weak for letting thus effect me so much. She was my first serious relationship and now that it's over I wish I had never met her... I am honestly afraid that I will wake up one day and decide to just end it all because I don't feel like I can keep going on like this... My friends have been talking to me and helping me get out of my head a bit but I honestly feel like I am close to my breaking point. I know that if I died it would destroy my friends and family but every day I care less and less... I feel like a shitty person... I try to distract myself but I just end up thinking about her anyway. I don't find joy in anything anymore plus I can't concentrate on getting my life together because I feel so lost. Sorry I know this is super long but please if anyone knows of how I can get out of of this hole your advice would be greatly appreciated. My parents don't understand how fucked up I feel. I know it eventually gets better but I honestly don't know how I am going to hold on for that long. Please any help / advice would be greatly appreciated because I feel like I'm at the end of my rope...","1"
"Just looking for a place to let it out.  First time was when I was a teenager. Back then I had no idea what depression really was. I just felt low. I was the kid that always called to hang out. No one called me. So I stopped calling. I would lay in bed wondering if anyone would notice. I loved my parents and family to much. I would never want to put them through me taking the easy way. So I found new out cast friends. And ""got over it"". I would have bad thoughts every other month or so but my family was always my rock. I met a wonderful girl (now wife) senior year of high school and the depression seemed to get further and further apart. I'd have small episodes through the years. But she became my rock and a late night of video games would ease me back. Fast forward to 7 years ago. I joined the Army. Work was slow and I had a family to support. A little older then the other Privates but I worked with an Army Vet for a boss so I was used to working with Sargents. First duty station was South Korea. Didn't take my wife and two kids. Thus is when the depression started all over. I thought I had friends. I was alone. So many people around and the only one I could count on was across the world. Lots of nights just crying into my pillow. Just gotta get home and I'll be ok. I can't leave my family behind. Year later I'm home with my family. We move to Texas and I think I'm over it. Deploy to Kuwait. Thankfully I found someone who I can talk with. He seams as in need of a friend as me. We get through it. After we get back I hear he tried to overdose. I thought we were close but he never talked to me after. Two years ago I get stationed in Germany. Bring my family. See the world! I get through the two-three week excersises starting to be left out. Everyone has their click and I'm just that third wheel. Fast forward to a month ago. I'm in Lithuania for a LONG mission. I'm the asshole boss making people do training. No one wants me around. I get left behind at the store. I feel more alone than ever. I try so hard to facilitate everyone's needs but at the end of the day the Only one who cares about me isn't here. Only thing keeping me going is my wife and two kids. Caught a break and get to come home early. But back to back to back missions are going to be tough. I've never thought of needing help. I know where I can go. I just wanted to get this out. I don't talk about my past much and I hope if you read this all the way you know what I'm going through. Thank you","1"
"Well I have never posted before, but screw it. I don't know if anyone wants to know this crap, but I  suppose getting it all out might help.I have been dealing with random depressive episodes for years now but It was only last winter that I realized I needed help when my moods got out of control (sleeping all day or up all night, eating my weight in chicken strips and Dr. Pepper) Since,  I've lost 20 lbs, I've been medicated and see a therapist 2-3 times a month. I like my therapist, but there are some late night rants I don't want him to hear. The majority of the time I'm ""fine"" (or in other words: ""functional"" but usually with an undertone of barely masked irritation) but there are these unpredictable swings that come and I find myself wide awake on work night crying into my cat's fur (she thinks I'm insane at this point). There's a pattern to days like this: I have a so-so day at work, but slowly become more and more tense, until some small thing happens that makes me snap  (burning my dinner, forgetting something, losing my keys etc) so I freak out and lose my temper, but then I feel bad for it so my thoughts turn to ""I'm unlovable, worthless and mean and stupid and I'll never be happy I might as well end it all"" type of thinking. After that it's a blur of sobbing and Googling ""how not to kill myself""... I have a great sense of humor I don't want to die, of course. I just don't want to /feel/. I want to avoid, be numb, to abstain from life. I don't really have any current life stressors, save for work and even that's pretty easy. I don't really need much - I'm well fed, have money to buy the things I need and want. So wtf? Why? What if I die alone? What if I have to live my whole life in this yo-yo sad/ok/sad/ok state? Fuck. What's the point? ","1"

I was in her way and honestly for some reason I just feel like I need to be abused because I deserve it for being in the way. I already basically do it to myself but I don't think that's enough. And no I can't get help because no one in my life can ever know I feel like this. Mainly because my parents think I'm so amazing and they did such a great job and basically make fun of people like me not knowing I'm like that... It hurts not being able to come out and say stop.. But I don't matter enough to do so. Like my issues aren't enough to even warrant these feelings of emptiness and loonelyness because there are other people who got it way worse and I'm a selfish piece of trash.

"Long story short i have been in the most toxic relationship for over three years consistently and about two years on and off so in total five years of bullshit. Ive tried to move on at times i felt pretty amazing and finally numb to his shit, even thought i fell out of love. But no it always creeps back in that i cant seem to move on and still love him and everytime he comes back into my life he treats me more like garbabe and then says i cause him drama when i actually react and become emotional about it. I have basically declined into a depression and i some have suicidal thoughts which is mad, the latest breakdown i have had was this evening following a telephone conversation with him where he basicaly managed to make me feel like garbage yet again through some pretty advanced manipulation. I know i am sabotaging myself but I dont really know how to move past things anymore i feel like im getting weaker and things are starting to be pretty hopeless. This year so far my friend passed, other close friends betrayed me and ive pretty much come across constant hurdles, plus my anxiety is at an all time high, i know i am rambling, i feel isolated i dont know what to do really.

"this site is the epicenter of the internet, Despite that, it isnt traveled to by all, but those who do travel to it, and stick to it with a open mind are met with the awwing realization that helps them acknowledge ""I dont actually know that much at all."" this applies to me also, being just some tubby mexican loser who doesnt know what he want's in life at all, more specifically, he  can't choose what he wants to be politically, sexually or even career wise.

"tl;dr: I keep getting acute, reoccurring episodes of depression that last days or weeks and sap all my energy and motivation, and I am sick of it, yet I am unconvinced that ""talk therapy"" or CBT will stop these from happening.---Hi. I keep falling into acute depressive episodes for no good reason. I am goal oriented and want to be productive, yet I have this pervasive low energy and brain fog that translates into fatigue, poor concentration, low motivation, low interest in other people, and general dissatisfaction with life.Yet, I genuinely want to work and achieve things. I don't want to be inactive, or to retreat. I absolutely understand these episodes are not rational or worthwhile at all, but I can't seem to stop them coming.I have had panic attacks (a few weeks ago for the first time), for which I actually went to hospital. This resulted in lots of health anxiety. I seem to be past that now, but I am still getting depressive episodes -- sometimes that last only a couple of days, which then go away for a day, and then come back heavily the next. (Depression I have experience with that goes back since maybe 14 years old.)I have had blood tests done. I have another scheduled which will include my sex hormones. I do not have thyroid issues, diabetes, any underlying infections, and I have low inflammation (per my low CRP levels). Iron levels are fine, full blood count checks out, etc., etc.My question is, can this really be fixed with just therapy? My doctor brought up CBT, but I don't understand how CBT could possibly stop these nonsense low-energy, high-brain-fog episodes from recurring? They seem to spring from nowhere, not from conscious thoughts.I'm just running out of ideas. My diet could be better (more vegetables), but I have tried different diets and supplements and nothing seems to work sustainably. I will continue to try to improve this, and also maintain my exercise routine which helps, but what I really want is to stop these demoralizing waves of malaise from reoccurring.I'm just not convinced something so seemingly physical can be corrected by talking to a therapist.Please do share your thoughts and suggestions.P.S. I am male; 23 years old; otherwise physically healthy.","1"

"I would like to remain annoymous as this is quite heavy ... I need to know that there is going to be a light at the end of this tunnel. This has gone on for so long and I'm at my wits end. 5 years ago this year my mum died when I was 16 years old. She was a 45 year old fit and healthy, chatty and caring Mum. She started to feel really ill and went to the doctors after numerous misdiagnosis she was told she had bowel cancer. 20  days later she died. She was 45. I miss her terribly and things have never been the same. My dad, 11 year old sister and I somehow managed to solider on and moved house fir a fresh start. Things were still really tough but I was slowly getting into a normal routine again. My dad then started dating our next door neighbour. Things seemed ok but I wasn't overly happy that he had moved on so fast but I was still happy he wasn't alone. I then started to hear some really bad things from our other neighbours about her but my mum always told me to not judge a book by its cover so I just ignored it. Fast forward a few months and it all came out. She had a severe drinking problem and turned into a phyco after drinking. She was so horrible to me in several occasions, threatening to lock me up in a mental hospital. I watched as she ducked my dad further and further in. He eventually moved in and left me to fend for myself she would occasionally come round and be nasty. I had enough when they went on holiday and got engaged only being together for a few weeks at this point. I left the same night, my dad wouldn't defend me and he was letting this dangerous woman into our family or what was left of it. I was homeless and couch surfed at different friends  houses until I could stay with my grandparents. The only thing that I was worried about was that my sister still had to live there.  I eventually got in my feet, got into a long term relationship, moved in together, got a pet together but my dad and his wife were always lurking around the corner waiting to knock me down everytime something good happened to me. This went on in a vicious circle for 2.5 years. This really affected me as a person and made me doubt if I was a good person. I gave my dad one last chance last year at Christmas and everything seemed to be OK. Then I received a phonecall to come and pick up my sister as the wife didn't want her to live there anymore. My boyfriend and I went round and it was a complete trap, I was emotionally attacked and then physically attacked and threatened. After that night I made a decision to cut my contact for my own mental well being. I still met up with my sister as regularly as I could but the wife made it very hard for me to see my own sister and eventually not see my dad aswell.We had no contact for about a year and a half until May of this year I recieved a phonecall last one evening from my sister asking of her and dad can come and stay. I of course said yes and they stayed for around 2 weeks. I knew something wasn't right but I couldn't stop him from going back and my sister still wasn't 16 so he chose where she went. This didn't last long and they fled late one night to a hotel. It came out shortly after that the wife was drinking almost every night and becoming very aggressive and dangerous towards my dad and sister. Fast forward 4 months my sister has been stating with my boyfriend and I and my dad with his friends. I have been holding down my 9-5 Job, looking after my sister and trying to find them somewhere to live. Yesterday they got the keys to the flat but he has nothing, all of.the furniture he bought over the years has gone, all the furniture my mum left my sister and I has gone because his wife was jealous of someone who wasn't even living and.made him get rid of everything. My dad just acts like nothing has happened and I can't do that. He still blames me for alot but I don't think he realises the pain he caused me and how many milestones of mine he has missed, my 18th, my 21st, Christmases, mums anniversaries. I know I have my partner but he works crazy shifts so I feel that I have spent alot.of the last 4 years dealing with this completely alone. I'm glad that my dad has left but I am struggling to know how to act around him and how to help. His wife doesn't leave him alone and hates me. I just hope that once he gets away from her legally she will finally leave us alone. Thanks to her I have very little left of my mums things and hardly any photos. She has caused my family and I so much grief and I really hope she will leave us alone now. We are now at the stage that of we don't answer the phone to her she comes looking for us and we have to close all.the curtains and hide. I'm struggling to watch this happen to my.family and fot her to suffer no consequences. I know no one can make this all go away but please I hope someone has gone through something similar and is able.to tell me it will get better. Thanks for taking the time to read this. ","1"

"I was doing really well on a combination of Wellbutrin and Effexor. It's really the best I've felt in a long time. I think that glimpse into how things should be is making what I'm dealing with now that much harder. The Effexor gave me a fine tremor. I tried to deal with it as best I could, and in most situations it wasn't a bother. But it did start to impact one very important aspect of my job. I finally made the decision to switch to Prozac, but it's just not doing it for me. I'm anxious, I approach every decision with uncertainty, a lack of confidence. I constantly feel as though I'm being judged, that no one likes me, that I'm not good at my job. I'm not as productive, the paperwork is piling up. I didn't feel like cooking tonight, so I decided to pick something up, but the line was too long so I decided against it. It was a fight convincing myself to go take a shower. And now, well now I should be in bed. I'm sleepy everyday, so I shouldn't be staying up late. But going to bed means getting up, means brushing my teeth, washing my face, etc, and I just can't find the energy to do it. I'm not quite sure what I need, really not even sure what I'm after here.","1"
"We met, fell in love and were engaged four years ago.She changed, pushed me away all the time, until I was forced to call it off. I couldn't take it living without her in my life, I fell into an abyss of no job and bengie eating and not getting out of bed while she joined a gym got herself a handsome boy and they got engaged.by the time I was able to collect myself, I studied and got an awesome job offer overseas (Berlin), went there and slowly started my life while thinking of her less everyday.to be honest I was never completely over her, I could've never get with another woman because her face always appeared in front of me, her smell never left, the nights when I can't sleep because I think about her are the same for all these years.last March she broke up with the handsome boy, started talking to me again, it was a mistake and now she knows who she loves truly, made me fall in love with her again, said that shell come over and be with me forever, and I waited, and waited.eventually she asked me to return so we can be together there instead of where I am, I said no I cannot do that to myself, she turned 180 degrees again, broke my heart one more time and stopped even replying to my texts or calls.Now any half sane person who knows us and our story tells me that she's a bad person and extremely manipulative and I should never be with her, and i get that but my heart doesn't.Now I fell into that level of depression again, specially when I try to get high or drunk to forget that pain, it triples instead of going away, I became a mess and I'm so afraid of losing my job here as well.The problem is that no body cares about my problems, they all like the funny guy that's me most of the time telling them how and making them laugh to stop them from pittying me, but no one knows me well enough to help me when I'm a mess.I am also so afraid because last night I was high and alone  crying my ass off as usual, and I caught myself searching for painless ways to commit suicide, the pain was too much in my head  that I was seriously considering killing myself.I can't get her but her face doesn't leave my head, I can't be with any one else because I always think of her and plus I'm not exactly the handsome person who any girl would like, I'm over weight and usually calm and quiet after u get my funny all joking side over with, and I have no real friends who I can cry to without judging me.she's killing me slowly and I'm not sure what to do anymore.","1"
"Wow it's really early in the morning for me to be posting this but I think it's time I let it out. I'm depressed. It's been a struggle since I was 15... feelings of worthlessness and helplessness and nothing I'm not familiar with. I'm 19 now, in medical school, and I am so, so tired of my life. The new semester starts soon and I can't bear to go back there. I love medicine but I don't think it's the right time for me to pursue it. I'm always putting myself down, dreading days and I'm so tempted to go back to self harm. I come from a very close minded society who would not understand where I'm coming from. So what do I do?","1"
"life feels so empty and nothing seems to fix it. im a year and a half out of highschool, working a 2-10 job, and if this is all the future holds, I'm not sure if I can deal with it. I'm too anxious to ""burst out of my shell"" which I feel is holding me back. how do you overcome over thinking, anxiety, low self-esteem? I feel like I want to not care about anyone's thoughts of me but I am my worst enemy. I don't want to be/do nothing, but I feel like I can't help myself. I have always been told it would get better, but I feel like it's gotten worse, damn this sucks. ","1"

"Here I am in my final year of college, I have a good part time job and live in a studio apartment with my boyfriend. This semester has so far been my worst grade wise (worse than the two semesters I was working full time) my apartment is always dirty because I'm never home and when I am I am exuaghasted and can't physically do anything. My boyfriend often mentions the state of the apartment (he does help clean but works a full time job working 12 hour shifts in a factory and is also exuasghsted when he get home.) I feel useless, I know I can and should be doing better. I feel like no matter what I do im useless, if I spend time cleaning the house I fall behind on homework, and if I spend time doing homework the house falls apart and I never have time for just me.. I hate it. I'm falling deeper in to depression and I'm scared. ","1"
"Hello there,Getting down to the point; these past few weeks have been terrible and I don't know where else to really go to. Don't want to seem like a burden to everyone around me. I was wondering if anyone would be willing  to buddy up to talk? <3","1"
"Ok I really don't know where to go with this so I just write it here. In my entire life I've never had anything, I strived for, I enjoyed or I wanted to do. I just did things cause I was suppose too. Go to school get my grades. Then music opened up my eyes. That saved me from my depression a whole year. I felt great, amazing and fantastic I really enjoyed life. Then my music school happened. I got put down laughed at and neglected. My depression came back. I had it for the entire 3 years at my gymnasium not enjoying anything at all.I always used gaming to leave reality cause to be blunt I really didn't like reality at all. I then found out at my last year of the gymnasium that I have dyslexia. GREAT MORE PROBLEMS TO SOLVE!!! :)I went to a university for one year to find a way to handle my dyslexia cause I will always have it. The only positive thing I can see with all this is that I am really strong mentaly. Cause I never commited suicide nor did I think of it. So I guess that is why I get a lot of bad things in life , cause I can handle it.Anyways during this year. I meet a really cool dude that helped me a lot. I almost made it out of depression again. I then after this took  3months of preperation lessons for work hirement.I than went on one interview and got that job. I am having the same job today. I worked at this job at that time for 2 years. Then I went to Japan. During those 2 years I was really far down. I went to the hospital 2 times cause of over working. I am really good at what I am doing. I don't enjoy it tho... The only thing that kept me fighting through it was the fact that I was going to Japan. I went to Japan and was there for one year. Studying and working. The first 9months there was great! I loved it so much! I got new and awesome friends. Which I really want to meet again. They are such awesome friends! Anyways then my last 3 months was shit. I made a bad decision to pay a friend a all to big amount of cash. So I had to live poorly for my last 3 months. I was ready for it though and I can handle it. But I shouldn't borrowed the cash.Anyways I made it barely back home. I then were 2 months at home from living at my own apartment in Japan for 1 year. I was in my family's home again. Didn't like it that much. However after 2 months I got a new work at a eldery care. I worked there for 4 months.Then after that I returned back to the work I had before and I am still working there today. I got a boss position and I earn a lot from it. I am going to start studying psychology and french next month too. Plus I live in my own apartment. But here is the catch. The thing that saved me from commiting suicide when I got home from Japan was a girl I meet online when I was in Japan. We fell in deep love with each other for 6months we were together. But yeah I will express in detail a big thing about me that cause all this things to be twisted to something bad in my opinion after this.We ended it after 6months not on bad terms but I couldn't let go we were suppose to stay friends after. Well I went to far got obnoxious and was texting to much and was simply not over the break up. She blocked me on every social media. But after 3 months of none texting from either of us. She called me. I who is to much in love with her answered. We got back together. But I don't know as what. We are still texting and having good normal conversations. Nothing bad have happened this far. Been going on for another 4months now till today so to say. Now the side story, who am I;Well firstly I don't enjoy being social at all. second I am thinking a lot! Like really much. To much so to say. I am very focused on details.I also can't feel other peoples feelings. Mainly I don't even feel my own. This girl somehow made me feel her very well and I became a emotional wreck with her at times. I never cared for anyone either. I never had a motivation or goal cause I didn't have interest in anything.I love music and science but I jump between so many times all the time. I never settle for one thing. I am going for psychology cause I believe this to be the only thing I can actually find real enjoyment in.And yes I love traveling I have traveled a lot. I don't like to stay at one place.I never asked anyone for any favors either. I always took care of myself. I even started working at the age of 12 cause I felt like a burden to my mom. Cause we are a family of 5 kids plus the fact that my biological dad left us when the last one turned 1. So yeah she was to busy taking care of the other 4 kids. I was the oldest one so to say. So analyze myself I would say I have trauma about people leaving me. My dad, my older stepsister and my girlfriend. Then I would also say that I am not that attached to my feelings so I can't fully control them cause of early experiences that might shut my feelings off. I've had a hard time finding what I really want to do in life. Cause I never have found any enjoyment in anything. But since I think and analyze a lot I most likely would love doing that which a psychologist is doing. But who knows I might be wrong. But I really hope I'm not. Cause the study is 5 years I am going for a phd. So what I want to say is that I am empty inside like really dead. I really need a point of view that can make me understand what is going on. I am clearly not depressed constantly. Since sometimes I really am geniune happy so I don't really know what to take of this. I have even considered the fact that I might a have mental disorder or something. Cause everyone I met even my family have uttered sometime that I am ""crazy/wierd "" or something similair to that. So what is wrong with me?","1"
"Hello to anyone who reads this,I'm confused about how I've felt for the past year or so and any advice whilst I understand would not be from a professional point of view it would be incredibly helpful to myself. For the past years or so I haven't fell much at all, I don't feel anything wether that be happy, excited etc. I struggle to get out of bed on my days out of work and although I am aware I do have friends or at least people I should call friends I don't feel any sort of connection to them.However I do seem to have random outburst of euphoria and a sense of being unstoppable which seem to last a week at most, I find myself pacing around unable to cease talking and rambling about foreign ideas which is completely unlike my usual self. I have contemplated the fact that I might depressed as it has been seemed to have garnered media attention recently, and the symptoms appear to describe mine yet I feel pathetic to even consider myself as such which is saddening.I guess I'm just looking for anyone who is willing to offer their own experience in comparison to mine it's possible that I may be completely wrong and hypochondriac in a sense, but I've used a throwaway account as I'm worried to be labeled as a attention seeker.Thank you deeply to anyone who has taken the time to read this, I wish you the best.","1"
"My mental health has been rocky since junior year of high school. I have always been self-conscious and have been subject to self-harm and suicidal thoughts. As the years go on and I struggle through everyday life, my depression and anxiety are worse, and my image of myself has been completely shattered. Now as a senior in college with personal and academic responsibilities being piled on to me, my mental health has never been lower. Not only is it my personal and academic obligations that are troubling and me, but also the reality that the real world is soon approaching. And to add the cherry on top of this melted sundae, my relationship with a very close friend is about to implode and I am afraid I will lose them forever. I always thought I had control over my mental illness but the beginning of this semester has definitely proved me wrong. My heart has never felt so heavy. I feel like I cant breathe and my whole body feels numb. I know Im not alone in the physical sense, but at the same time my head, heart, and soul feel that no matter what, I will always be alone.","1"
"Hi everyone. I don't really know if this is the right place to post about this but I will try anyway.I am 19 years old and when I turned 18 last spring I was soooo ready to get my driving license. (In sweden where I am you may aquire a driving license at the avge of 18.) I had dreamt about having a driving license for about my entire life, not because I Love cars and engines, but because I would Love the sence of freedom that a driving license may give you. And yeah. The story goes as the title reads. I fail. Everytime,Ive tried 5 Times and failed and I have taken notes of what I did wrong to try to make it vetter the next time, but it doesn't matter because I get sooooo nervous before every test so I manage to screw up even the simplest things. I am really sad because of this and every day that passes without a succesful driving test is making me an even more complete failure. When I tried to take the test the first time nose of the people of my age had a license. Now almost all my friends have one and those Who don't have one has not tried. I have had serveral depressions because of this and I keep believing that the only way for me to get rid of the problem would be to succeed on that famn test, which I don't feel I can do if I am sad all the time and super nervous and without hope. I have been thinking about this every day since I failed the first time which is more than a year ago now and it doesn't really lighten me up. I have even been considering suicide because I don't feel I have any worth because nobody takes fucking 6 Times to take a driving license. I feel so Damn ashamed about this every day.I have not tried to talk to a psychologist about this but I Will eventually. The breaking point came today when I went to my new job for the first time and the way there went past the driving Office and I started crying on the bus and had to take breaks every hour to go to the bathroom and cry even more.I can't take this anymore. I know I have to do something.","1"
"Forgive me for any mistakes but this is the first time I've dealt with this. I've never dealt with depression myself so I'm not sure where to start. My dad is normally a happy cheerful guy. He's the guy that will call you at random to tell you a dumb joke he thinks is just hilarious. He's always been there for me no matter what and has always been the rock for the family. Last winter my mom lost her job and was hospitalized with a health scare. She's ok but was going to need surgery. A couple months later, she found another job making significantly less money. She had her surgery in May and had to miss 6 weeks of work. The loss of income forced my parents to make a drastic decision and sell the house they lived in and put a lot of work into. They downsized to a much smaller place that Dad picked out but he was really unhappy through the entire process. He instantly had regrets and felt like he made the wrong choice. He hates the house, it needs a lot of work he didn't realize it needed. He feels overwhelmed and is so mad he was forced to move in the first place. He hates his job. He is 56 years old and works a blue collar job. It's very physical and is out in the Texas heat all day. He works long hours and there is really no end in site. He has health issues. He's already had 2 major heart attacks over the last 15 or so years and was hospitalized earlier this year for pneumonia. He has no interest in anything at all. He's always been an introvert and not very social but lately all he wants to do is watch tv and sleep. Every weekend he wakes up, eats, watches tv and sleeps. It's drives my mom crazy. He gets very angry for no good reason. The smallest thing will trigger him and he will be mad at the world for days. Mom said they had a long discussion yesterday about how much he hates his job, then he cancelled a family cookout and today he wouldn't speak to me. We always talk twice a day, without fail. It's killing me to see the man I admire so much go through this. He's always been a ""tough"" guy who doesn't admit when he's sad or hurting and I know this is taking it's toll on him. Does anyone have any advice on how I can help him??","1"

I think we both realize this is the end of the relationship but neither of us want to let go. So I sit in my misery and drink my weekends away while pretending not seeing her doesn't bother me. Meanwhile she is just doing everything she possibly can to not think about me. We are both dealing with this terribly and I can't focus on anything else.

"  For almost two years now, maybe more, I've been struggling with low moods, nervousness and irritability. I don't want to say depression or anxiety because I haven't been officially diagnosed. That's really my main problem. I need help and I don't know how to get it.     A few months ago I reached out to my school's councelor who helped me talk to my mom about how I was feeling. It's hard talking to my mom about stuff like this because I don't think she really understands. She's the type to think if she can get through it wthout help so can eveyone else. I told her what had been going on with me and she seemed to understand. We talked about geting me help and even went to check on a councelor outside of the school. She said she would take me to see her over the summer and it never happened. The closest she's gotten to mentioning the my breakdown last year was when I told her I was nervous about school and she said ""I can't deal with that again"". I can see why she would say that. I have a history of becoming extremely stressed out to the point of breaking, but it makes thing diffcult for me when I have no outet to work out what's wrong. I'm too scared to bring up this topic with her again.    I don't want my mom to think I'm lying about the way I feel because I can usually manage throughout the day. I'm fine around people. I can talk and be normal, but theres always those thoughts in the back of my mind. I've been in really dark places. One of my friends is the only one who really knows. Along with that I find my self being easily irritated and I have really bad stomach pains when I start to feel nervous.   tl;dr: I told my mom I was having problems, she said she would get me help over the summer, it never happened.

"So I'm currently 19 and used to have a decent friend group, not too big and not too small, it kinda just felt right. That was during my final 2 years of high school. Right before graduation a big fallout happened between mostly everyone and after that I kind of turned into a recluse. I put off going to University straight away and only really spend time with my girlfriend of now 2 years. At first I thought that was fine because I really do love her, but I miss having others in my life. For a while I thought that I could depend on just her but I'm realising more and more that that isn't fair on either of us. She's tried introducing me to a few of her friends but I completely suck at socialising. That in turn always rids me of the little amount of motivation I had to begin with. I have really bad social anxiety so I find it difficult to meet new people anyway so the fact that I don't know how to interact with them as well makes it even worse. This situation is slowly deteriorating my mental health and overall stability in life but I don't know what the solution could be.Anyways thanks for reading!

"I tried, for years, to make my previous relationship one that would stand the test of time. But, alas, my other half was not wanting to be happy with me. We argued, we fought, we stopped talking, and eventually I moved out because it was a one way street. It seemed like the love had gone from her, I love her and still do, but we still talked because we are mature enough to try to put things behind us. While I was away she jumped right into the arms of someone we absolutely hated when we were together and now she's trying her damdest to make it work.to make it worse, their relationship was kept hidden from me due the fact that I still loved her and still helped her at times, everybody knew except me. Now my dog is dead, my twin is dead, my family is dead and every time I see them my head gets twisted round the fact that I wasn't worthy of a relationship with her.I really don't know why I'm posting this, I just had to write something down.

"I have nothing against mental illness but I find it offensive, for all the sufferers and their relatives, the level some people do to 'glorify' their mental illness and use it as an excuse not to try harder.Some even think it's cool and 'artistic' to have mental illness because of all the famous people who suffered from mental illness.Guess what? They used their mental illness to fight through and left a lasting legacy in the world.So stop glorifying your mental illness. Live above it. Take your meds. See a therapist. And stop being a victim. Be a victor! Trust me I know what I'm talking about. ","1"

"Hi, I'm 17 and in senior year of high school. Two years ago I was diagnosed with an anxiety disorder even though I've suffered from it years before. Since I started high school I've had depressive episodes, but this year I've never felt so bad in my entire life. I've been feeling like trash for months, especially the last two ones. I went to therapy and she said she's worried about my thoughts since I've thought about killing myself several times - I've tried to choke myself but then I remembered a friend and gave up because I didn't want her to get hurt.I'm struggling because my therapist also said that I have a social problem because I want to connect with people but I can't since I don't have the tools, which are taught by the parents. That's what she said and I understand, because my dad never talks to me about anything, just small talk and studies. I can talk to my mom, but when I was a child I was taught by her that I should be the best person I can be, that I have to be certain way, etc. which maybe I took too seriously. but I can talk to her. They're not bad people, they always gave me what I needed. idk why I'm complaining so much, even though they're so mean sometimes, but everyone has their bad days.I've always been a shy, introverted person since I'm a child. I can't really connect deeply with people. I always think everyone's a good person which has disappointed me so much. I have struggles at getting close with someone because I'm always thinking they're just using me because I'm dumb. I don't know what to do.","1"

"Hi, this is my first time here. I've been struggling with depression ever since I can remember, but at this moment in my life it's the worst it's ever been. Some major life events led me down this path but now the depression is here to stay. I can't get free. It's this awful voice in my head telling me terrible things. Yes, I'm on meds but they only quiet the thoughts. I still have them. I don't know who I am or who I'm supposed to be. I lost all trust in other people. I try to find reasons to stay, things that make me happy but I've lost all interest. I used to love art but now I can't even start a sketch before I'm bored. I can't even watch a movie and I'm bored. I feel empty: nothing inside. I don't know what I'm supposed to do. ","1"

"I tend to get depressed and lonely during winter and fall, it's been this way for a couple years. It's hard not self-destructing my relationship, I see things through these funky goggles (depression) and it taints the way I see things. My boyfriend goes to school 1.5hours away from me and doesn't text much or anything and I was fine with this all before and during the rest of the year, but come fall I get anxious and upset about it and feel rejected and such. It's hard to hold things back and not say things that are stemming from depression rather than me. Any advice? ","1"
"I have depression and anxiety. I just went to the doctor and added on a other depression med because I have fallen further into depression. My dad has stage 4 non-small lung cancer and is slow dieing right before my eyes. I feel alone in this... My boyfriend tries to help the best he can... But I feel like no one knows what I'm going thru... Sorry about the rambling. I guess what I really need advice on is if I should continue working or take a leave. To spend as much time with my dad while he is still alive... Part of me wants to take a leave. The other part is telling me that I should separate myself from him. So that when he dies it will be like his already been dead... but then the first part is like spend time with him while you still can... damn I'm rambeling again... Thoughts?","1"

"I have anxiety and depression I've had it for quite a while and I don't have any friends other then my boyfriend I try to make friends or tried to but I ended up hating hanging out with them the whole time and just wanting to be in my room alone . I can not hang out with people one on one that's the worse I would rather be in a big group I wouldn't hang with any of my friends if we were 1:1 because it made me so nervous and I don't know how to deal with things . I don't do anything really but my work sit at home go to school and hang out with my boyfriend and lay in bed or occasionally do things, I get upset when we can't hang out because he's the only person I'm ever with ... he understand I have depression and anxiety and I'm always gloomy or sad and I want to kill my self sometimes or I just feel like there's no point being here .. no point in the world really he's the only reason I'm here . I've had a bad past with guys being used (forced sex also ) and it still haunts me .. my boyfriend is the only person I can be most of my self with but he also doesn't understand me at all nobody does .. I really don't have anyone to talk to I go to therapy but it doesn't help my life is just so damn boring and all I feel like I ever do is cry . And on to what's happening I just get so sad when ever I leave his house or he leaves mine I don't have the best relationship  with my parents them being hard core Christian's and me an existential nihilist I just can't wait to get out of the house in a year. I'm good at faking it so my life is ok with my parents  now but like it sucks the constant judgement and show I have to put on for my family everyone in it because if they knew I didn't believe In god they would send me alway... when I wake up in the morning they always ask me did u read the Bible pray exc and I just sit in church on my phone every Sunday the biggest waste of my time I drive separate so I can go to my boyfriends house after but they make me stay to talk to them ( I go to high school church ) my parents go to the adult ) to make sure I don't skip or something , they believe I'm ""Christian"" thi from the act I put on .

I'm a deeply caring person and I see good in everyone but it's just a lonely feeling because nobody can help me . Even tho I don't have friends I'm always the person people go to I conceal most of my feelings but when people notice nobody is there for me .. if you read this whole thing I'm sorry I'm such a mess and sorry if it's so confusing but can u help me please my god damn therapist can't even help me .","1"
"So when I was 16 years old I was diagnosed with depression, I was cutting and had suicidal thoughts. I have always felt off, like something just isn't right even as a child. I've never been able to describe how I feel and right now it's even difficult. I feel a lot but at the same time it feels like I feel nothing? I can't seem to make up my mind and I'm either low and feel very irritated or really high and want to change every bad thing about myself ( eating, excerising, and hobbies). I am always worried about dying and avoid suitations because I'm anxious. I am not satisfied with anything. I've tried different religions and beliefs. I've tried everything. I become really interested and completely change myself and then lose the feeling of satisfaction. Now I'm 23 and my wife is BPD. I feel like I'm losing grip with what's going on. I've had a lot recently happen to me. Did you depression turn into bipolar? I don't talk to my wife because she says I'm always changing my mind. ","1"
"Hello.I'm a 33 yo man and I've been diagnosed with severe depression last december, and with bipolar disorder and post traumatic syndrome in february.I've been through some tough shits, but, the trauma comes mostly from being raped when I was 9. I had cut myself from the memory. I mean, I never forgot what happened, but i kept acting like it didn't, and nobody ever could suspect a thing. It happened during a school trip and I know than the man who raped me molested another child the day after.Despite knowing I'm the victim in this, I can't put away the thought that I could have prevented other children from suffering the same thing i did. I know of one other victim, but how many more have there been after that ? I've been unable to speak about it to anyone until I was in my mid twenties. I seeked medical help about it for the first time this year. I told my parents a few month ago, and after building up my courage for several weeks after that, i finally went to the police.Telling the police was an awful experience. I wasn't prepared for it. The guy lacked empathy and pushed and to grab info I wasn't prepared to tell aloud.But what's really killing me now is the insomnia. I'm under huge medication, but still have very bad sleep. I dread falling asleep because i'm having very vivid nightmare almost every single night. I often wake up screaming. I'm very thankful to have a wonderful and very comprehensive wife. Most of my nightmares are of children trying to punish me for not protecting them or being forced to watch them being molested. The worst nightmare I had was one were I was a child and I was chased by a rapist who had the face of the adult me.I usually can't sleep before dawn, when the exhaustion takes over.During the time I'm trying to fall asleep I peel my skin off with my nails. I got scars all over my hands and arms, a few on my chest, but more importantly a huge one in plain midle of my forehead. I don't know why I can't help it, I don't feel itchy at all, but I feel this need to tear myself apart.I've felt a urge to crash my car many times while driving, but kept myself from doing so by thinking about my wife. She's the only reason I'm still there enduring this. The sleep deprivation is becoming unbearable. Most days I don't get out of bed until my wife comes back from work.I stopped seing my psychologist 2 month ago after she canceled an appointement. She left a message on my phone to place a new one, but I never called back.I feel weird, like I've completely lost any will to fight the depression anymore. Most of the time I don't feel suicidal, and when I do, thinking of my wife chases the thought away pretty quickly. But I don't feel like doing anything anymore.","1"

"This has not been a good year. I graduated college last winter and have struggled to find a job since. My fiance kicked me out of my home and moved another woman in. I'll omit details about the abuse. I moved back in with my sister after not having anywhere else to go. I started therapy as well. Fortunately, I was able to keep my management job. After so long of being underpaid and disrespected constantly by the staff and customers (youngest person working there) [23F], I decided to quit and seek something related to my degree field. At the time I was dating someone who too became abusive (mentally, emotionally, financially, sexually) and let his daughter treat me anyway. Fast forward and I'm unemployed going on month 4. I have placed 100s of applications, seeked help from staffing agencies, asked for references, etc. I feel like an absolute failure. I'm not sure what more I can I do. The guy I'm dating now [36M] has offered me pt work so I can gain experience -- which I'm beyond grateful for--but I'm afraid because I don't want to disappoint him. He's the best thing to happen to me in years and actually is investing in a future with me. Any advice on managing depression, gaining motivation, coping with unemployment, etc is greatly needed and desired. ","1"
"I am 20[F] and I broke up with my first ever bf 2 months back, we go to the same school still. I tried nc and it didnt help. Ever morning I wake up with dreams of him and it takes me 2-3 hours to get normal and start working. I am in school and it's so lonely. I feel like I am not good enough for anything, I have little or no self left. It's really hard for me to even go have my meals as a consequence of that I have lost a great deal of weight. I tried joining the basketball team here, as I used to play in high school to get my mind off and get my life really going. But it didn't help either I go everyday tire myself out as much as I can. But even then I have trouble falling asleep and doesn't make me hungry either. I have really suicidal day dreams but thinking about my parents stops me somehow. I have so much academic work to do(I was a dedicated and a sincere student) which just makes the condition worse. I am just letting so many people down. Being an introvert I don't have any meaningful friends either. ","1"
"I am 20, I can't tell much about my personal life however, all I would say is that I have this particular issue that my family and some people mock me for. They don't understand it. It has been causing me a lot of depression for long. I am now also in a relationship but my family wouldn't approve of it.. It may get to the point that they would literally create lots of arguments for me.. My sibling also had certain issue and moved far away to Europe to get away from my family because they were causing her hell! She tried explaining them but they wouldn't listen and would just laugh at her to the point she decided to sort of.. screw them and make her own choices... Since I am young, I don't have to take any step for my relationship just yet but later on I may need to and just the thought about that stresses me. My family thinks they are doing right in their own way and are trying to protect us.. While I was away to Canada for university, I got disconnected from them to the point that I was willing to stand up for myself for what I believe in and also, I sort of started hating them for dividing the family so much. However, whenever I go back home to France, my family show me so much love that I end up feeling guilty for everything I feel, think, believe etc. For summer vacation, I stayed with my family for 3 months back home and I got so connected that I feel soo depressed. They seriously do a lot for me... Its just that they think what they are doing is right and no amount of argument or discussion is going to change their mind.. Believe me, I tried. I was pretty much a ... family oriented person back when I was in high school.. My siblings were my bestfriends as I was bullied a lot in high school. I have also been sexually assaulted. I loved hanging with my family more than anyone else. Now its so hard. My depression has increased to the point that I ended up getting bad grades, have headaches all the time, lost interest in my partner, feel tired all the time, just thinking about future makes me cry and the only way I feel a little relaxed is when I think "" Ah perhaps I will die soon"".. Also, I am having lots of problems with my university.. Professers are shit, degree is risky cos people who graduated from here, some of them claimed that many faced problems cos of their degree... as the university isn't accredited by the Canadian law.. Rather the country the university is originally from... I talked to my family about it but they don't think anything would happen and just keep telling me "" Don't listen to others "" .. I am so fed up of explaining them literally anything that I am just done. I don't wanna do it now. I am so stressed about literally everything.. Career, family, future etc. I don't know what the hell to do.. I just wanna kill myself. The only thing holding me back from committing suicide is the thought of hell existing and me not knowing whether God is pleased with me or not.","1"

"I've come a long way in my fight with myself. Some days are tough, others are a breeze. Three years ago I was self destructing- I was trying to find the end. I have an incredible support base in my friends and family. They carry me when I can't carry myself. The last three days have been particularly difficult. My relationship is in trouble. I've lost confidence in my S/O because of a mistake they made. This can't be the thing that sinks me, right? It's feeling especially shitty- I'm down on myself, I've been driving for hours, I don't know whether to scream my lungs out or cry myself to sleep. I hate that this is happening and I just want to turn back the clock. I've overcome so much. Why is THIS the thing that's eating away at me? I know I can live without them. I didn't want to have to choose. The worst part is that they feel horrible about it. It was very likely, truly an honest mistake- a momentary lapse in judgement. They're so torn up over it- hurt that they hurt me and ruined something they want. What the fk do I do? ","1"

"Ever since I've graduated high school my depression and anxiety has spiked high. I'm going into a community college now and I've been researching online how to deal with my anxiety attacks that spring, sometimes out of nowhere.My boyfriend of 3 years, whom I've talked to everyday is busy in university, and I close myself off to everyone else. I feel alone, and I get scared of the sudden thoughts of harming myself and committing suicide. I've been diagnosed with clinical depression since 10th grade.This usually happens when I'm alone in my room in the night, I start shaking and I feel a deep pressure on my chest. Then I start crying until I keep gagging (I used to cry so much I puked as a child) and it all feels out of my control.It's been affecting my relationship, self esteem, and happiness. I don't want to burden my family with medication while they are paying for my college tuition, and I feel like a hinderance when I think of discussing it with any of my family members or my boyfriend.Does anyone have any suggestions of how I can control my anxiety attacks?","1"
"Where to start. So I'm 24 and my life's in a complete rut in every way. I graduated from college in 2015 with great grades but can't seem to find a job no matter the skill level or experience required. Basic jobs claim I'm overqualified and the jobs I want claim I'm underqualified even if its an entry level position. I studied a pointless major I never should have picked but I thought it would get me a job I liked whereas my brothers seemed miserable in their lines of work. But hey at least I have a mound of crippling student loan debt! I keep seeing other people I know who are able to easily succeed or get what they set out for which just makes me wonder if I'm broken or cursed or something. While I was in college I did find out that I have a knack for photography and videography which I've tried to pursue but to no avail. Been completely broke and living at home in an extremely dysfunctional household since college. Not even gonna talk about the ""relationships"" aspect of my life, I generally do nothing and barely talk to anyone on a daily basis even tho I was relatively social before this. I've kinda always had an empty feeling inside (horrible childhood caused by constantly being picked on both at school and at home. Escalated to really really bad stuff I'd rather not get into right now) but in high school learned how to mask and ignore it so that other people wouldn't think I was weird/a downer (not that that's healthy). Pretty impossible to do now with nothing to occupy my mind which has just led me to believing that I'm a screwup who's completely useless and deserves to be where I am. I never forget mistakes I've made no matter how hard I try. Tried suicide once before I even got to high school (never told anyone about that) and never thought I'd be in that state of mind again but I'm there. I have no idea what to do. Lost any desire or drive that I once had. Never posted on reddit or done anything like this before so its new to me, honestly whatever you got. Go for it","1"
"Prestory:I am 20 years old and about one year ago, I was more happy than ever before. I met a girl which i immediatly fell in love with. I only had to bear one more year of school and could finally begin my preparations for my dream job. I felt like i could handle anything.But one day, about half a year later, i started to doubt everything. At that point i realized that i have to leave everything and everyone behind to pursue my dream. And the day came close when i had to move away from home, from all my friends and from my love. So i decided to abort all connections to them to ""already get in touch"" with being alone.After a month i couldn't bear it anymore. I became depressed and had to get in contact, at least with my love, again.To my luck she was very cool with it, even though i hurt her with just leaving. And i had a great last month with her.And then it really began to go downwards. I moved out of my parents house, alone in a small flat. In an area in which i dont know anything or anyone. And far away for anybody to ever visit me.I stayed in contact with one friend and my love, but soon the lonelyness began to really screw me. At that point i thought i would never be with my love again, and i was okay with it. Or at least i thought so.But then she told me she has a boyfriend. It was always a back and forth with my hope fore ever getting together with her until that point. Sometimes because she gave me the hope and sometimes because i misinterpreted her.I just couldn't hold it back anymore.The last part is already three months in the past and i still haven't recovered. I try to kill the pain with alcohol as often as i can. But i dont drink when i have to go to work the next day. I think because i still want to fulfill my dream. And i spend most time of the day thinking of how to kill myself. I know that i am still a few steps away from actually doing it, because i still have hope it could get better. But i just can't find a way how to get out of my black hole. And everytime i think it gets better, something really small happens and brings me back down.Tl;Dr: I moved out if my parents house, lost all my friends, my big love is unreachable for me and i spend all my time in my tiny flat eighter doing nothing in my bed or drinking until i fall over.I always have the feeling that my problem is too small that it should get me depressed, but i just can't handle it. And i never thought (and still dont think) anyone can help me with it. But i have to get it off my chest.Sorry for bothering you all. I will write again if i got out of it and if i don't, i won't be here anymore.","1"

"Hey, everyone. Yesterday was another disappointing day. I smoked some MJ to get it off my mind, reduce the stress. I was having a pretty good time, I was laughing so hard. Then I started tearing up just because whatever I was laughing at was so funny. It went from 0 to 100 real quick. I started actually crying. I felt pain, the disappointment, the hurt, and the confusion. I have never felt so much emotion rush out like that. These past two weeks, I have been just holding everything in because if I didn't everything would be worse on the outside. I need to keep everything contained and to myself. I am tired of trying to share my thoughts and emotions when they are always being told it's stupid or unreasonable. Am I really being a drama queen? Are my feelings true then? I don't know myself anymore. ","1"
"This may sound crazy but i'm now convinced. A couple of weeks ago i have to mention i was hospitalised for a severe mental breakdown. Since then, i have moved back in with my parents, with my boyfriend, and i'm surrounded by a happy environment. But ever since i arrived, I've been having a lot of dreams/nightmares that are very personal to me. They normally entail things that happen with my parents, my brother or my boyfriend.For example, i had a dream last night about my boyfriend being unfaithful and my previous abusive ex boyfriend coming back into my life, and by the end of it i trusted my ex boyfriend much more than my boyfriend. And i wanted him out of my life. When i wake up i feel like i haven't slept at all and i woke up in a very depressed state. i couldn't even look at or touch my boyfriend for hours because i'd convinced myself that he wasn't what i wanted. After a few hours my mind adjusts and i see clearly again. But as soon as i sleep, this trance of distrust starts again and the trances are getting more intense and last longer every day. I'm scared that i'm going to wake up one day and no longer trust anyone i know and love and i'll hate everything i now love to do. i feel like my own mind is trying to take everything from me and i can't do anything to stop it. I'm on the waiting list for therapy and i'm terrified that all this will happen before i can even get help.","1"
"I've been on meds for a few years, treating depression, and at first they worked, as time rolled on and the meds were updated, we found they were doing way more than shrinking the distance between being so depressed I couldn't function and being a functional zombie.  My situation is pretty lightweight as compared to most.  I ended up quitting the meds for a few months and things were way better than normal.  Then all the symptoms showed back up, typical stuff. So I went back to the doc, got back on the meds and back to functional zombie mode. I discussed this with the doc changed the meds, got really sick, from the new ones, went off them, waiting for tests and some new meds from doc.  In the mean time, I'm having more trouble than normal just coping. Dread about getting up to go to work, work is an ok job, but now I just cant imagine doing this for years on end. I find myself in this weird place ""hamster wheeling"", get up do chores, got to work, come home do chores, eat, watch tv, sleep, repeat. The norms. But for the first time in a long time I am where I don't have that one friend I can vent with to try to keep from letting all the anxiety build up, I don't want to unload on my partner, shes having a tuff time at the moment too. But in the lasts few months I have been on the edge of this very creative group of people, I marvel at their ability to create art, and I'm very inspired by the lives they live. My financial status keeps me from, chucking everything and ""run off to join the circus"" but Im trying to find a way to get more of their ""energy"" into my own life. I'm struggling with a lot of ""who am I"" and ""what have I done with my life"". ""would anyone notice I was missing"" ""what makes me happy"" questions.  I'm not a young person anymore, about it hit the 50 mark in a few more years.  I don't have some crazy exceptional career, just one job to the next, to pay the bills.  I never had that ""do what you love, love what you do"" job.  I just worked, its what you do.  I'm having a very hard time feeling ""happy"" or even just feeling good, about anything.  Its so difficult just keeping up the appearances now.  I feel that old sinking feeling about wanting to just sleep all the time, or just do mindless tasks. I don't want to go back to that dark place of existence. I've tried talking to shrinks before, but the platitude of ""what do you think"" makes me crazy when they do that, or just placating with ""have you read this self help book""  I guess I'm just venting to the either.  Any suggestions are appreciated.","1"
"I haven't cried since...  I can't remember.  Early teens?  Anyway, lately I have felt like breaking down into tears.  A wife material woman, lost opportunity, happiness gone etc. I am a grown man in the oilfield who was always taught men are tough, surly beings who choke it down and handle there business.  The company I keep would surely find it unacceptable.  I'm here to tell Reddit screw that I'm going to cry.  I'm thinking this Thursday. If it makes me feel better I'll let you know.  It's got to feel better than the broken feeling of trying to hold it in every day.                   Sincerely,                          Hurt Roughneck                           ","1"
"I really dont know what to do anymore. One min im happy the next minute im in complete sorrow. It feels like i have this hole in my stomach and no matter what i try to fill it with it just gets bigger and bigger. I dont want to die.. But would just like my brain to have some rest...just some time off but obviously i cant. Im at my wits end with trying to feel normal i have tried every type of antidepressant on the market. Cbt you name it ive probably done it. I just feel like my brain is totally fucked and broken and there is nothing i can do to fix it. I hate feeling like this..being nasty and aggressive to loved ones and making people cry and frightening people is all i do and bring stress to peoples lives is all i am good at. I just want to feel happy is it really to much ask.","1"
"Hi reddit I've never posted before, and don't know if I even belong posting in this sub, but here I am.I've never been tested for depression, but this feels like it to me. I've not been happy for years now, to the point where I can't even remember genuinely being content with myself, or my life. I've tried lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, cutting back on addictive consumables) and none of that makes me feel better. At first I thought it was my dad passing 4 years ago that triggered my downward spiral, I thought it was my decision to push  loved ones away that caused my sadness,. I'm 23, in college and have not been able to socialize with others because of my hangups, I've lost nearly all long term friendships because of this. In short, I've felt as if I have isolated myself, and can't seem to rebuild any relationship, be they friend.or romantic. I feel like I've failed and ruined what I had, and even if I can't get them back, I want to at least move forward because I've gotten myself into such a deep hole and I don't know how to get  out.  This probably reads poorly but if anyone wants to give advice, I'm willing to give anything a try.Thanks you in advance ","1"

"Trigger warning: Talk of suicide and methodThe last few days my boyfriend has been very suicidal and depressed, and has been talking about going out onto a hiking trail and hanging himself. Today he actually went out onto a hiking trail, and naturally that made me very nervous and worried for his wellbeing. So I texted his mother, alerted her to the current situation and did my best to help his family locate him. Thankfully while I couldn't get his specific location, I kept him on the phone until someone from his family could locate him. Now he is pissed at me and no longer wants to speak with me.It's something I've noticed with depressed and or suicidal people. Whenever you get them any kind of help, they almost instantly get angry with you when you succeed in getting them help. Can anyone please explain to me why that is? I know I did absolutely nothing wrong, and if the tables were turned, I'm sure he'd do the same for me. So, why do suicidal people get so upset when someone succeeds in getting them help?","1"

"So, hi. I'm new to this subreddit but I just need support. I am a college student at a midwestern university & ive never felt more alone. I'm a junior and I used to have a great life here. I had a lot of friends and always did well academically. This year has been different. I'm completely alone on campus. I live in a single room and I never have anyone to hang out with. I'm involved in organizations and I talk to people in classes yet I can't seem to make connections. All of my former friends left me alone for no reason which I don't really understand. I've started to develop an eating disorder and I just don't have the motivation to do anything but lay in bed and cry. I've been trying so damn hard to get better but I'm so stuck and I have no signs of getting better. Our university has awful mental health services so that is really no help for me. How is it possible to be surrounded by thousands of people yet feel so alone? To have people everywhere yet really have no one? I just don't know what to do to get out of my funk and feel better again ","1"
"I am an incredibly depressed 20 year old boy. I was very recently diagnosed with High Functioning Aspergers (HFA) and since then I have had no idea on how to think about it. All my life I have thought differently from everyone around me, and I hate the way I think. I had such a decent childhood, good parents and good friends, so I don't know where these years of depression came from.  I'm 20 years old now and even while on prescribed FLUoxidine (prozac) I still feel hopelessly dead on the inside. Everyone who has tried to motivate me I've registered as antagonization so I can't learn from other people. I am taking prerequisites at the local community college. I am behind on reading because of my hobby of playing PC games and my lack of passion for reading in general. I remember that it is my obligation to get the work done and it destroys my pride before I can motivate myself into doing the work. I am a socially active person on the outside, but on the inside I am soft, and constantly need comfort. I am unemployed. I only had my first job at Carl's Jr. for 3 months because I couldn't handle my manager telling me that a mistake that I made was unacceptable; I cried myself to sleep that night. I don't drive yet. Two years ago I was traumatized by my first failure to yield under my learners permit. The fine was $200 but the amount of psychological scarring I endured from being confronted by an angered officer was a debt I feel like I will never repay. I live with my parents. They tell me that I still have to be dependant because of the difficult job market. I've never been in a relationship. Every girl I have had a crush on either has a boyfriend now or I've never seen again.My passion has always been in using my voice for something like commentary work or voice acting, and my hobby in playing PC games like Dota 2 have always been my passion to enjoy. I constantly think of what people think about me, as well as my hobbies and interests. I never ask for their honesty because of how I might be hurt by their rebuttal. I have always been weak in this sense.I can't function in society because of my mental unwellness. Even as write this, I am lying here on a friends bed during their father's birthday party. I want to give up desperately, but with everyone pushing me I feel so pressured to not succeed for myself, but for everyone around me. Every day of my life I wish I could just disconnect from society forever, and be happy with isolating myself. I came here to talk about my problems with people that have haf a similar experience. If you have any questions about me regarding my depression, I will answer as soon as I can. I just want to know that I am not alone in this painful existence that has submerged itself into my mind and emotions.","1"

"I can no longer live this life of depression. I want to be normal. But, I don't know how. I see those people smiling; enjoying their lives and laughing to their heart's content. And I am jealous of them. They CAN laugh, they have friends, and the biggest of all...THEY ARE HAPPY. I wish I could be them. I have been suffering from depression from the past 3 years. Since then, every coming day has been harder for me than the day before. Back then, I had a few friends (people whom I could trust). But now, I walk my path alone. Now, I have no friends. No one with whom I could talk to and share my feelings. Hell, now I don't even trust people. And I don't feel I have any goals/objectives on this planet. My life is a complete mess. I want to love and be loved. But, I can't even talk to people, let alone love. Seeing those couples holding hand in hand, laughing all the way, makes me wish the same...But, I am not granted the pleasure. I am very weak at making friendship, attending social gatherings. Some people think that I don't give a damn about their work...But I do. It is just that I can't be at places where I don't know people. No matter how strong I show myself to be from the outside, I am weak and broken within. I never fell in love, never had crushes, until now, and the fact that she can never be mine, and I can never talk to her, pushes me deeper into the pit. I was once good at academics (before all this began). But now, this depression has made me bad at it too. I liked to play video games, but now I don't. All my energy is drained. I don't want to live any more. I just want to press the ""Reset"" button, and start it all over. I want to be better, want to make friends, want to laugh like them, want to love, want to be loved, want to talk to someone who can understand me, and most of all, I WANT TO BE HAPPY. I WANT TO BE NORMAL.","1"
"I've lost the person who meant the world to me. My best friend in life and person I thought was my lover. I feel lost every day from when I wake up until I go to sleep. It's hard to replace not only a gf but your best friend also. She was a great person overall with the exception of two time I caught her texting other guys. I never really told her how much that hurt me each time but when she finally left me that hurt was the worst. I don't have other friends because over time people moved on with there lives and I needed up making her my entire world without realizing it. She was my only true friend in life. Now I have no one to talk to about anything let alone my hard times in life. How could someone after 13yrs just decide one day to give up and not want anything to do with me. I'm starting to feel the effects of the constant isolation and emptiness I encounter on a daily basis. My life feels so incomplete now I don't feel like I can keep going on. Today is especial hard for some reason. I miss her so much to the point I just can't find any type of happiness thru out the day. Even the smallest things remind me of her and what we had together. I hope things get better but I'm just stuck with this hurt. I've talked to someone already and with little help to me so I'm at the point where I don't know what to do. I just can't shake there's feelings and let her go. I'm getting worse with time with everything so that old saying time heals everything it just isn't working. :(","1"

"I'm definitely going to start seeing my therapist again but I'm in such a pit of misery. It's been a few years since I was on Zoloft and I was only on it for about 6 months before I told myself I didn't need it anymore. I hardly drink anymore, maybe one or two whiskey drinks in a two /three week period because I don't want to add to my struggle. Recently I've been so overwhelmed at points and felt like there was a dam of tears ready to come out but then I found myself completely unable to shed a single tear. I only leave bed to shower and work. If I try to tell my parents, they'll say I'm being dramatic. My two closest friends I've driven away over the past year because I've been on a path to better myself (no drinking/saving money to move and go back to college). Is it possible to get out of this pit without the drugs? I'm so close to just giving up and getting back on Zoloft. What defines clinical depression? I go through the same thing every 2-3 years but this is worse. I feel myself emotionally disconnecting from my co-workers and family.","1"

"My anxiety/depression has spiked this past year. I've always considered myself to be high functioning, but I'm entering suicidal ideation territory and really scaring myself. I'm lucky in that I have a fanatic support system and have communicated with those trusted folks about what I'm going through, but I'm still falling apart. I need help beyond talk therapy.The problem is I freeze when I try to get an appointment on the calendar. The furthest I've gotten is reaching out to a psychiatrist's office, but actually scheduling that appointment feels impossible.Complicating matters, I work at an agency and I'm relatively high up the food chain with a demanding client portfolio. I rarely step away from my desk to grab coffee, never mind take an actual lunch break.So I can't play phone tag with these intake coordinators all day. Then when I finally do get lucky in talking with someone on the phone instead of trading voicemails, I explain my schedule and they tell me they can't accommodate me. It's become exhausting and I'm seriously considering committing myself to get the help I need rather than deal with this over and over and over again.In addition to a very full day, I'm usually working late into the evenings to stay on top of my deliverables. I've been vocalizing how my workload is affecting me for the past year, but I'm a senior lead so there not much they can do. There's also this unspoken rule against regular therapy appointments during core work hours. And very few mental health facilities have evening hours and there's NOTHING on weekends.I KNOW my job is a huge source of stress and anxiety, but I have no savings and some debts, so I'm terrified of putting my job at risk. I've also been job hunting, but frankly, my anxiety and depression are causing similar issues there, too.I've looked into online options, but my insurance plan won't cover it. I'm in between GPs (same scheduling issue), so I can't get a referral. I've asked friends for recommendations, but I just keep running into this same goddamn wall of not being able to get an appointment.I've even tried taking a personal day to give myself the time to call around, but I usually waste the day stressing about all those dead end phones so I wallow in indecision, then beat myself up for not getting it done. I've been job hunting because I recognize how unhealthy my current work environment is for me, but I'm struggling to find a lateral move.Has anyone experienced something similar to this? How did you push thru? Are there any services or options out there that I'm missing? I really don't want to commit myself, but short of a magical mental health scheduling service, I'm at a loss on what to do and I'm just so exhausted with the whole process.","1"
"In battle there are times where the intensity is high and times where the dust has settled and the soldier can gather his/her thoughts, and most importantly emotions, depression is the same way. I have been in a hectic state of anxiety and depression this last week and last night was the first night I felt true relief and I want to share how.  My girlfriend recommended I spend some time with my friends, not my aquatances but my close friends that I can talk to with anything at anytime. I didn't think that was a good idea because I didn't want to place my negative emotions and problems on them. But yesterday my car was giving me some problems and my friend came go help me fix it and we ended up chillin afterwards. I had the chance to talk to my friend about everything going on in my life and they did the same. It was truly therapeutic and relieving. My advice to anyone in a slump is to get around your close friends! The people who have your back. When you need the support most go to who has always given it to you, not because they have to but because they want to. That's the difference between family and friends. And I am sorry if you are in a situation where you don't have close friends. Stay true to yourself and they will come to you with magnetic force! ","1"
"I was doing my things when I remembered a painful memory. I lost someone I considered a true friend because she couldnt accept that I have depression. She was my maid of honour, so you can imagine how much of a dear friend she was.But that afternoon on my terrace in my hometown I didnt see a friend. I saw a stranger. But before I tell you more about this story, I need to tell you who she is as a person, and what I was when we were studying in the same class in high schoolI studied in a very prestigious school - the best in the country. But unlike other systems around the world, back home it didnt matter how much money you have as it is a public school and you enter by passing really hard exams. Competition was fierce. But I did it. And it took a lot. In fact, so much that I couldnt start the year in my new school because I got seriously ill. It was basically possible that I could die.Anyway, I went to school after 4 months pass the beginning of the school year and I managed to catch up and make friends. I was always an A student. I was among the smartest in the school and all teachers loved me. As you can imagine, my friend, lets call her Liz, only saw me at my best. Liz was another one of the smartest. I always admired her - super intelligent, ambitious, beautiful, resourceful, speaking 3 languages at the age of 16 (now they are 5). She is a very good hearted person, very genuine and compassionate. So compassionate that she started dating a guy who she felt sorry for because he was madly in love with her. And then he broke her heart. His confidence got so high that he was referring to himself as ""God"". And I'm not exaggerating! Crazy, I know...Years later we lost contact. Until today I keep in touch with my other girlfriends from school but Liz was different. She entered university and started working immediately. With all her talents and drive she got up the ladder pretty fast and didnt take long before she dropped out of uni. She disappeared. We rarely ever heard from her. But in my heart I always had love and aspiration for her. My other friends were pissed at her but I knew she is doing what she loves and wants, so who am I to judgeAt uni I was under incredible pressure - I worked two jobs, while studying Law at the best university in my country and at an international school at the same time. And I had my heart broken. Then I met my now husband and had to deal with distance of 10 000km between us for 2 years. But I fought hard. Eventually, of course, I collapsed. It was really bad. That was about 8 years ago and is when my depression destroyed me. I couldnt deal with life. Oh man. Just thinking about all of this makes me want to cry AND vomit!At the end of the day things got a bit better for me. I started therapy, pills and had huge support from my family (which by the way didnt come easily with my parents). Then we decided to marry and I asked her to be my maid of honor. We kept somewhat in touch during the years and this was a way for me to try to get close to her again.The wedding was amazing, she helped me so much, everything was great, we were close again. Until I told her about my depression. I will never forget her eyes. She was looking at me with so much frustration, disappointment and even disgust. She started shouting at me, while I was crying after pouring my soul out. And I didnt even tell her 50% of the pain that was inside me all these years. Liz kept repeating: You are not that weak, get yourself together, you cannot really be serious"". Then she got up and left my house. Without saying goodbye, without making an eye contact.That was not even the most heartbreaking part. I knew it was a lot to take for her. I know it is not an easily acceptable topic. It is hard to realize all the pain I have been through. Even more so, considering she knew me as that tough girl who never stops and always aims at the top. I knew she needed time. So I gave it to her. She didnt reach out to me for more than 6 months. Not a single word. And all of a sudden she texted me saying she wants to talk and fight it out if we have to. Fight it out? Does she seriously believe we can fight out this conversation? She expects what - for me to say sorry I am depressed? Sorry I let you down? Even despite that I decided to give it a try so I texted her when I got back to my hometown. She got back to me saying she was working and has no time. Unbelievable. I still haven't seen her. That was two years ago. It is clear to me - it is all about priorities and I am not a priority for her at the end of the day.Well Liz You are not a priority for me either. You are simply an example of one of the many people who don't want to hear about depression. You are one of those who think they are strong because they don't let themselves feel down. For you,  depressed are only the weak ones. But you are wrong, Liz. I am strong. Depressed doesnt mean weak. It means I have the courage to face my demons on a daily basis. To win my struggles and challenge my urge to perish every. single. day! Can you face your darkest thoughts? Can you face your monsters? Can you stop for a minute and ask yourself who you are and why you are? I can. I do. And that is why I am so much stronger than you will ever be.I'm a fucking lion!Peace out!Sofia Blue","1"
"So long story short, My brother has ADHD and goes on pills to calm down ect but every day when I or mom get home he calls us both whores bitch cunt ect.. And this is no joke he literally does this and usually asks to fight me and throws things at me so when mother threw him outside to play he kept pinging on the door and I shut it so he couldn't annoy us and my mother turned to me and said ""Stop fucking around do you have ADHD too and need fucking pills are well? Are you as retarded?"" This is not the first time I've been insulted for TRYING to maybe save myself from sadness. Most of my life my brother have been Favorited or gotten all the attention also gotten away with EVERYTHING because he has ADHD or because he is younger, He's one year younger than me. Why does that matter so much? It's not a big time skip between us so I don't understand why I'm the one every one takes out the blame on when I do nothing but try to stop it. This is affecting me mentally as I am starting to think that it is my fault and now people calling me retarded makes me.. Happy?..","1"
"TL;DR at bottom           Let me start this with a little bit about my past. Early in high school I went through, as much as I hate to admit it, an emo stage. I battled with depression regularly, attempted suicide and was on suicide watch and it was a very bad time for me. I started getting really into drugs thinking I could self medicate but slowly turned into a poly drug addict which essentially means I just took whatever would fuck me up. I battled with addiction heavily, bad breakups lead to more depression and more use and I started to slack in school because of it. Despite being so depressed all the time I did have friends who tried to help and I talked to regularly.            Now let's skip forward a few years to where I am now, still young I'm a freshman in college, I beat addiction and have been clean for 9 months now, I have an incredible girlfriend who I had a crush on from freshman year of high school, and I'm doing really well in school. So I should be happy right? Well I don't understand what's wrong. Most of the time I am fairly happy but I find myself dwelling and getting really upset about the smallest things so often I just can't explain to myself why. I think maybe it's because I don't have many friends now, I basically only talk to my girlfriend with the exception of a few buddies I play video games with who I went to high school with. Everything though has been going great, I got away from the partying and drug crowd I was with in high school, and my girlfriend treats me probably 10x better than I deserve. I'm sorry this turned into a venting session but I wanted to make it clear that I don't really have anything to be depressed about but for some reason I'm still finding myself upset often. I just want some ideas on what I can do to keep myself happy and from slipping into these bad moods. Any suggestions are helpful but I really would like to avoid any kind of prescribed/self medication. Thank you.TL;DR: I have a great life and nothing to be upset about but still find myself depressed regularly. Looking for ways to keep myself happy and from slipping into depressed moods. Thank you.","1"

My boyfriend (Of 1.5 years) a bbq d i have been having issues. I love him with all my heart. But he keeps pushing me away. My hours at work have been cut dramatically. I found out I was pregnant and then a week after, my body decidedly didn't want it. So now it's still in my body but not developing anymore.  He didn't want it. I feel like my mind is going crazy.  I cry almost every day. I have thoughts of suicide. I just feel like I'm in a big pool of stress, depression and shit. I feel scared. I'm scared I'm losing my love. I'm scared I don't wanna live.

"I have had many issues throughout my life had a decent childhood minus physical and mental abuse by a cousin prior to preschool maybe after.  Was molested by him to.(can count the people on 1 hand who know.)Repressed it till mid 20's when I started having nothing but vivid memories of it.  Only thing that actually can picture in my head.  Haven't been able to picture things since that time. Can think of things but can't see them.  Was a big pothead which allowed me to be happy for the 15 years I smoked but spent the night in jail and haven't smoked but a few times since. Ima big advocate in medicinal use. Since then have tried antidepressants with no good out of them. Really don't like pharmaceuticals drugs. Have a decent job and another 1 to make ends meet. Work 50 to 60 hrs a week. Shitty medical so stay away from docs as can't afford it. Have a place to live. Thanks to ex wife who was my support even when we both didn't know it. Got 4 kids. So moving back home is out of question. Which would get me back into a great job for me financially and physically. Don't have suicidal tendencies thanks to my kids. Which is the good thing. Love my kiddos. Just don't have anyone to talk to that can help me turn around. My good weeks at week at most long. Then right back into slump. I go to church which helps. But am limited with time due to working. Am definitely an introvert which limits me.  Get massive anxiety but am able to hide it still. The whole list of bad that come with depression. Never happy at work don't even talk but to a few here and there.  Hoping to find a way to turn things around. It's hard with my situation to find an out.  Any advice or something that may help me.  I'm the type that would rather text or chat. Don't know if there is even a place that has like a buddy system kinda thing for that. Also I now live in a rural area think the 3 big cities have like a 100k people here.  Also I work nights 12 hrs shift 1 job and days at the other so sleep is limited especially with my kids. ","1"
"I've had it.  tired of sitting around playing video games and smoking cigarettes to pass the time.  Tired of feeling this way and have been looking for ways to get out of my current rut.  I'm interested in seeing if others, if not another single person is willing to go on an adventure and fight their way out through physical exercise.  I'm looking into a three month jump to Thailand for exercising and getting out of this state I currently am in.  I will go alone though I know another person to assist in pushing each other would be better as the rewards would then be twofold. If anyone is interested, shoot me a message.","1"
"Depression has been something I've dealt with my entire life, even as a young boy I remember feeling this dark emptiness in the background of my awareness as I tried to play with the other kids who just seemed to effortlessly be in the moment and let go. I never felt like everyone else, and if you've suffered from this terrible mental disorder you understand what I'm talking about. I began to realize there was a name for what I was experiencing when I was a sophomore in high school. My mother has depression and she was the one who helped me understand what it was. I was glad to know that I could like her, take something (antidepressants) that would allow me to at least slightly lift this void that held me down for so long. I began taking Wellbutrin and it seemed to help immensely. I never had any serious relationships with girls as a kid and after taking these meds for a month I had a girlfriend. I also had an easier time focusing and learning in school and began self educating myself on things I was interested in. I guess you could say this was the east fix, but I quickly ruined that. I had a 16 year olds fairy tale view on the world and thought that drugs could solve all of my little quirks. I asked the doctor for adderall to focus and that was great until I realized I couldn't sleep, so I asked for sleeping pills. Now taking 3 different prescription drugs to function, along with high amounts of caffeine, I was a walking zombie. We all know that for every action there is an opposite and equal reaction. I was to pay for these choices and I did. I eventually had a panic attack in front of my junior year psychology class, how ironic that we were leaving about panic that week. It was terrifying, debilitating, and I wanted to die. I developed a phobia of public speaking and thought that the way to get over it would be to take online high school classes and isolate myself from my classmates and friends.Now off all the meds it took about 6 months before the depression crept back in and broke me down after months of not having enough social interaction and meaning in my life. Back in the wellbutrin it was. That helped a ton and got me to begin taking a college course where I knew eventually I would be forced to speak in front of the class. Eventually I did and gained some real confidence because if it. I had faced my biggest fear and without the meds it wasn't possible. I didn't want to admit that at the time but unfortunately now I understand that it's true. Stayed on the meds for a whole and eventually I went to  a meditation retreat that made me feel totally cleansed and ready to take on the world. When I got back I began working a door to door solar sales job where I was forced to get out of my comfort zone every day and speak in front of the other sales reps weekly. It changed me and I was so excited after I quit the solar job go take this newly found skill that I never though I would have into creating a great life for myself. And that's exactly what I did, started a podcast,  YouTube channel , landed a job that I fulfilling and allows me to work with great like-minded people.  My life was great and I was doing all sorts of things to help keep the depression away. Diet, yoga, martial arts, having a schedule (Jordan Peterson Prescribed) , affirmations, havujng a doing everything I need for a great life so that when I ween myself off these meds I'll be fine and will be freed from this depression. I finally got off them 8 months ago and at first I felt fine but little by little I noticed it was harder and harder to deal with the little and big tragedies of life. Until this last weekend I collapsed. I couldn't take it anymore and wanted to end it. So instead of killing myself I swallowed my pride and got back on these meds and am now starting to feel better again. I hope someone can resonate with this story. For some of us no matter how much you try to treat yourself naturally be it microdosing psychedelics, diet, healthy lifestyle,  exercise , etc you may still need that external crutch and accepting that is the only way (at least for me) that I'll be able to focus on other things of more importance with the help of my antideppreasants.  Not saying these are the answer for everyone but certainly for some it can be a life changer. ","1"
"Hello world, I'm going entirely off book buy posting this here but I'm getting desperate. I've spent my life wandering through a fog of self loathing and never asking for help. Everyday I slap on smile and go out into the world and show them everything is ok. It's not ok, it couldn't be farther from ok. I don't deal with my problems, when something comes up that starts prickling on my insecurities I shove that shit down into some deep dark pit inside my head where it'll be ignored indefinitely. Eventually every now and then I'll have a total break down on account of all my deeply repressed issues. But even then I soldier on. I walk out into the endless doldrums of life and still I slap on that smile, I've been really good at convincing people I'm fine so I won't have to talk about it. So I back my self into these corners, all the people closest to me never knowing how close I get to the edge day after day. I'm 24 years old and I've never been in a relationship, I've definitely never slept with anyone. This is a fact that offer perplexes my friends as I always put forth this friendly and thoughtful face. But I can't. Everytime I see a girl who I might approach I'm in my head saying, ""Don't you fucking dare asshole, she seems like a nice girl. She definitely doesn't need your fucked up pile of shit in her life."" It never ends, I'm my own worst nightmare and its impossible to run away from myself. I don't know what to do, I often find myself thinking there's nothing left to do. Contemplating the unthinkable... I could never do it of course, cause I couldn't do that to those who are close to me. And in the end I think that's my problem, I put others first. Always others first, because I believe myself to be not even worth the effort.","1"
"HiHelloGreetings.Honestly I'm not sure why im writing this, i think i have just reached a point where I need to talk about this outside of family, outside of therapy and outside of my doctors office. The issue I have goes above what I experienced and still experience with my depression, during the early years (around when I was 16/17, I am 25 now) I started to lose myself. Not in drink or drugs (although I did partake) but to hide the pain and the fear I felt everyday I pretended to be someone and something I wasn't. Each person or group of people I had different faces for. For some I was a nerd, for others I was a musician , super chilled and creative. To others I was a jock, loud , boisterous, confident and brash.But now.... I don't even know who I am. The person(s) I was never really existed. I talk about this because I hope to hear that I'm not alone , that others have faced this and found a way through. Thanks for your timeSam","1"

"Well to start off, I'm 17, almost 18 and I have given up on trying to help myself. I've officially stopped seeing my therapist and taking my meds because I just have no more fight in me I guess. Since I was 10 I've seen doctors and tried to figure out one problem only to develop another one-- when I was first diagnosed with anxiety the doctors realized it was caused by depression, when I was getting over my depression I started to feel terrified leaving the house causing me to drop out of school which was then diagnosed as agoraphobia, then just as I was coming to grips with going into public I started hating myself so much that I stopped eating to punish myself and that's how I developed anorexia. I am so fing tired of all this trying that has gotten me nowhere. The worst part for me is that I can't tell anyone how I really feel because it would get me out in a psych ward again- the truth is I'm disgusted by myself and wish I could just fall off the face of the earth. For so long I've tried being optimistic about adulthood but the reality about it makes me lose all hope and I just feel so defeated.","1"
"I am not a person with a specific dream, in fact I have no idea who I want to become. What career path do I want to take? What my best interests are, or how I even want to be remembered? As I think real hard about it, I seem to get more and more anxious. I feel so alone all the time when I am clearly not. I do not like temporary solutions to my problem. I am 18, have decided not to go to college because I am in fear of setting myself up for more failure. I am also at a loss with joining the workforce. I know I have to for a sustainable living but I have no motivation. No purpose or meaning to my life. On top of everything, I stopped trying. I want to try. My family knows I am not the same person after high school. I am less active, I don't go outside, and I am not playful. As I'm writing this I feel bored. This is my first reddit post in the middle of the night and I hope this is a good outlet to share a brief introduction to my saga of depression. I do not know how this works but I have read threads on this site that I can relate with and often times the feedback are true and helpful to a situation. At this point in my life I am literally just seeking an opportunity to be a part of something. To have meaning and not be a waste of space doing absolutely nothing each and every day.","1"

I've been jobless for a week now, and I'm panicking as hell, cause my rent is due and I have to pay the college fee, which was so stupid of me to even start studying again, being 26 today (what a happy birthday to me, eh?) I'm at the edge of becoming homeless and owing money to a foreign country, as I am in the UK. I'm deppressed, anxious and eating sedatives like candy.. I've never asked for anything from anyone my entire life, I always was the one that would give his last piece of bread to someone that needs it more. But at this moment I'm sitting in tears with an empty head, suicidal thoughts, and my last cup of tea. I would beg for money, but that's way too easy, and knowing my luck would be impossible, so I'm asking for a way to earn money, or work for anyone, before I do something stupid.. Again I'm truly sorry for this post, as I think it does not fall under this sub's criteria..","1"

"Hello I am an 18 year old female who has had depression for over three months. My depression was after my anxiety. I remember just having anxiety disorder then one day I woke up feeling completely hopeless and empty. I felt out of control. Everything felt pointless. Then I got depresonalization. So I feel even fucking worse and out of touch with reality. I just had to have all three but it's okay. So I've been able to cope for a little while now it susually been my dp acting up. But um I'm pmsing so all of a sudden all three have been at a high level. Lately I've been having bad luck and bad outcomes. I've been trying to get a job for a while but something unfortunate always happens. I had to switch phone companies because I couldn't afford my phone so now I'm currently using a phone I don't like. Which sounds spoiled and I wish I didnt care so much. I've been feeling out of touch and I just want to feel reality again. I want to appreciate the small things in life I'm tired if letting the little things making me want to end my life or making me feel like I'm useless. I don't want medications and I never will so please don't advise that. I haven't even tried the natural remedies such as exercising or going out more. Perhaps when I try them and nothing works then I'll turn to medication. I just feel constantly useless. I feel like I'm lost. Im stuck on wanting a relatiinship. I feel like everyone loses interest in m quickly and as if everyone is annoyed by me. I always think about how others don't have a place to sleep or are living in a shitty country yet I'm here depressed. I don't have an excuse but I can't help it. It's there and it won't go away. No matter how much I acknowledge how priviledge I am to live In a decently safe country. I wish I could help people. I want to help others like me but it triggers me when they mention their feelings. Ugh I just feel so useless and pointless and like I'm always dreaming. I've been crying at random times. I cried driving home today from my grandma's. I just felt like stopping somewhere and crying like a baby. But I decided not to. I've bee arguing with my mom lately and I just feel shitty agterwards. I can't just control from talking back. I hate that about myself. I want to be right all the time. I constantly feel like I can't breathe. Sorry for the random writing. I feel socially isolated. Even when I'm out the feeling lingers in the background. If I'm out for too long my do gets strong and I end feeling like fainting. I can't even sleep at night. I just don't feel tired or my thoughts are racing all the time. I can't even fucking get a job what's the point of my existence? I don't have insurance because I'm broke. I tried many therapist that left me broke and they end up telling me stuff I already know and tried. Plus they always stare at the clock while I'm talking so I feel uncomfortable and whiny. Why do humans experience this? Why am I so unsatisfed with life? I feel like life isn't enough. I feel like everyone experience is mediocre. I haven't even tried much out yet I feel like it's gonna suck and feel pointless. I get clingy to anyone who shows interest and I want to focus on myself only. Fo things for internal happiness. I was on track with doing that and it was going well then I went back to wanting to do things to impress others or for the extrernal life. I want my own happiness I don't want to believe that relationships it materialism is happiness. I want to be able to grow old and look back at my life and die happy because I lived my best possible life I could ever.  ","1"

"There are really no good options when you don't have any money. Sure, I could call a suicide hotline, but all they would do is send the police to my house, who would arrest me and take me to the hospital. So super, then I'd have the traumatizing experience of being put in handcuffs for being depressed and a hospital bill I can't afford that would eventually be sent to collections and wreck my credit. I'd still be physically alive but still no closer to fixing my mental health and all of the awful life circumstances causing my depression in the first place.I don't know what to do. I have no one and nothing. I had some things to look forward to about a year ago, but those fell apart, and now I have truly nothing. I know I'm not being specific, but I don't have the energy to type out a really long story, and it won't matter anyway. Truthfully the only argument I have against dying is that it would kill my dog if I was suddenly gone. Earlier today, she ran away, and while I was outside looking for her, the thought that kept running through my head is, ""What if she's dead. What if a car hit her or she went swimming in the creek and an alligator ate her? Then I'd truly have no reason left to be alive."" This is what my life has come to. Nonstop thoughts like this.I want to go to a therapist so bad, but I can't afford it. Don't tell me that there are therapists who will reduce their fees or that there are free clinics. A) It doesn't matter how much the therapist reduces their fee if I have ZERO MONEY, and B) Free clinics do not exist in my area. At all. I've researched extensively, and they just aren't a thing. I say this because every time I've posted about my situation online in the past, I've gotten flooded with people telling me to go find a free clinic or to start calling up therapists and asking if they'll reduce their fees. It's exhausting to try to explain over and over again that those solutions don't work.Okay, that's all. I had to say something somewhere, and Reddit is free at least.","1"

"Excuse me if this post is all over the place. I just have to get all of this out.I thought about killing myself today. This wasn't a fleeting thought, or just something that randomly crossed my mind. And all I could think about is how easy it would be for me to do. The relief it would bring to those around me.I got in my car and was on my way to the gym,  but once I got on the road, I forgot what I set out to do. I went back home and sat alone in my living room instead.I now have to force myself to do the things I used to love. All of my favorite things are just things now. I haven't thought seriously about hurting myself in years and today, I just feel like something broke inside of me. Like there's nothing left. No good, no positivity. Just a void and a shit ton of broken pieces that everyone around me is forced to pick up. I am a burden. I unknowingly externalize my illnesses and force them onto those that I love. They don't deserve that. They try to help but they can't. I've cried, I've screamed, I've reached out for support, but I believe the time has come where I just sound like a broken record that no one wants to hear.

"I'm 21 and I gave up on college a few years ago. Dropped out and stayed at home. I'd much rather be dead but seeing as how I clearly am too afraid of pain I'm here still even after constantly telling myself I'll kill myself eventually and living life to its lowest due to that. But I would need a quick way to do so, like a gun because most other methods are far too painful and scary. Guns are instant, don't have build up, but are illegal in Canada. I don't want to end up homeless not because of having nothing, because I don't necessarily desire anything, but because of avoiding embarrassment. For the past few years I've done absolutely nothing and had no communication with anyone apart from family in my household. None. I cut off contact with everyone years ago and just remained hidden. I don't want to reconnect.I've never even done anything on my own. I don't know where to go or how to start or what to do but I know I need to be free of my parents because they're the ones who have always kept me in away from others. I was never allowed freedom even when I was in college. I was forced to pick a program to go into back when I was graduating from HS. Obviously I picked whatever to appease them. Things got horrible when I quit but I've been numb to all the arguing ever since childhood so I'm used to hearing shit. They've never shown support even when I was in a crisis center years ago, they're close minded, live a very straightforward life, don't believe in depression and I know they're a cancer to me so I want to be rid of them and live my life for once. They've never let me experience anything and even kept me away from social settings with friends when I was younger. I was never one to rebel against them as a child so I did what they told me which was basically ""stay at home, focus on school and don't spend time with others"" and ended up experiencing no practical life skills. Never even had a job. They think people who go outside often are doomed to fail in life or something, they hate western culture and all the social shit, not realizing social interaction drives most people to want success and lack of it makes them hate life entirely. I don't know how to explain the feeling of having only your thoughts and imagination for nearly 3 years now. I've been bored for so long. I've only spoken maybe a sentence a day. I'm just numb at this point but this is the one day I'm feeling like I want to make things better but I don't know how.I woke up today in immense pain. I'm unhealthy at this point physically as well as mentally, underweight, my head and ears hurt from something and I listen to music so often to stay numb that my hearing is slightly damaged.I've seen the comments here and I'm not even expecting much but since I'm still here and took the time to make a throwaway on this old dying phone of mine that could stop working any day now, I'm obviously hoping for something to come by. But when this feeling subsides and my ear stops hurting I'll probably just end up going back to bed, with my music to fuel my depressing old thoughts.","1"

"My wife and I were together 5 years and married for 7months when. She had an affair. Along with the affair I caught her with a different man in our house. We split up and I got my own place. I keep our two kids most days...she gets em every now and again. My first night in my apt alone I bought a pistol and ammo and put the mother fucker in my mouth...i cried and cried and wanted to do it so bad but all I could think about was my son not having a dad around that loved his so much. I gave my pistol away...She and I have been discussing trying again. She says she cut all contact with dude and my stupid ass believed her. The kids have noticed us getting along and I can see that they're think we'll get back together. I cried when my son told me he missed his old life. I still cry. Recently she told me she was ready to try again and we began really communicating better...yesterday, I found out she's pregnant...with the other man's child. There's no way it could be mine because we haven't been intimate at all in...well, since I can remember. She doesn't know if she wants to keep it or not...she knows how I feel... we're still married.. I don't know what to do. Right when we began discuss getting back together I told her to be open and honest with me because nothing she can do or say is gonna hurt me any more than the affair did. She sure found a way to up the ante...I'm fucking decimated...my broken heart has been shattered into countless pieces and it feels like there's no coming back. The only thing that could hurt even more, that could rip thes shattered pieces from my chest would be her having that fucking child and raising this token of lies and betrayal alongside my children. If I don't die soon that would kill me more and more every single fucking day until I finally withered away like the spineless, stupid, ignorant, fucking dumbass piece if shit that I am. Fuck. This. Life.  ","1"
"I suffer from extreme bouts of depression, adhd, ocd and anxiety. After nearly 18 years of experience, I have concluded that I am too weak to survive in the modern world. I am incapable of handling simple tasks or following instructions. I am in a state of constant fatigue, no matter how long I sleep. I've been pumped up with various medications and have gone through countless therapies since I was 9 and nothing has helped. I can't bear the thought of living as an adult and having to hold a job. I should just jump off of my balcony and save myself from so much future suffering. ","1"

"Im so sad.  Im tired of being on this planet. Ive been told good things happen to good people and I look at all these spoiled bratty girls with all their attentive doting boyfriends and all their nice things and the whole world bowing down to them and I wonder what I did wrong.  Ive stopped caring for myself these last few months, because its embarrassing to try and still not be good enough.  Its embarrassing to look like I care and I feel like Im begging.  I know no one will pick me.  Theres better, prettier, more normal girls all over the place.  I jut get my face rubbed in it constantly by my guy friends.  Im sick of my family because I was never taught that I am worth loving unless I lived up to all these religious ideals.  Im sick of them because whenever I go over to their house I see everyone doing the normal thing with so much ease and I end up met with so much criticism from my parents.  Everything just seems so easy for everyone.  Meanwhile I dont feel like I belong in this world.  Ive been to two therapists that were condescending and didnt help (one even called me whiny) and been on three medications.  Nothing has helped.  I dont have the emotional energy, time, or money to keep letting these so called professionals screw around with the chemicals in my head, and I dont want to open up to anyone anymore because of how Ive been reacted to.  Im done.","1"
"I had thought of killing myself before, even attempted it. But I got out of that, reasons are being depressed, feel like I cant do anything with my life anymore. But I got away from those reasons, music helped me with it. There are more reasons, anyway sorry for the messed up writing btw, I cant think straight.So the reason isnt even about those anymore. I get anxiety when my father raises his voice. It not even directed at me, hes mad at my sister, and my sister isnt scared at all, shes fighting back if anything. And I feel nervous at him raising his voice, as for why is he mad doesnt matter. This happened before too at school, when my teacher suddenly raised his voice at my one classmate, I suddenly felt nervous and got panic attack, shaky legs and heart beating fast. Now, when my father does it, I dont know what to do. Im sure he wont hurt me or my sister but I just feel like I have to get away. I want to live alone, but I cant do that, and I have to wait for a long time to do that, so is suicide the only option is what Im thinking. It might be a crazy reason but I just feel like I have to get away, I dont want to live here anymore. If I cant live alone yet, suicide is the only option. For now, my reasons for living is still stronger, but who knows when will this get worse. I wasnt raised by my parents, i was raised by my siblings and yup, I got shouted a lot by those people, especially my big brother. Again, sorry for the terrible writing. My mind is just not running well, I cant think straight","1"

"For the past three months I've been unemployed, dropped out of school, gained 20+ pounds, and moved back to my parents house. I haven't spoken to any of my friends for that time too. I have been so embarrassed of my appearance that I've been avoiding everyone and avoiding going out except when I have to. I have struggled with binge eating for years and feel like I have tried everything out there to stop and I stopped confiding in friends because of my continued failure to quit binge eating and stop gaining weight rapidly. This is one of two times that I have ever felt close to suicidal the other time was almost 10 years ago. I am just so scared I will never stop binge eating and even if I did now I still am overweight now and it will take months then to get back to my normal weight. I don't see a way out and I just could use some advice since I have no one in my life I can talk to.","1"
"My girlfriend of 3 years broke up with me about 3 month ago and every time a girlfriend broke up with me i feel absolutely shitty and suicidal. Every time i dont have a relationship i feel empty and sad. There is so much regret that i fucked up our relationship by not beeing there but in the end i know there is no way back to her.I dont have any real friends where i go to college (i have real friends but they live in a different city) and i have the feeling that every relationship i have to other people is superficial and somehow ""not real"". Even though i'm surrounded by people and i have a pretty tight schedul i feel lonely and depressed about my life. I'm sick of wearing this mask of ""beeing well"" on my face and not let anyone know how shitty i actually feel. I'm sick of women that reject me and people that are distant and cold and dont feel like real humans beeings to me. And i'm sick of myself for not beeing able to make people like me and connect with them. I have everything going for me. I do alot of sports, my studies are going well, i'm meeting new people.

"Throwaway account. Things that are contributing to my depression:- I'm a 19 year old female studying full-time at my local community college, due to my inability to work because of my busy school schedule, my boyfriend (21) had to pick up a 50/hr a week job with a one hour commute in order to support us, So he's gone now for 14/15 hours a day 4 days a week, 16/17 hours if there is really bad traffic. I barely see him now. He contributes to a lot of my happiness. - I'm going for a doctorate so I won't even be done with school until I'm 27, and then I'll have to deal with several thousands dollars in student loan debt. I feel such an immense amount of pressure to have a showy career and make an overwhelming amount of money because I grew up incredibly poor with a broken family, in which my dinners either consisted of a handful of otter pops or a $1 Mr.P's pizza split between my two siblings and I. - My boyfriend and I have been together for four years now and were considering eloping next year or the year after, and now I'm scared that i'll get cut off from fafsa If we do so, because it'll change my status to an independent.  - I have no ""girl-friends"", I have tried everything, friendsmatch,  girlfriendsocial, not4dating, strictly platonic forum on craigslist, local subreddits. Nothing has worked. - I have no health insurance, constantly fearful that i'm sick or dying and have no idea. - Sometimes the only ways to get me out of suicidal thoughts is to place myself in a daydream where I have endless money and nothing to worry about, I find myself living in these fantasies more and more lately. - I'm growing increasing terrified of where I live, Someone has been stealing my mail for the last month, a man was murdered on my street a few weeks ago, and a hole was shot in my window with a BB gun, my only form of security is my German Shepherd. - Constantly struggling with anxiety and body dysmorphia, I'm thin now, but can't stop seeing the zit riddled fat kid in the mirror. - I've been having horrible nightmares every night for well over 4 months, so I've been avoiding sleep. The most I've gotten in a single night since this started is 5 hours of rest. It's really starting to have a physical effect on me, having back and side pain along with some killer dark circles on my face. - The ever growing thought that all of this can go away if I just kill myself, or attempt to go off-grid. I'm terrified of dying, yet feel sometimes like it's the best option to avoid pain and disappointment. ","1"
"Alright, So what happened? Well that's a wonderful question.I've been depressed since I was 14, Due to a handful of reasons. Not feeling like I should be alive, Blaming myself for people killing themselves', Not feeling right in this body... Ect. Right?Well I met this girl online and she's really cool, We are dating right now, But the problem is that my folks don't approve of it. They think everyone online is evil! And are just waiting to get me into their windowless van... ANYWAY! I get busted talking to this girl and I lash out saying things like ""Well if I didn't feel lonely here in the house then maybe I wouldn't have to go online"" Which is true! In a house full of people, I feel alone. When I said this my mother replyed with ""Just shut up, You have such a warped sense of reality"" So that's cool. Already hear voices in my head since age 10 from the loss of my aunt, Now I've got that going for me.That's the thing about saying this. When she said that, She had no clue I was alone or that I heard voices, Still doesn't. I dislike sharing my emotions and feelings with her now. But I digress, After this all I got grounded till further notice, Which really means that I get to wait until my folks forget or I pull a magic rabbit out of my ass. Reguardles, I got pissed off and sat in my room... The weird thing is, The voices went quiet, They never tell me to hurt anyone, They are just there, Commenting on things I do, Helping me sometimes... But never mean. But as I sat there in the silence of my anger, I didn't hear them... and I did something that I regret, I wrote my suicide note... I did, And I hate that I did, But I did... Which scares me... I am very anti-self-harm and I hate when people say that they are gonna kill themselves or cut themself or on and on. Fast forward a few days and I am still talking to this girl online, But in secret, Only at night and on a hidden laptop... And It dawns on me that I haven't heard the voices in a long while and so after the call, I ask them, And they were still there, Just being quiet in fear of pushing me over the edge... Which also scared me, If these fake voices can tell when I am upset, But my own mother can't... Who am I to trust?Anyway, I have slowly been recovering until suddenly, Bam, This girl gets upset with me because I haven't been acting like myself and I had been mopey. I explain it all and she bursts into tears calling me a ""Baka"" which she loves to call me even though she knows nothing of the language. I get her to calm down and we sit there for a bit, And she says ""You are strong, I know you are""Those words haven't stopped echoing in my head, The voices say it when I almost give up on something, I hear strangers say it... I hear it everywhere... I don't know why...But if I can get better, With all these negitive forces... So can you, I promise!But I guess I am recovering... I still have my suicide note though, I am going to burn in on my birthday, Just to prove that I lived to see it. Um... So yeah! Thank you for reading this mess of a post.","1"

I havent gone a day this week without suicidal thoughts eating up every second of my free time. If Im not distracted by work or people or tv shows, Im just sitting there in pain. Thinking about death and dying and how nothing in this life is going to matter anyway.And Im really really tired. Im 22 and started having thoughts of death at 10. Its so tiring. I cant do anything but slump my shoulders and let the thoughts ravage my mind. I have no self esteem and I dont believe in myself. I know people can do anything but even if I could put my mind to do something and accomplish something great, Im tired. I dont want to. Im so tired of everything.Im tired of having problems. Im tired of failing. Hell, Im tired of the good stuff. Im tired of people and Im tired of putting effort into anything, because ultimately none of it matters.

"TLDR:  I was abused and neglected as a child both by my family and the church they forced me to attend 6 days a week for 9 years.  As a result I dont trust my own life experience and am pretty sure Im not worth the love and support I need to be healthy.  This has made getting away from my family and making my own way in the world extremely difficult as I cannot distinguish between a persons actual intentions and the way those intentions appear to me when filtered through the survival mechanism that has taken the place of my worldview, making me essentially just as toxic to them as my family was to me.Ill be real with you, Im writing this at 2 am in my bathtub because of that Dan Harmon advice thats been going around on FB compounded with some shit my therapist said a few months ago.  Basically I need to get all my crazy out in words, something Ive been putting off for years because even thinking about it is exhausting so how much worse will it be to actually do it?  Buuuut it turns out holding in 25 years of trauma is exhausting in its own way and I have too much shit to do over the next few years to afford the energy needed to keep my mouth shut on this.On March 22, 2017 my apartment burned down, taking with it my cat who was for a year literally the only living thing that seemed genuinely happy to see me, my birds (one of whom hatched in my bedroom), two friendships (the people are fine but our relationships are not), and nearly all my worldly possessions.  Full disclosure  there were things I could have done to prevent the fire.  My therapist has stressed multiple times that I cannot blame myself for this but the fact remains that I made mistakes that contributed to the deaths of four living things whose lives it was my job to protect.  That cannot be circumvented by any amount of psychotherapy and it frustrates me when people try to tell me not to feel guilty because its not my fault when in practice the only thing missing from essentially arson was an intent to do harm.  Honestly, that may sound dramatic for someone who survived a kitchen fire and should be glad no human beings got hurt, but I can be hard on myself sometimes.  Anyway after the fire I moved back in with my parents with whom my relationship is difficult for reasons I shall now explain.When my mother found out she was pregnant with me (her 4th child, my dads 1st and thankfully last, seriously the fact that I share his genes is reason enough to avoid me like Chernobyl) she told my dad and then took a picture of his reaction, which was to slump against the toilet with the dejected face of someone who has just lost a loved one.  Then the two of them made the conscious decision to develop that photograph and use it as the opener to the baby book they made for me.  Then when I was old enough to understand that I was not only unplanned but extremely unlikely, they showed me the picture of my father being crushed by the knowledge of my existence.  This probably began my irrational hatred of men.  NOTE: BEFORE YOU GET ON MY CASE FOR THIS, REALIZE THAT I RECOGNIZE THIS IS AN IRRATIONAL HATRED.  IT WAS DIFFICULT FOR ME TO REALIZE THIS AND I STILL HAVE TO REMIND MYSELF DAILY.  YOUR MOUTH-BREATHING WILL ONLY MAKE SHIT WORSE.  Realize also that this is not the only reason for this hatred.  This is only the first of many.  I should also note here that my mother was on birth control and they used spermicidal condoms but I still happened.  Some people say this should make me feel special or invincible or some shit but really it makes me feel like the people who made me didnt want me but I was so fucking rude that I imposed anyway.  Shitty hospital staff means my mom also got to guilt me for almost killing her, to which I desperately wanted to scream I WAS BORN AFTER ROE V WADE.  YOU COULD HAVE PAID SOMEONE TO CUT ME OUT OF YOU WHEN I WAS THE SIZE OF A WALNUT AND TOSS ME IN A DUMPSTER FOR FUCKS SAKE. YOU COULD HAVE SUED THE HOSPITAL FOR GROSS NEGLIGENCE, YOU COULD HAVE SUED THE CONDOM COMPANY, THE BIRTH CONTROL COMPANY, YOU COULD HAVE FUCKING SOLD ME.  THERE WERE THINGS YOU COULD DO TO GET RID OF ME IF YOU DONT WANT ME, WAYS YOU COULD HAVE MADE BACK ALL THE MONEY YOU WASTED ON RAISING ME.  HELL, CUT ME A BIG ENOUGH CHECK AND ILL TAKE CARE OF THE PROBLEM OF MY EXISTENCE ON MY OWN.I should also note this baby book contained letters from my sisters.  They are not the only kind things my sisters have said to me, but they are the kindest and the competition was not as steep as one would expect for someone who has had 25 years to come up with something better than I cant wait to meet you, I hope youre a boy.  By the way, I am not a boy.  This is probably good because if I was I would have killed myself for sure.  Not saying males should kill themselves or that I would hate myself more for being male, just saying that I am already aggressive enough and already encouraged enough to bottle my emotions up that any additional pressure to be aggressive or repress shit would have resulted in me shooting up my church/school/cult??? and then myself.  Honestly there were years when I thought that I would end up going that route anyway.So.  Fast forward.  I am here, for worse.  I was an angry baby because they had to break my collarbone to get me out of my mother because if she wanted a c-section she should have found out she was pregnant earlier and nailed down a better doctor (according to a relatives account of what a medical professional may have said).  Not my fault, sure, but still my parents problem, and it probably affected their initial reactions to me as a burdensome piece of shit.  My sisters kinda liked me though, so much so that I realized as an infant that I could fake-cry to get attention.  Once my mother realized how manipulative her four-month-old was she ordered my sisters to stop giving me attention when I sought it out.  Boy fucking howdy did they take that shit to heart.My dad, in a shocking contrast to the abusive behavior he had exhibited toward my mother and half-sisters literally 2 hours after the wedding (Christian, no divorce, she was his bitch now), turned out to be TOTALLY NOT CUT OUT FOR INTERACTING WITH AN INFANT IN ANY WAY.  Sorry, did I say shocking contrast? I meat obvious logical progression of events that happens when your future mother in law says you can stay with her whenever her son gets violently angry and you go ahead and marry the guy anyway and then HAVE A KID WITH HIM.   For me this meant I had to learn how to communicate almost immediately.  I am not exaggerating, nor am I bragging, when I say I was talking fluently at age 2.  The genes that allow this came from my father and they came with a shit ton of mental health issues so I can confidently say I would rather have been born tongueless to a loving family than be ahead of the curve simply because if I did not develop my (genetically assisted) ability to communicate with the much larger, stronger people in my family I could very well have been hurt even worse than I was.  How was I hurt, you ask?  Lots of you wont be surprised.  Some of you may even think I had it easy.  If you fall into the second group then I want you to know that your own abusers deserve the worst kind of suffering for hurting you because I cannot imagine feeling worse than I do now.  If you think I had it easy it is because you have survived some unsurvivable shit and you have my props.  Others among you might be shocked that people can do some of this shit to a toddler and hey, I wish I was one of you lucky unabused niddymugginses.  Unfortunately, my right to be shocked at the cruelty of humans was robbed from me around the time I realized that just because my father handed me something and told me to lick it didnt mean I should.  Dunno if you know how 9-volt batteries taste, but the short answer from a pre-schoolers perspective is it tastes like OOOOWWWW DAD NOOOOOO.  Yes, I realize that technically this instance is an example of someone literally being shocked by the cruelty of another person but let me tell you it was the last time for me both literally and figuratively.Other shit he liked to pull (and was allowed to pull because my mother dissociated for like the first solid 3 years of my life and pretty much let a violent psychopath run her childrens lives) was to chase my half-sisters up the stairs screaming for petty offenses like leaving a light on or bringing food upstairs, tell me I was lying (at age like 2 or 3, mind you) if I told him I was unable to stop crying (he hated the sound of infants crying which is pretty much a human universal because in a normal person it motivates you to satisfy their basic survival needs), and as a second resort would just squeeze my windpipe until I was forced to choose between crying and oxygen.  Fun fact, while you cannot reason with the conscious part of a toddlers brain, literally every bit of nerve tissue in their entire body pays attention when you FUCKING STRANGLE THEM.  There have been times when Ive been crying extremely hard (like the kind where you lose track of what the rest of your body is doing) Ive caught myself choking myself.  Being a red-blooded American Christian household corporal punishment was a mandate from god and if I was bad I got spanked.  2 things though.  First, bad was highly subjective and depended entirely on my parents current mood, and second, spanked herein means Dad had a long day at work and is very tired and wanted to go home and go to bed but instead he has to parent his disgustingly naughty child so he is going to make sure she feels every ounce of irritation he feels at her, her mother, her siblings, and his coworkers.  Huh, reeeeally seems like a certain preschool-aged shithead should have taken her nap like a good girl.Weirdly though, despite making it clear that I basically imposed on my family by daring to be born, my parents were obsessed with me.  When he was not abusing me for the crime of being a normal child my father was teaching me advanced mathematics and getting frustrated because 4-year-olds are really bad at calculus, and once my mother was done dissociating from the terrible environment she willingly forced her kids into she quit her job so she could stay home with me, essentially reducing me to her pet.  By this I mean I was always by her side so much so that my sisters would start saying snide, mean-spirited things about how much time we spent together.  I also mean that she arrested my development either due to not really viewing me as an entire person, or due to wanting to keep me dependent on her longer so she can still feel useful as a person (because her religion reduces woman to either mother or waste of space).  Very little effort was put into potty training me  they would half-assed plop me on the toilet a few times a day and then get frustrated any time I had an accident.  Finally when I was like 3 or 4 they sat me aside, said no one at school would like me if I kept shitting myself, and sort of left me to my own devices after that.  Thankfully I got a handle on it in like 3 weeks because I wanted people to like me.My sisters by this time had started to resent me because 1) I was my fathers only biological kid and the only one of my mothers children to really know my father (I often wish I didnt) and 2) the abuse they were subjected to was different from the abuse I endured.  This is because they were older  if you try to strangle an angry 15-year-old you may very well find yourself murdered and strung up all cool like in NBCs Hannibal.  You can, however, withhold nonessential resources from them such as money for field trips or fees to be on extracurricular sports teams simply because Its not my job to raise you, its your own fathers job.  Im already a saint for feeding you and letting you live in my home.  By the time I was old enough for field trips and extracurriculars I had been so terrified into obedience that I was rewarded for my exemplary behavior by not having to get a job in high school to pay for my own field trips.  I should note now that my father has a PhD and works for a Fortune 500 company so money was not the issue here.   Spite was the issue here.  Whether deliberately or not, he pitted me and my sisters against each other  making sure they knew that they didnt get the things I did because they were bad and I was good, and making sure I kept cooperating with his abusive regime for fear of being treated the way he treated my sisters.  He used to take me to get donuts every Saturday and the only topic of conversation was my sisters and how ungrateful they were and how theyre forever shafted because their dads were deadbeats and how I have to be careful not to be like them.   I shouldnt have been okay with it but I was 5 and I wanted a donut and my dads approval.  You know, normal 5-year-old stuff.Theres a ton more that happened in the home, but were already several pages in and Im starting to ramble.  Ive mentioned with no shortage of resentment bordering on homicidal rage that I was raised Christian, if by Christian you mean biblical literalist, misogynistic, xenophobic quasi-cult run by a soft-headed bitch who kept hiring child molesters despite the fact that with each one she hired 30 people left the community until by the time I was an adult the church/school/Im-gonna-just-call-it-a-cult had collapsed on itself and at least one of the upstanding men of God who liked to rape children got arrested and is going to die in prison.  My understanding from the way the information was presented to me is that I am expected to pity him for this not-even-harsh-enough-to-be-called justice.  Anyway, before I get too into it I should explain why I keep referring to it as a cult.  Literally no one I have talked to about my church experience has said yeah thats typical or what a healthy supportive spiritual community or even all of the things your pastor says actually come from the bible.  It was weirdly misogynistic, even by religious standards.  They loooooved reminding everyone (children included) that Eve fucked humanity over and that means that women should keep suffering through the god-ordained agony of complicated pregnancies and childbirth until they finally had the good grace to bleed out and die.  They literally treated obstetric care as a violation of gods will and by extension my mothers survival of my birth was treated with suspicion and she definitely lost status in the church after I was born.  They also loved talking about how gays are bad because no man should be so cruel to another man as to womanize him, and no one should love and respect a woman enough to elevate her to man status.This is why I have that bolded disclaimer about my issues with men.  I was raised in an environment where I was routinely told by nearly every man in my life that I was worthless and deserved to die a painful but perfectly preventable death.  Perhaps not in those exact words, but again I was a child and they were adults who saw fit to tell a child her life was going to suck and rightly so because of a myth so forgive me for going a bit far in my extrapolation.  It should also be noted that the boys in my church were allowed to be awful to the girls and women with literally no consequences so it wasnt like I could separate out kids being shitty from adults raised in a backward culture doing everything in their power to keep that backward culture alive.  To my very scared, very hurt, very young mind it looked like god created men specifically to hurt women and that for some reason that was the morally correct way of the world and I was evil and against god for thinking that this whole thing was wildly unfair.  My father did not help this because he was a total devils advocate  Well they probably dont look at womens perspectives because they have no reason to.  Women have to because men are in power but women arent so men have no reason to care, so why are you upset at things being unfair?Church wasnt enough for my batshit insane parents so they enrolled me at the affiliated school where I went from weekly vagina-shamings to daily ones.  It also meant I had no escape from the aforementioned shithead boys.  Now that I am an adult I realize that I was also exposed to a shit ton of unnecessarily cruel girls as well, but by that point gender had been solidified in my mind as a zero-sum war for survival.  I thought that if I was willing to compromise and say both males and females can be bad people, that would be viewed as weakness, proof women are bad, and ultimately justification for me to be married off and raped to death if only those goddamned liberals hadnt outlawed a fathers sovereign right to do what he wants to any female objects his uterus-with-an-irritating-maintenance-system gives him.  So basically, certain shitty aspects of a shitty environment were magnified in my life in such a way that I was at constant odds with the golden children who made the morally upright decision of missing an X chromosome.  This meant that the adults thought I was a wicked little upstart who deserved any mistreatment she got, and as such kids were just sort of allowed to be cruel to me.  No one would step in.  One teacher even threatened me with detention if I told her I was being bullied one more time.  Granted, my parents did try to get the principal to do something, but she was too busy interviewing pedophiles for teaching positions at her grade school to give a shit about an unpopular kid with unpopular parents being bullied by the sons of several prominent families in the church.While I was in grade school (in quotes because I later learned none of the teachers were accredited) my older sisters began following my mothers noble tradition of getting knocked up by worthless slag heaps with no jobs, alcoholics with severely arrested development (in the tv show sense of just acting like children despite being fully capable adults), and abusive monsters with just enough clout to pull the youd be nothing without me bullshit that I maintain should be a capital offense.  Of course this meant everyone in my life had to make sure I knew that a womans job is to both please men sexually AND protect her sexual purity for marriage so basically my sisters were godless cunts for not having sex AND godless cunts for having sex AND SUPER EXTRA SATANIC GODLESS CUNTS for getting pregnant.  So, suddenly, halfway through the worst decades of everyone in the households lives, another innocent baby got thrown into the mix.  My niece had the advantage of a mother who could protect her from the worst of my parents crazy, but she still had it rough.  Once she was mad at me when she was like 2 so she unplugged my computer.  This was back when that could cause serious issues on a desktop so when I told my mother and sister they said to tell my dad so he could fix it.  Instead of fixing it he gets 2 inches from my baby nieces face and starts screaming at her like she was a fully-grown coworker who sabotaged the company.  Well, obviously this behavior is unacceptable and the person responsible should be stopped.  EXCEPT by my familys cowardly logic the fact that I was less likely to physically harm anyone I was the one responsible.  What were you thinking telling your dad about that computer, you knew he would freak out on your niece, next time dont you dare do that!As I got older and even more poorly-adjusted to the world and my place in it (if you can even make the argument that I have a place in the world which, if you can, please send it to me because I have not been able to come up with one), I began to model some of my fathers toxic behavior in my relationships with my family.  Not only was I punished for this behavior whereas he was generally allowed to do what he wanted, but my sisters still have not really gotten over it.  Im 25 now and they still act like Im some volatile little hobgoblin who will get angry enough to black out and forget what even pissed me off in the first place in my determination to cause pain.  I do not do that anymore.  I made and am still making conscious efforts to excise every tumorous bit of my fathers influence on my behavior but they will never recognize it except to say something like youre not as bad as you used to be but you need to understand that were expecting you to be better so your current progress really doesnt matter as much as you think it does.Finally I graduated that hellhole of a Jesus school and my indoctrination into the cult of hatred that was my parents version of Christianity was reduced back to the weekly church bullshit.  By this time we have a new misogynist-in-chief in the form of a pastor from Florida who would sit on, throw things at, and on one occasion rip the clothing of confirmation students.  He tried to convince me that womens periods were making them turn to witchcraft and got extremely pissed off when I pointed out that maybe instead of being driven to witchcraft women were being driven away from his god due to misogynists like him.  (Not in those words, obviously.  It was more of a Maybe they are frustrated with the limited opportunities women have to get involved in Christianity and are looking for a faith that allows them more fulfillment and agency which in macho-Jesus-man-speak was basically the verbal equivalent of emptying a menstrual cup directly into his mouth.)  But despite these weekly arguments (and on one occasion almost physical altercation on my end because no grown man should say things like that to a child I swear to nonexistent god I wish I had cut his tongue out and shoved it so far back up his ass that it made its way back to his mouth) wow that sentence got away from me.Anyway, despite these weekly fiascos I was free from a great deal of the mental torture I had suffered for nearly a decade.  Everyone at church commented on how much better I looked since leaving the shitty jesus school which should have been a huge clue for my parents to stop dragging me to church BUT they continued forcing me to cult meetings every week until one extremely terrible Sunday on which my father exposed his ass to me in a 7-eleven parking lot and then pulled me out of church 5 minutes before I was supposed to do the reading in front of the whole congregation to yell at me that he mooned me as a sign of contempt.  I dont even remember what I did to piss him off so much that he felt the need to treat his only child with contempt but there you go.  Needless to say I burst into tears, told the elder I couldnt do the reading, got chewed out by the elder for being such a flaky teenaged GIRL, and stormed into the parking lot to cry next to my old crying tree from grade school.  Oh yeah, I spent so many recesses hiding from the other kids and crying that I even had a favorite tree to sit near when I did so.  Should be noted that I was not allowed to bring books or sketchpads or to stay inside with the other teachers or literally anything besides hide in the bushes to avoid having kickballs thrown at my head.  Anyway, after the awful church disaster my mother pulled me aside to tell me she is disappointed in me and that I am no longer welcome at church until I fix my attitude which on one had was great because no more religiously-motivated-hate seminars but on the other hand stung a lot.  For one, rather than honor my request to not be brought to an environment that causes me pain she waited until that pain bubbled over and then punished me by revoking my churchgoer status.  For another, while I no longer believe in the existence of any higher power, at the time it sounded like she was so sick of my behavior (but curiously not my fathers behavior) that she was willing to gamble my immortal soul on my ability to magically, at the age of 17, while simultaneously dealing with some heavy shit at school (unrelated, not long-term traumatizing, really a funny story now that Im older), to change her attitude in a world where she had only had two attitudes modeled  aggressively hateful or so passive I might as well be dead.  Even today she still believes in all that and keeps pressuring me to go to church.  I reminded her last time she did this that she was the one who told me not to bother coming to church anymore and she insisted she had no recollection of this event.  She has no recollection of a lot of events from my childhood, which if she is lying is some fucking grade A gaslighting on her part because therapists have gotten soooooo fucking sick of telling me that from what theyve heard of my life they can confidently say that at least some of the abuse actually happened.  I still have difficulty sometimes with really confronting the fact that yes, bad things were done to me as a child and yes, those things were bad enough to be considered abuse and no, I am not delusional or manipulative or some other kind of awful monster acting with intent to harm my family.Anyway, once I no longer had to go to church people started commenting on how much healthier I looked.  Hooo boy can you bet that not a single person in my life made the connection between me leaving the cult and me gleaning some happiness out of the world.  How did I get that glow, that bounce in my step, that smile?  Its a fucking mystery, lets ask god what happened.  College hit and I finally accepted what I kind of knew all along  I have no fucking business with organized religion, I disagree with the church on every important social issue, and I legitimately think that no one has been able to demonstrate with any degree of confidence that there are such things as gods.  I also developed a passion for animal care and began applying to graduate programs where I could, without getting too technical, work with abused animals who display behavior issues like aggression towards humans because these animals were raised in unhealthy environments by humans.  Its a little clich, I know, but I need to work with living things whose anger stems from pain because that is me all over.  I feel like they dont judge anyone for being angry at abuse because they themselves are angry at it.  I never get that feeling with humans.  Theyre sad for me, and if theyve suffered theyre often sad for themselves as well.  But they never get so angry that they can look into the eyes of the person feeding them with such intense rage because just because someone feeds you doesnt mean they give a shit about your overall wellbeing, then proceed to attempt to scare that human (the one with the food) away.  I know that feeling.  Ive been so hurt by people that my first instinct is to scare them away first, even (dare I say especially?) if they were only attempting to provide some form of help or support.  For so long I felt like shit because I do this but I figured if I can look into the face of an animal that has a completely understandable desire to murder me and still want nothing but the best for that animal, then maybe it is possible for humans to be kind.  Maybe it is even possible for them to be kind to me.Well, after a round of rejections, some real world work experience, and a second attempt at applying, I was accepted into my dream graduate school.  Two weeks later the aforementioned apartment fire occurred, and for 3 months after I was too borderline suicidal to appreciate that I had actually accomplished something pretty fucking cool.  My parents tried to be supportive but as you may have guessed they cannot do that thing even if they try.  Also they can only keep up the attempt for a week or so so when it turned out that trauma doesnt just evaporate they threatened to have me committed.A little bit of therapy and a whole lot of apathy later and I managed to get back on civil terms with my parents and they helped me move out of state (tearfully, in my mothers case).  Now Im here, finally over a thousand miles away from the toxicity of my childhood and integrating into a world where abuse is not the norm has been almost as bad as the abuse itself.  People do not understand my preparedness to fight.  Not argue, not debate, not even get a little snippy.  Full on trial-by-combat let the Many Faced God decide who is right and who should have fucking thought before she made that snide comment if she wanted to continue living FIGHT.  My therapist said it had to do with an overactive sympathetic nervous system, essentially my family pressed caps lock on my fight or flight response then pried off the key so I can never really come back down from thinking I am in perpetual danger.  Oftentimes this means some stressed out white man says something offhand and slightly rude, but not meant as a personal attack, and if I can I freak out and threaten his life and if I am not in a position where that would be feasible I glare at him and maybe knock something over for emphasis.  Not necessarily healthy, but satisfying to know that someone who probably never had anything truly terrible happen to him knows, for at least a split second, that if he fucks with me HE DIES SLOWLY AND PAINFULLY AND DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF ANY LIVING RELATIVES WHO MIGHT BE ALSO CAUSED PAIN BY HIS DEATH BECAUSE FUCK HIM AND ANYONE WHO DARES THINK HE IS A WORTHWHILE HUMAN BEING BECAUSEWORTHWHILEHUMANBEINGSDONOTTREATMELIKEMYPARENTSDID.A dangerous attitude since guns are easier to obtain here.  On that note, while I want a gun (mostly to defend myself against gun-rights-activists. Call it hypocrisy and I call you dead-to-me) I realize that I am probably more likely to use it on myself than on any of the other people who deserve it.Anyway.  Im here, I dont know who the fuck I am because for the past 25 years I havent really been allowed to just BE.  I was always told my emotions were either factually or morally incorrect so now when I have a feeling it feels like air raid sirens going off and I literally have to remove myself from situations that normal, well-adjusted, societally worthwhile people can handle.  And I cant really trust anyone to care about my pain because, in the words of my pernicious half-sister No one has to be nice to you.  Note that she said this while I was sitting in the drivers seat of my car seriously contemplating revving it up to 60 and crashing into a brick wall.  Apparently this was supposed to convince me to be happy and live my life.  For some reason no one in my family realizes that I need emotional support sometimes, like when I lose all my possessions and my pets and the security of a roof over my head to a traumatic disaster such as a fire.  The worst parts of my suicidal depression were happening when I was trying to deal with insurance and the cleaning company and property management was doing everything in their power to threaten me and bully me into what? I dont know because whenever I called to ask what exactly I need to do to get them to stop exacerbating my desire to drown myself they would ignore my calls.  How supportive was my family during this time? Well, do me a favor and dunk a loaf of wonderbread in water then see how well it supports things.Ah, I should also note that the sister who told me no one has to be nice to me has also told another suicidal sister of mine to stop talking about it and just do it.  She is a schoolteacher, this psychotic, compassionless shitstain.  She is a school teacher as a backup career because she could not hack it as a counsellor or therapist.  Probably because she kept telling suicidal people who took the terrifying step of reaching out for help that if they really want to die they should just fucking do it aleady.So yeah, I dont trust people to care about my wellbeing because if my own family cant, why should anyone else?  Also, the fact that I need care means that I am incapable of providing it and therefore I am a drain on every social relationship I maintain.  People say I should focus on caring for myself but 1) if I am worthless why should I care about me and 2) if I do care about me, my opinion of me is worthless because I am worthless.  No amount of thinking can get me past that  from a social standpoint I am a terrible investment and while I wish someone would be my friend I honestly cant blame them for not wanting to.  I feel like I need someone to see some good in me before I can say that I have anything good in me and not have it feel like a manipulative lie I tell myself to excuse myself from the terrible effects my existence had on my family.  But because I realize that youd have to be crazy to want to help me I have a hard time trusting people who show me kindness because they are either insane or plotting something or just generally nice to everyone.  Goddamn I wish I knew how it felt to have someone be nice to me because I am simply special to them.  Not special to the world in general, I just want one single person to rank me as one of the important people in their lives.  I also cant set boundaries because my father treated boundary violation as an Olympic sport.  I dont know how I feel about hugs because while I recognize I probably need one, my father used to yell, hit me, then pull me into a crushing, painful smothering attempt he called a hug and refused to let me go no matter how much I kicked, screamed, and tried to pull away.  So basically my modes are Look at me and I will gnaw your face off like I am a captive chimpanzee and you are a moron who thinks its a good idea to get in the face of a captive chimpanzee or sure, do whatever, want my kidney while youre at it?This means that I can say terrible shit about professors to my classmates  Judging from how she refused to answer any clarifying questions on our debate prompts combined with the fact that several people have warned me she loves starting drama I think that this whole quarter was her trying to pit us against each other for her own gain and I am really glad I will never take another class with her.  Furthermore, if she is so concerned with ethics then why is she planning all this contentious bullshit in our first quarter where we need to make good impressions on each other?  Then when they say I should be ashamed for thinking that, let alone saying it, I roll over and say theyre absolutely right, my perspective on the world is cruel and factually wrong if not straight-up delusional.Well one of them has taken this as permission to joke about the fact that my home burned down.  I dont know how to confront her on it without screaming at her that she had better goddamned drop out and move away if she knows whats good for her, her parents, her siblings, and anyone else who ever gave her an ounce of support or approval.  Granted, I made a couple jokes about it both as a coping mechanism for myself as I am the one who put the work into not just shriveling up and dying over the summer and as a way to introduce the topic of hey I am coming down from the most traumatic experience of my adult life and Im doing a thousand miles away from the people who should have been there to support me so people understand why Im such a mess.  I guess Im just going to have to say it in those words because clearly the only people who understand that trauma is bad for a persons health are others who have been through trauma.  Which.  Wow.  If you cant understand that I lost my home and am laughing really loudly about it because the alternative is sobbing while clutching a pillow like a rejected Harry Harlow experiment then your problem isnt lack of trauma, its lack of basic human empathy.If you made it this far, thanks.  If you skipped over most of it, understandable.  Its 10 pages single spaced after all.  Im probably going to print this out later to take to my schools counselling center because its easier than trying to articulate this whole mess in front of a stranger.TLDR:  I was abused and neglected as a child both by my family and the church they forced me to attend 6 days a week for 9 years.  As a result I dont trust my own life experience and am pretty sure Im not worth the love and support I need to be healthy.  This has made getting away from my family and making my own way in the world extremely difficult as I cannot distinguish between a persons actual intentions and the way those intentions appear to me when filtered through the survival mechanism that has taken the place of my worldview, making me essentially just as toxic to them as my family was to me.","1"
"I drink a lot, mostly alone. This amplifies my feelings but I do it so much alone that I've become dependent. My friends rarely hit me up and I feel like I only reach out to them. No one will hire me. I'm starting to feel discouraged after a month and a half. I love traveling the world but this has been cut short as a result. I have severe social anxiety, don't like to talk to people on the phone even with issues like my own. I tried the suicide livechat but was on hold for over an hour and gave up. I don't know what to do. I've worked in customer service for the past seven years and want to try something new, the problem is I have all this free time but I feel worthless and feel like I should know what I want to do by now.

I've tried to kill myself multiple times over the last couple days as well as this morning. I felt like trying again most of my time at work and then towards the end of my shift it felt as if this burden was magically removed for no apparent reason. I don't know if this has ever happened to anyone else? It makes me feel happy obviously because I don't feel the pain I felt before but at the same time I know myself well enough that something could trigger those feelings again.I want to start seeing a therapist but I feel like it wont help as much if they don't know the full scope of my issues. At the same time I feel like it would seem weird for me to go to the hospital now when I'm feeling perfectly calm. Not really sure what I should do?Edit: I'm also really hesitant to be hospitalized because I just moved to a new city kind of far from home and started a new job and I'm afraid if I have to stay in the hospital for too long I'll lose my job.

So for my birthday I decided to have a girls night out and invited almost all those girls who said we should hang out. Only my sister and one of the other showed out of 15 people. A few message me back saying that they had work which was understandable. My boyfriend also decided to have a guys night the same night. I was so disappointed that instead of staying out till midnight like planned I went home super early. I pass out and wake up to my boyfriend ranting about his awesome night and how all those who I invited out were there. Im so disappointed and feel like a failure and like I have no friends.

"I say another because I've found myself posting to this subreddit a lot recently. I mean let me go over what's happened recently.So Thanksgiving my parents went shooting early in the morning, and when I woke up they had come back and left again to go shopping. But my step dad left all of the guns out. When I saw them I kind of like, blacked out right? My whole lead up into Thanksgiving (along with Thanksgiving day) was met only with turmoil and despair in the circus of my mind. So I just like almost lost control of myself. Like I wasn't doing this with purpose, I just was moving. I loaded a 1911 smith & wesson (a beautiful one at that) and I just held it in my hands for a bit. I just felt so powerful. Like I held agency over my life, in the chaotic storm that it is. But I couldn't do it. Once I really realized why I was doing this, I just felt afraid right? So I unloaded the bullet and I have it to this day. Maybe as a reminder as to how close I was? Or maybe if I plan on using it again? Who knows?Anyways, since Thanksgiving, things haven't gotten much better. My anxiety has been through the roof. I've been losing sleep. I'm so afraid of those I love just leaving me. My girlfriend especially I've felt would leave me. For those who don't know (I've posted these things before I am almost a regular here lmao) my girlfriend left me when suicidal thoughts and tendencies began creeping in. But she eventually went through it and realized what she did and we've been dating again.But I don't know.My whole week has been filled with fear and anguish. I've been isolated. The little contact with people I had was short lived and when it ended I was brought back to my prison. I've come to realize that I don't think I want to kill myself. But living has become so hard and tiring and strenuous that dying just seems like the best option.I've been afraid and alone and lack of contact has become hard. My parents don't understand and life has just been sucking. I got a new antidepressant so I'm hoping it works but I don't know dudes life has just gotten so tough.","1"
"Don't really know why I'm posting this, I've found myself scrolling through this subreddit the past month perhaps trying to find something to help me deal with my thoughts.I've struggled with depression and anxiety since I was about 10, I had a pretty bad childhood with my parents having a violent relationship and separation. My dad was extremely abusive mentally and I can honestly say I don't remember being happy as a child. When I was 17 he committed suicide and that really affected me more than I ever let on. There were so many things left unspoken and to this day being 26 I can honestly it haunts me every day. I've been prescribed antidepressants so many times I couldn't tell you the actual amount. I take them for a month or 2, things pick up in my life and I stop and then my life turns upside down somehow. It's been a continuous cycle for the majority of my life, I know I probably don't help myself but I'm just extremely tired of going through the cycles that's it's drained all my desire to live.Coming up a month ago, my girlfriend of 2 years broke up with because she no longer feels the same. We spent every day together, she was my best friend, honestly my soulmate. You need to love yourself I understand that but she genuinely was my only reason for happiness. I've tried so hard to try and get her back, I've finally taken myself to therapy to try and battle my demons but she can't change how she feels. Honestly, I respect her decision but I can't deny it's left me heartbroken and a mess. I've tried so hard to appreciate the time I was fortunate enough to have with her, I've listened to how time heals but it doesn't change how I feel and I don't think it ever will.There have been plenty of times where I've contemplated just ending everything but right now it scares me to think about how serious my thoughts are. Bar the fact I have a loving mother, step dad and brothers, if it wasn't for the pain it will cause them I'd of already done it.There's so much more I could say about myself and as previously mentioned I don't even know why I'm writing this. I'm a private person and I guess I thought it could help me have second thoughts on following through with these dark desires.Thanks for reading.","1"

She finally carried it out last week Monday. She chose the best method it seems. Anyway I empathize with her reasons. I feel sorry for her parents. They love her so much. In her journal she added a playlist of the music she'd been listening to. I've been listening to it for a while now and the music really resonates with me. It's a really good list. It's a little eerie listening to the music she was listening to just before she died, but I'm feeling it. ","1"

"hi i don't know if this is the right place to post this but i don't really have any close friends to tell. i'll try to make this short but i talk a lotlong story short in elementary school i started cutting myself, having suicidal thoughts, all the way until now (i'm 18). i got diagnosed with anxiety and depression and an eating disorder last year when i went to get help, so i started taking prozac and went to two different therapists and psychiatrists. i felt a little better, but i didn't feel all the way better and i still don't.i work with young kids as a part-time job and last night i just had a panic attack in front of a few of my co-workers. i couldn't control my breathing or my shaking or my crying. i left and didn't tell them why, but it was because sometimes seeing sad kids makes me cry. because what if they are secretly suicidal like i was their age and still am? or dealing with an eating disorder? or something.for some reason last night after that mess i lost all hope. i made a suicide note to my parents, went to the walgreens next door to buy some pills (i was actually crying when i bought the pills but the cashier didn't acknowledge it), and just cried in my car for two hours outside my work. i felt like i made everyone sad and i was a failure who didn't deserve to live because i am so miserableso when i'm sad i like to take long drives. so i took the super super SUPER long way home around 6pm. i didn't feel well. i screamed ""I JUST WANT A FUCKING SIGN"" and then when i pulled up to the next stoplight, a woman, her husband/boyfriend, and their baby girl walked in front of me on the crosswalk and smiled. i smiled back.my biggest dream is to be a mother. and that sounds kind of stupid, i guess, but that's why i work with kids. anyways i took that ""sign"" as just a stupid coincidence so a few minutes later i decided to pull into my old elementary school park and just sit there. then, i turned on the radio for the first time that night to my favorite station and heard this song i never heard before by dashboard confessional and the lyrics were this: ""And there's still a kidSomewhere // That needs to hear this // That somebody cares // That somebody knows // Who's tired of bleeding // And battered // And being torn up // Just pick yourself up // It's time to go""basically i was like wtf. okay. toughen up, bitch. i drove away from the park, a little... spooked? i don't know what the word is. and i basically said something to myself like ""who the fuck cares, dashboard confessional""and AGAIN i stop at the last stop sign just before my house and a different couple with their baby walks by.then i realized that i care.this is really cheesy sounding i guess but i realized that i don't want to DIE, but i'm having trouble living. my therapist is not the right match for me, specifically, so instead of feeling like an idiot because i feel like a trained professional can't help me, i think i'm going to ask my parents to find someone new. it's not my therapist's fault or my fault, i realized, it's just to do what's best for me i have to find someone who can really really help meyeah sorry that was long i just wanted to get that out really badly","1"
"I have been having an emotional breakdown over the last week as I have realised I am an awful person. I cheated on the girl I love near the beginning of our relationship, lied about it, and desperately tried to cover my tracks. I manipulate people into getting information out of them or to help me. I have caused everyone so much pain, I don't move forwards only backwards. I'm a waste of space, a waste of life, a waste of money and resources and food. I would rather die than hurt my girlfriend and have her know I did that to her.. she deserves so much better than that, I can't have her doubt herself she's too wonderful for that. I don't have the love within myself for myself to keep myself going after everyone inevitably will leave me when they realise how shit I am. I don't want to be around to witness when that happens. It hurts far too much. Life is so painful, if I were born 300 years ago I would have died in infancy. I'm weak, a coward, natural selection would have come for me already if modern medicine wasn't keeping me strong. I don't deserve to live I feel like I deserve to suffer, I'm thinking of just staying in bed and starving and dehydrating myself to death, and maybe overdose when the pain gets too much","1"

"Ive been given a perfect life. My parents love me, Ive always done well in school. When I set a goal I pretty much accomplish it. I have never really wanted for anything. I am the last person to be having these thoughts.Despite my privilege, I make stupid stupid stupid mistakes. I accidentally do things that should be in every way avoidable.Today I was in a car crash. It was my fault. A stupid mistake that could have killed someone. It was only through luck no one was hurt, but I shouldnt need to be lucky. With the resources Ive been given I should be better than this. I should be smarter than this.But Im not. Ive failed.I was not intoxicated when the crash happened, but that just makes it worse because it means my best self (not drunk/high) isnt good enough.I must see this situation as if someone had died because of my idiocy because it is just dumb luck that no one was hurt. I dont know how I can get out of bed tomorrow, let alone ever drive again.Ive always been a little sad just due to the fact that I choke, fuck up, or make a mess when I have so much of an advantage from a privileged life over others who seem to do just fine. The crash seems like kind of a wake up call and forces me to confront the fact that with this pattern, I will never be something great or special, and from my generally nihilistic point of view I now not only am meaningless, but I only have the possibility of harming those who have found meaning in their lives.I need a way to think about all this. I was resigned with being pointless, but if I fuck up and hurt someone, that will be the only real thing that has ever occurred in my life because it effected someone who does still care about their own existence. Im not sure why I should keep trying when I have proven to myself that I will only fail.I feel silly posting here, part of me says stop whining and go on... but I wouldnt resist the end at this point.Im not just worth it.Thanks for reading. Im glad I put my thoughts in writing.","1"

"I've been experiencing a growing urge to kill myself.  It's difficult to deal with.  There have been multiple times where I tied up a noose, looped it around my neck, and sat down, dropping all my weight on the rope.  The first time, it was just kind of hard to breathe, but that was because I wasn't putting much load on the rope.  Each time I'd tie it a little higher, and push a little harder, now almost to the point where I completely lose consciousness.  The thing is, I have no clue why I do this.  I have a pretty good life, I shouldn't have anything to complain about.  I'm pretty spoiled for a sixteen year old.  I've tried to ""trace my steps,"" coming up with ideas for what could be making me so depressed.  I had one really good explanation in my mind for a while, which made me happy for a few days - no suicidal thoughts.  However, I recently started feeling like that might not be the answer.  What if I went through all the trouble of fixing that thing and found out that it did nothing?  Right now, it's the only thing I have to lean on, but I'm tearing it to pieces in my own mind.  I'm feeling suicidal again.  Instead of thinking of ways to help myself, I'm thinking of ways to kill myself.  There's quite a few I can go through with without even leaving my house.This post isn't meant to draw attention to myself.  It's more for my own personal benefit.  I feel like I should be telling someone about this, but the thought of that is horrifying.  It's much easier to reach out to complete strangers than to those you trust the most.","1"

"I feel the only way out of this meaningless existence is suicide. I went to public school until third grade when my mom met my stepdad, he was a conspiracy theorist who thought school just brainwashes kids to be followers of the elite corporations, he was unemployed with no money when he moved in and stayed that way.He convinced my mom to homeschool me,which she only did once a week until sixth grade. After that nothing. I never had any interactions with anyone else other than them my whole childhood.When I turned twenty I miraculously passed the GED test and got a drivers license and was kicked out of the house by my stepdad. I was homeless and got a minimum wage jobs and roommates that never worked out, because I had no social skills and still don't. I always had anxiety and depression over my working, education and social skills.So I broke down and tried suicide, got community mental health and approved for disability and section 8.I have been living off this for a few years, but still have no friends and can't enjoy anything. Not even movies or music because I see people living full meaningful lives in movies and singing about love in songs.I feel like I can't go on living as an uneducated, unskilled thirty year old on disability with no prospects of a career or social life in sight.

"I am 20, about to be 21 in a few days. My life wasn't so bad a few years ago. I was in university, I had two decent friends and I felt like I had a life ahead of me. Maybe not a great life but a life nonetheless. I felt like a person.Things started going downhill about 2 years ago. Having become slightly more independent than I was in high school, I lost what little interest in school I had left. I skipped class all the time, hardly ever studied, failed classes repeatedly and eventually flunked out. And I got extremely depressed. This part is pretty much all my fault. I could pin my lack of motivation in school on a number of different things including family problems and my social anxiety but I know those are just excuses. In reality I just didn't try hard enough. I cut contact with my friends out of pure shame, and since then a few of my old high school friends have messaged me wanting to catch up but I don't respond because I don't want anyone to know what a loser I've turned into. I don't get along with anyone in my family. I don't speak with my siblings despite living with one and in close proximity with another. They all see me as the failure of the family. And my mother and I have a bad relationship. I try to make it work but it never does. She is closed-minded, shallow, overbearing (not in a caring way but in a controlling way), and extremely judgmental. She never fails to make me feel horrible about myself. She doesn't listen to what I say. She makes cutting comments about my appearance, things I can't change like my skin color or my hair texture. And growing up she would always tell me I wasn't a Canadian, despite being born here and having never lived anywhere else, and that people here were taught to hate me because of my skin color and my religion. So I grew up feeling like I didn't belong anywhere. And I still feel that now.Then about a year and a half ago, I lost faith in my religion. This was a huge blow to my psyche and I'm still dealing with the fallout. I had such strong faith in God and I used to pray to him every night to send help. And suddenly the realization that help wasn't coming crashed down on me. A big part of my former religion was maintaining family ties. And even despite all the problems I had with my family, I held on to hope that one day we would be reconciled. And even if we weren't, at the very least I would do it to please God. I don't believe in God anymore, and as such I have no reason to keep contact with a family that I've come to realize is extremely toxic to me. So now I have nothing. I'm not a person anymore. And there is not a single person on this earth who cares about me for who I am. I never was bothered by it before. I didn't start feeling the crushing emptiness until just recently. It's because the anger has died down and I feel nothing anymore. Or maybe it's because I had participated in online communities that gave me the bare minimum human connection I needed. But it's not enough anymore. I feel the emptiness stronger than ever. The floodgates have all been unlocked, and the pain is simply unbearable. I want to take a knife to my chest and rip out my insides. I don't look in mirrors anymore and I don't remember the last time I looked another person in the eyes. I hate who I am. And I want to die.

"First of all, apologies for the extremely lengthy post.I'm 27 years old, not that it should matter, mental health is an issue at any age. I have no friends to confide in and my family is broken and the ones that listen don't offer great advice.5 years ago I tried to take my own life by jumping off a bridge, I fell about 200 ft, hit water and was instantly knocked unconscious. I woke up in hospital the next morning, surrounded by doctors and my girlfriend from the time.I've had a rough past, all kinds of abuse, sexual, physical, mental, alcohol and drugs.The tipping point for that episode 5 years ago was when I fell in love with said girlfriend at the time (Who, actually, wasn't _quite_ my girlfriend yet.) and caught her with her 'ex'. We were a thing at the time but hadn't made anything official.Small things like that have been known to have a massive effect on me.Well /r/SuicideWatch, I would like to say I'm an enlightened man. But unfortunately I left that woman 5 months ago. Things weren't working and we weren't happy anymore. But rather than try to fix it, I ran away. Over the past few weeks, I've began to miss ""Christine"" (name changed for anonymity), really, very badly.I found out that she has a new boyfriend with whom she is happy, on the 28th of November.I went out for my final walk.Unfortunately, though I had planned to jump from a bridge, I neglected to think about which one, and as it turns out, there are 5 or 6 within a 4 square-mile radius of my home. None of them are high enough.And so I'm sat again. 3 words revolving around my head, over and over. Except now I'm thinking of various other methods.The point of my post wasn't so that people would read it. I know people will. And I know most people will probably try to console me. ","1"
"Every day I walk up a bridge next to my dorm that is incredibly long and incredibly high over pavement. Its the only way to get to and from classes.

That, and this week is finals, and thats not helping me any.Ive been in college for one full semester and I dont have any friends. Thats not just a thing I saying, its not I mean I have one not so close person I talk to sometimes. I literally dont talk to anybody outside of school activities and one club Im part of. Ive showed interest in spending more time with people, but to no avail. I have friends from back home and we all hang out together when we have breaks, but thats vary rarely, and theyre all successfully making friends and engaging in romantic relationships. Not me. I dont know how.Besides that, Im fat, Im ugly, Im not getting good grades, and I have no motivation to change those things. Today I got out of bed at 5:00 pm and got back in bed at 9:00. Ive eaten maybe 6 times this week total. Im just a mess. I cant afford a therapist, and I cant talk to anyone about this because my parents dont believe in depression and my friends usually make it about themselves. Closest thing I can get to support is blabbing about it on the internet to strangers hoping for some kind of supporting comment or anything.I guess thats all I have to say. I guess thanks for being a subreddit.","1"

"As I type this, I'm shaking with anxiety.I've been with a girl who I've always considered the love of my life. I feel like I'm wrong because I now realize I am incapable of truly loving anyone. I am a bad person, and all I'm going to do is hurt anyone I get close to.I have been seeing my girlfriend for nearly two years. Things have been rougher lately and I feel like I've been disconnecting and going into a bad place. She's been nothing but caring to me, and her family treats me like another son and I know I've just ruined all of that. I have never cared for someone in my life as much as I have cared for her, yet I've hurt everyone I truly care about in my life and she's only going to be the next.I have a coworker who I never even really considered. She's new to where I've been working for 5+ years. She's had a rough life and I've tried to be a friend, but everything happened so fast...I went to a local jam with a friend of mine, and afterwards two different coworkers invited me over. I only stayed for about an hour, they brought out cocaine (which I used, albeit for the first time in months) and drank more than I usually do by far. I left, went back to my house and sat down for a while but my mind was racing. My coworker (who's house is walking distance) invited me over to smoke some weed. I knew her boyfriend was out of town, but I didn't even consider the possibilites. I was fucked up reddit, I have a problem that I thought I had under control but I now realise I have absolutely no control over my habits.We smoked, and looked at stars and talked for a while longer than I had realized. She got closer and we ended up kissing and getting handsy. I did not have sex with her, but I don't feel any less guilty about it.I didn't like it. It felt wrong the entire time. I knew what I was doing but I felt like I was in too deep. I wasn't even turned on. I just wanted it to be over. I told her I didn't want to have sex and left shortly after a cigarette.It's not alright. I am freaking the fuck out. I feel like killing myself. I know the truth will come out, and I need to address it tomorrow. I sent her a text saying we cannot do this anymore and haven't heard back. I know this is going to go south. I know I've completely fucked over the trust of the woman I love. I feel disgusting, deceitful, and completely undignified. I want to vomit.I feel like the only option is to tell her what happened. I could try and hide it but it would fucking consume me. I know it's ruined one way or another. I just don't want to hurt her any more than I'm already going to. This is the only time I've felt connected deeply to someone and their family has treated me like a human being and I do not deserve it. I've blown it for a one night fucking mistake.I'll wake up tomorrow and read any replies and figure out how to go forward from here. My grammar is awful, but I needed to get this out of me. It's eating at me.I've felt suicidal before but tonight I just feel like I can't deal with the remorse. I hate myself for what I did and I hate myself for the pain it's going to cause.Thank you for taking the time to read that, I really need someone to set me straight.","1"

"Im in a bad situation. Im a freshman in college, and after a recent break-up with my boyfriend, I have realized that I had no other friends. He ended it with me, and Im still very upset. What do I do? Are there any people on here whove been friendless before and can explain how they got out of it? I want advice to keep in mind before I start the spring semester.Background: Ive always had borderline antisocial tendencies. I was a loner in high school. I have a tendency to serially date in order to always have an emotional support system due to my lack of friends.I am very mistrustful of other people and tend to assume the worst (theyre only talking to me because of X, That thing they said must have been passive aggressive, theyre only interacting with me to take pity on me, etc).I have very low motivation and have trouble taking initiative.My friendlessness is something Ive taken for granted, because in high school, the longer schoolday occupied my time, so I was usually too exhausted by the time I got home to have wanted or been able to do much anyway, and because I was much closer to my siblings back then. But now that Im in college, its really starting to hit me. I need somebody to hold me when Im shaking, or to talk to me when Im crying, but I have done nothing to deserve it, and am all too aware of it. My dorm is a complete mess, and Ive started to forget to eat/only eat things that are easy to eat. I found myself intentionally bruising up my arms against the frame of my bed. I feel like my life is going downhill and spinning out of control, and I dont know who to talk to or what to do. I feel like a pitiful little creature. ","1"
"The sheer force of will I have to put into getting through each day and pursuing things to improve my life is extreme, and yet my situation stays the same. I'm miserable.

I want to be happy, but it's always just out of reach. I am still painfully lonely and I'm just not passionate about anything.

Hell, I may even get little pockets of happiness here and there, but the price is too great, the suffering endured to have them is too much and the joy brought is too few and far between. My ability to cope is slowly but surely wearing thin.The only thing stopping me from killing myself, that has been stopping me all these years, is knowing that the people I love would be heartbroken if I did. (Just one look through /r/SuicideBereavement can shred me up inside, sigh) But... Can I continue to endure a lifetime of suffering to [spare them the pain](https://i.imgur.com/SJAv5ZX.jpg)?

However, I hope something will take me over so that I'll still do it impulsively, cause in the end all I really want is the pain to stop.. But life is so beautiful. And my family is so precious. It's complicated.","1"
"Life is depressing from every angle you look at it. Wars, hunger, criminals, corrupt politicians, etc. you dont get to choose many of your life aspects and you dont really matter in the universe nor will you ever do any real difference. or maybe you will, but thats somewhat unlikely. very unlikely for me because im lazy and i dont care about many things. Im a sad person, i hate myself, i self destruct myself. i have no will to do anything. so, literally asking, why do people always think suicide is such a horrible thing? why do they always tell you not to kill yourself? why shouldnt i do it? because you can get better and life is beautiful? i dont think its the same for everyone. different people, different circumstances. not everyone gets better. some people never did. i dont think i will. so, why shouldnt i do it? give me something to think about, please.

"anyone want to talk? suicidal feelings are getting worse over the past few weeks. I made an attempt last week but I think I may have just done minor damage and slept for 3 days straight while dry heaving. i feel like I should figure out how to hang myself. i feel like a terrible person for indulging in this. my mind just torments me and nothing seems to alleviate it. it just says the meanest things to me. every time I think I can be positive, my mind says something really horrible to me. I just feel dead. I feel like this is not life. It just fucking sucks and I want to die. I've been suicidal for 18 years but I really have no hope at this point. My body is scarred beyond recognition from self harm. I'm aging. I keep trying to take various handfuls of pills and hope that something just fails because I'm a fucking pussy. I've been hospitalized so I can't get a gun or anything. Jumping out my window seems really fucked up to put more people through. I know this will hurt my family. That's not why I am doing it. I am in pain. I don't even know if I really want to die, but I keep making choices that seem to lead me down that road. Some days I overdosed I really thought I was going to die, and some days I was like ""no, I didn't mean to"" and other days I am like ""finally, peace"". I am a terrible person for this. Aren't I?","1"

"I'm a 24 yr old male, fucky mental health since age 13. The last few nights I've thought to myself that I should really go to the ER. I've spent every night for a while now crying and desperately restraining myself from self harm or suicide. However, I feel like if I were to seek help right now, my mom would crumble.Tomorrow is my mom's best friend's 7 year old daughter's funeral. She died a week ago. My mom has damn near planned the whole funeral and it's breaking her. I feel like if she had to deal with her son's treatment on top of that that it would absolutely destroy her.I've managed to only do light self harm in the last several months. However, I can't deal and keep everything internalized anymore. I need professional help. I want to die so badly. I'm sick of irrational despair and epileptic seizures. But I can't die because it would hurt tons of people. I'm trying to wait several days until after the funeral so my mom will be emotionally equipped to handle me admitting I'm suicidal, but i'm not sure I can hold out till then.Thanks for reading, much love.","1"
"I know I'll probably sound like literally anyone else in crisis or anything like that but here.I plan to do it tomorrow. I don't know how but the plethora of ways is infinite and I can choose, so whatever. If you really need a tl;dr: Failing school, Autism, Parent hates me, I'm done.Here's the long one.I'm merely 15, which means I can't get a job where I live. I live in the number one crime state too, so that's also a thing going on. I'm only a sophomore in high school and I pretty much have 2 good friends, and a bunch of people who say they're my friends but they fail to realize I hate them. Most of them freshman or sophomores in my classes.It's almost the end of the grading period and I have passing grades and even some good ones, but one grade I have is making every adult I know hate me, and that's English.I know it's not an excuse but I'm one of the people with high high Autism, literally at the top of the spectrum. Meaning that being boxed in an English class with no freedom means bad news, and guess what class type my English is. Exactly.So that's school, but wait there's more. I have an IEP program, look it up if you don't know. This program screwed me more than it helped, in fact I don't think it helped me at all. It changed my perfect school schedule into something garbage, replacing an AP class with a special ed one. I am not a special ed student.A good grade I currently have is in Spanish but I was always good in Spanish, they changed my teacher for that class too. The teacher is nice but I miss the old one who contributed to my learning style.About the English class, it is an AP class in disguise of a normal one. The teacher is kind, but I look at other classes my grade and they're only half the way through the schedule I am in, and the teacher has very high standards. Everything in MLA(Which College doesn't even do as far as I've heard). She assigned a book report project to replace the final exam, but it was one of those reports where you say you have it in the beginning of the year and forget about it for the whole semester until ""Hey, where's that thing I never considered until now?"" Yeah it's one of those things and of course I forget about it because I have 7 classes total to get my shit together in and focusing on one means the rest are bad, tough luck. So that was school, let's get on to parents...My dad has full custody and my mom is missing. My dad is alright for a modern day dad, he's a teacher and I sometimes feel he likes me which is normal with my standards. Thing is he's also an adult who bombards me about English with no praise whatsoever about my other classes. He also never did dadlike things when I was a child. I don't know how to ride a bike, use money effectively, do things that you would expect a father to teach a child how to do and know for the rest of their lives. Not mine, mine came home from teaching and never interacted with anyone but my mom, which he divorced her for reasons unknown...My past is simple yet hard to talk about when talking to anyone but the internet because anonymity(yay). I had an abusive stepmom, mental abuse, punishing hard and believing I was addicted to technology, taking away my stuff for a whole freshman year, therefore killing any creativity I wanted to write on it...RIP.She's gone now, left us. I used to cut hardcore and my dad usually never notices, my brother does though but he doesn't do anything about it. 12 days after cutting I would get policed. Is there a way to talk about these things without getting caught by the police? Why don't they let me live in the pain I deserve.I'm convinced I don't deserve anything due to this fucking grade. I want to destroy all my things then do it. Hopefully tomorrow. I honestly see no other way but just to end it all.Also my dad paid 400$ on a trip I'm going to with a club I'm going, but that was just the money to go there. I need 150$ spending money otherwise I'm there without food, enjoyment, or pretty much anything, I'm just there.About the clubs I'm practically a nobody. Nobody says my name or points at me, laughs with me, whatever you would expect anybody to do with a friend. I'm also in a gaming club which is practically the same thing. I'm considering joining a feminism club(not feminazi club, these people actually care.) because I'm MtF...hope it goes well I guess...if I stay alive long enough to go.","1"

"I've made an appointment with my doctor to discuss this, but I just don't feel strong enough to tell anyone else, so here I am.I've struggled with depression for a long time. For as long as I remember. A constant feeling of not being good enough. Paranoia. Tiredness, and the longing to be a hermit.I've been with my boyfriend for nearly six years now. He tells me every day that he loves me. That he can't imagine his world without me in it. i tell him that i love him, too. And I do. I love him so, so much and the thought of abandoning him here so suddenly makes my heart jump.But also, at the same time, I feel absolutely nothing.I was talking to my step-mother on the phone the other day, because i had found out a cyst had been found on my kidney. She had said ""DedicatedReckoner, I know your new pills are working, because otherwise you'd be freaking out.""And she's right. Besides the usual state of existential dread and despair of being alive, I was remaining relatively apathetic. It could easily be a harmless cyst. Or, it could be cancerous. My family history is littered with different cancers and diseases. Maybe it was me who pulled the kidney disease card.But it's just so easy to not worry about something that I have no control over. But i obsess over it. I can't stop thinking, because I can't stop wondering when it's going to be my turn. I don't think i'll live forever. My birth mother died when I was 4, she was 36, from cancer and my father died at 60 from Pancreatic.I digress.I've been feeling like i'm on the verge of a mental breakdown. I've been pushing it away and ignoring because i keep telling myself that something's got to give.And then my grandfather died last week, and I googled some more. There's no such thing as manic depressive disorder anymore, so I guess that wasn't it.Or maybe the 112mg of Effexor that i'm now taking is fucking with my brain. I don't know, and I've never felt this way before.But yesterday, that was scary. i felt almost manic at work. I was crying. A manager told me to leave, and I'm to get a sick note. I'm still not ready to leave my house today, so they'll have to get it when I go to the doctor on Tuesday. I came home. I took two Ativan, smoked a little weed, and passed out. I was in and out, apparently, because I wrote that note. I said that I tried, but I couldn't try anymore. That this was it.I have a habit of writing things beforehand so I don't have to deal with it later. When my father was ill, i had his obituary ready 3 months before he passed. Is this me unconsciously preparing for me to off myself? I just don't know what to do. I'm scared to talk to someone about this in person because i feel like it's not going to amount to anything. That i'm not going to amount to anything.But that's all I've got, and thanks for listening.","1"

I have things I should be happy to have yet I'm a miserable insufferable asshole to be around. I have a loving girlfriend I treat like shit, I'm rude to most of my friends and family, I have no drive to do anything other than sit in my computer chair and waste away. I'm sure people would be like ""oh no don't kill yourself you're only 19 you have so much ahead of you"" but do I really have anything ahead of me? I'm a fuckin' waste of space, a degenerate. I don't even have the drive to kill myself because I'm so terribly lazy. I don't want to work ever, I don't want to go to college ever, I have no goals set for myself and can't even be bothered to set any. Whenever I try to get help I just shut down whoever is trying to help me, so why even bother helping me? I'm wasting everyone's time because anyone who invests time into me is investing in void. Every day I hope I get cancer or something seriously bad that hospitalizes me so I don't have to do anything anymore. It's fucking selfish, and I realize that. The worst part is, I know that tons of people care about me and yet I want a pitiful passing in a hospital and for people to miss me or care about me while seeing me go. I literally already have those things, and yet I'm selfish enough to want to remove myself from their lives for pity. I feel like I won't accomplish anything of any merit to myself or others in my life time. I've been living in a rut for over like 7 years fuck I don't even know how long. I've been miserable ever since I got into middle school which sounds childish and stupid to me so I can't even imagine how it sounds to someone else. I feel like I waste everyone's time when I'm with people, I feel like all the things the girlfriend I love does for me amount to nothing.

I'm no longer at risk, I'm in a stable, loving relationship, and I have a decent job that doesn't require me to overwork myself.Even so... I still fantasize about killing myself on bad days.I know I wouldn't do it, if only because I know how difficult that would be for my family. My PTSD support animal, an older special needs cat, would almost certainly be euthanized if I went through with it, and if she wasn't euthanized by some random miracle, she'd probably follow me into the grave. (She doesn't eat when I leave for long periods of time.) My biological daughter would have to live with my decision, and with the knowledge that a lot of this is probably being caused by postpartum depression; that's not the kind of legacy I want to give her. I have precious little else to offer, but I at least want her to know that she isn't to blame for my pain.Even so, I actively fantasize about death on the days when my anxiety doesn't seem to have an end. I need support, and I don't know where to get it because I don't have many friends (in part because I had a minor breakdown shortly before I had brain surgery, and I'm still sorting through it).

"Ok, so I'm 18 years old college freshman and I have suicidal thoughts every day now, very often. Ok I don't have any friends in college. I am not interested in the whole party scene and the only clubs that actually have any people in them are either academic clubs or religious clubs. I go back and forth with religion but I don't know if I can handle the type of ppl in those clubs. And I can't really make friends in class cause it would disrupt the lecture and you usually sit next to a different person every day cause the classes are so big and I'm naturally reserved person.But i and many ppl usually think of suicidal people as pill poppers, you know long hair skinny, mentally ill kids that still live with their moms and they do drugs and they have bad relationships. But this can happen to anyone I guess it's happening to me even tho I've never done any drugs or even drank alcohol before. Also I exercise every day, I try to eat healthy, I meditate, I don't play video games and read sometimes I try to build good habits and healthy lifestyle but nothing replaces friends and social interaction which I have none of. But after my classes and after the gym all I can do is lay in my dorm and do nothing. Sometimes I stay outside where all the ppl are walking but nobody will ever start a conversation with me and when I try to start conversations they usually last for like 10 seconds. Yes I've thought about suicide because I realize nobody would care or even notice I was gone. My mom would be devastated, and my brother and dad would be sad but I never see those people anyways. Where should I go from here? I'm definitely not telling my mom, she would think I'm mentally ill and I can assure you I'm definitely not. I also don't feel like telling a school counselor, I just want to talk to someone normal. Also I think it's hard for 18 yr olds to buy firearms and that's my preferred method. I can drink a huge load of laundry detergent or something like that but nah. I understand suicidal thoughts and actually taking action are 2 separate things but every day it gets just a little bit closer to the taking action part as I realize nobody cares ","1"

I don't want them to find it before I kill myself though, which is difficult. because I am an impulsive person and I don't know exactly when I'm going to do it, just that it is definately happening soon.

"Hey, i'm Alex. Felt like i should introduce myself i guess. I've had depression for a few years now, diagnosed anyway. Flirted with suicidal thoughts before, but always had one thought to ground me down, i wouldn't hurt my mother like that. She doesn't understand much about mental illness, but she tries her best to be there when i'm receptive. These days it doesn't feel like it's enough. I'm so tired. So alone. I have friends, i guess. I don't call them friends in my head, but they are people i hang around. Go to a party with at times, do group projects in my classes (in cegep, like q Quebec pre-university thing). I started a new medication, effexor, for anxiety. It helps with social interactions, but that's all it does so far. I'm trying to lose weight, and succeeding so far, but not healthily. I can't help myself. If i barely eat, my weight goes down. Quickly. If one of my organs fails, i'll just go, oops.I guess i was closer to one person. Was as in she can't really do anything now. She's been in a coma for two weeks now. Doctors say that only close family can get to visit. Didn't even think i cared that much for her, but i realised she was the only person who made me feel like i'm not alone. Even those nights when i just wanted her to care more, she still was there, and it helped, even if not directly. She just was amazing. I lost hope that she'll wake up by now.I'm so tired. Of school, of work, of trying to interact with people, of keeping the faade, of holding on. I just want to down by effexor pills and maybe some other to make sure it fries my liver. I just want to go, i'm so tired. I'm just scared that i will fail and wake up after. Even more ashamed. I'm tired of ""being so strong for holding on"". Of ""doing the right thing"".

At the same time, I fantasized about medication being the magical cure-all for my diseased mind. It hasnt been. In fact, I never even considered suicide before I started medication.I know how Im going to do it. Im going to get it right the first time. That way no one can stop me or god forbid pity me.

"My life has always been empty. Even when I was just 11, I knew that I did not have the right stuff for this world. I am alone. The more I think about who I am and my life as a whole, the more I want to kill myself. I have no energy left for anything else. No matter what I fucking do I am ashamed of myself either because of how I've gotten to where I am, or because what I'm doing is essentially a waste of time and a drain on resources. I don't plan on helping other people or contributing to society. I don't plan on making a life for myself. I don't plan on making myself better. I am shit. It's all my fucking fault too. I'm pathetic. Just plain pathetic. I will always hate myself. I have absolutely nothing to look forward to except heaven. That's my one saving grace. Maybe if I die, I'll get to go to heaven and the fact that I never forgot about my relationship with Christ will finally pay off. I used to think that non-existence would be better than heaven, but maybe when I come home it won't matter what I think and feel about myself anymore. This is the only way I can accept being alive, living with myself and my past and who I am. This world...this world is pain. It's all my fault. I didn't know what this feeling was when I was 11 because I was (and continue to be) emotionally blunted and calloused. I learned from an early age that I am never who I think I am to other people. I was never the person I desperately wanted to be. I am forever detached from my self. I will only ever acknowledge how deep in a whole I am until I get another fucking emotional epiphany like I am now, where I really look at my life and who I am and find I'm utterly disgusted and dissapointed with who I am still. I hate myself, and I will have to dissociate if I am to go on like this, until again, the next epiphany comes and I realize I am utterly ashamed to be me. I am ashamed to hear my name spoken. It's always just another fucking reminder that this is me. This pathetic man is me. I'm not allowed to be anyone else. I have to live with my utter failure at life itself. Fuck I'm crying now.

My friends tell me Im the strongest person they know after everything Ive endured which when I look back at it and how I felt I think I was being over dramatic and childish. My career is shit Im in a dead end job, I live with my parents. I feel like Im a pathetic loser who will have nothing to show in life. Ive been going to therapy even though I cant afford it but its days like today when I know shes not working this weekend that I want to be with her or at least talk to her. Edit: TL;DR no one seems to give a shit about this ghost. ","1"

"I don't know what to do anymore. It's been 2 years since I've talked to anyone. I don't think I have the guts to actually kill myself but at the same time I feel like I need to. I've never had any real friends my entire life and the friends that I used to have are no longer close to me. I have grown distant from everyone and I have no way of connecting to people. My family has not spoken to me in a really long time and I don't have that one person i can talk to in my life and I don't see any way out of it. I just want one real life friend i can go out with or watch a movie with or just talk with. I live half way across the world from my family and I've been away since I was 16 (I know it's too young) to attend university. The culture in America is very different and I long for some company. I think that's the reason why I cannot connect to people. I have always been an introvert but I try to talk and make friends with people in my class but nobody wants to really hang out with me. They're just ""classmate friends"" you can say. College students are much older than me on average and there is no one my age that I can talk to or connect to. Chemical Engineering classes are filled with a bunch of people years older than me. I have finals in a few days and I think I'm going to end my life. I feel like people have looked past me because I'm ""smart"" but that doesn't mean anything I don't long for someone I can get along with... I'm sorry. ","1"

"Yep, Im really drunk but I made a conscious effort to remember to post on SuicideWatch and thank all of you whove given me guidance. Turns out I cant be saved. I feel sick and like Im going to pass out now. So I better get going. Thanks again.-Alice Update: Its about 24 hours exactly since I overdosed and slit my wrist and Im doing pretty alright. Im still waiting to be discharged while they run final tests and have still felt quite low.  But the heartfelt messages left in the comments have really made me feel a whole lot better, so thank you for those. In total I took a cocktail of about 150-200 pills, types of antidepressants, lots of painkillers, even I think a few antibiotics lmao. I spent the night in A&E hooked up to drips and getting blood tests and threw up about the equivalent of my body weight. But Im feeling I lot better physically now, just very tired and will probably have some pretty grim scarring on my arm. I do almost feel relieved that Im alive though which is hopeful. Thank you for caring-","1"
"For the past few years Ive been living without a sense of purpose.Every day I wake up wishing I was dead. Ive disappointed my parents countless of times, wasted their time and money. Made horrible mistakes, and probably just ruined my future, if I even had one to begin with.Would it be called ""living"" if I have no purpose in life? Am I better off dead? I feel like for once in my life Id be doing my family a favor if I killed myself.The thought of whatever may come my way frightens me. This isnt how I thought things would go.Im sure Ill disappoint my parents again today, and Im afraid that will be my breaking point.","1"
"It's over. My suicide note is done. Tonight, I'll be free. Free from emotion, free from the self hatred. Free from everything. I'm almost done with my will. My brain is trying one last time to survive. Look for help one more time. Please. That's what it says.On August 16th I felt the first stroke of pain. I was born coddled. School was no issue. But then I went there. To the STEMM Academy. By September 13th, I had my first thought of death. I kept hidden. When I told my parents about my feelings, they told me the same old thing, ""Suicide is a permanent solution for a temporary problem."" My problem didn't go away. Then, I got really irritated when my teacher might as well spit in my face. She told the whole class that teen suicide was caused by them thinking the little things are big. But now, it makes sense. I give up. I've been fighting this war too long. I've left STEMM, but the echos of pain still ruin me.Please help me. In truth, I don't want to die, all I ever want is for the pain to end.I'm weak, and I know it. I'm a coward. I've given it my all to survive. But I no longer have my old strength and support","1"
"So I think my suicidal ideation is becoming more and more detailed, to where I've formed some sort of plan...The thing is, I know what I'm going to do is extremely unlikely to kill me. In fact, I think I'd even leave the bathroom door unlocked. I'm afraid of taking that last step. I know if I did it (abuse medication) it'd just create so many more problems for me because I'd get it taken away.So some might say if I was attempting suicide it'd be a cry for help. But I don't think it is, because I'm already getting help and people are taking me seriously and all that.I can't figure out why I feel this way. Is it just attention seeking so I can say that this is something I've done? Normally you'd do that so people take you seriously. Perhaps in real life they do, but maybe not the mental health services.","1"
"I was done with everything. I knew I had responsibilities the next day and was expected to be there. I didn't care. Around 2:15am I took 26 of my sleeping pills. It was weird. When I started to feel it, I decided to smoke weed just to help calm me down. I for some reason thought to clean my pipe, I don't remember if I actually did up smoking but I did a really good job at cleaning it. I remember feeling loopy and I remember puking a lot. I apparently took photos of myself and I looked very messed up. The rest of it I don't remember at all. I thought for sure I was gone, but what actually happened I was asleep for two days straight. No one checked on me, only to assume I flaked. I was mad when I woke up. I woke up to a lot of missed phone calls and texts. Everyone was and still is mad at me for not showing up. No one knows what I tried to do. My body still seems to be in bad shape but I don't know if I want to go and get it checked out. I failed and people don't need to know. My friends and family are mad at me, but they have no idea. I'm out of pills, so I may wait until my next refill and try again. I hope 30 pills will do it.  I hate this feelingI hate myself and feel like such a failure. I don't deserve to be here. ","1"
"Not /r/SuicideWatch, not a therapist, not my family. In the end people who pushed through this bullshit are the ones, who had to fend for themselves. They were strong or lucky enough to see past the dark clouds and thought to themselves ""Maybe there is something worth in the end"".I can blame depression or other countless mental illnesses, but it still doesn't change the fact that I have to choose to go to therapist, try to get help and decide to take some pills that are supposed to make me feel better. Yet I don't.There is no magic way of fixing this. I just realized that and it only makes me depressed more. I wish someone could take the load off my shoulders, but no one can do it for me, sadly.I'm still fucking stubborn and refuse to do anything about my situation. All I want is to sit in my room and watch cartoons and play video games and I'm still pretending like I'm in high school.I wish I had my carefree childhood back. I wish I was in middle school again, coming back home, sitting in front of PC all day and not worrying about anything but studying for exams and having average grades. I was the happiest motherfucker when I didn't give a shit and didn't have to work.Ever since I've gone into university and dropped out, things have become worse. Last year I couldn't spend a week without me having a mental breakdown and crying because I missed my parents. I didn't give a shit about my homework and assignments, never read the books and in the end, I left university with debt. One year later and I'm still in the same dark place.God, please.

"I'm at the end of the line. I've attempted suicide numerous times in my teenage years by overdosing on prescription psych meds but I stopped taking them years ago because they did nothing but hurt me more. I still have quite a bit left over (various brands) but after researching online, none of them will kill me in the quantities I have. I would just be left in a coma or have permanent organ damage. I just want to die in peace. One final moment of peace is all I want before I embrace eternity. So I started thinking about other ways to do it.I don't have firearms, and even if I did, I'd be too scared of flinching or backing out due to the horrible risk of surviving mutilated.I don't know how/where to get fentanyl, but the idea of my mother finding my bloated body, frothing at the mouth, isn't appealing either.I settled on starvation because it's easily accessible plus the thought of food makes me nauseated, and I actually got several days in before learning that it's one of the most painful and least dignified ways out there.I can't do anything right, including suicide. I don't want to be alive anymore because life is just neverending moments of disappointment and pain. I need to die. I told myself I'd wait until my parents died but I just can't. ...being asked to prolong my suffering just for their comfort is too much. I just want my departure to be as easy as possible on them, and on me.","1"

"I'm getting so close to snapping. I don't have anyone in my life, I'm distant from my entire family, and it feels like everyone would prefer it if I was dead. My family hates me and so does everyone else. The loneliness is so utterly painful. I have nobody to talk to about anything so I just do it all online anonymously. I post so much on reddit that it makes me feel pathetic. I've lived so many years of my life full of myself but I'm starting to come off my high horse and I'm coming off of it hard. Nothing interests me and it seems like I just do things cause that's what I gotta do. I really don't want to have to work for the rest of my life. The thought of that sucks so much. I'm so afraid of everyone. My social anxiety is debilitating. I hate being in a room because it feels like everyone is glaring at me and judging me. I over think everything in general and my anxiety gets so intense I have to fight it away with distractions and this keeps me from working or doing anything else. I'm a maladaptive daydreamer and I've spent years just laying in my bed and dreaming. This is not an exaggeration. I haven't done so many things and I've just daydreamed them instead. So pathetic. I could never build another connection with a human being. I will never feel close to another human being. They're so distant from me and I bring everyone down. It's like I'm on the outside of the world looking in. I'm so fucking lonely, guys. So, so lonely. I did horrible in school starting in eighth grade. Just sat in my room and never did work. Never even got a job or did volunteer service or hung out with friends once (it's been a good 8 years or so of this now) because I don't have friends. I have nobody on this earth goddammit I am so alone I just submitted mediocre college apps because I'm such a loser pos and I'll probably end up working a dead end job I hate just like everyone else in my whole family and fuck I hate the thought of that so much I don't want to work a horrible miserable job for the rest of my life. I don't want to go to community college. I want out of this fucking city. I want to run away and start completely over. I want to be a completely and totally different human being. I don't want to be me anymore. I was addicted to video games for so many years and lost so many experiences to themThere are guns in my house and I think I might kill myself this weekend. If I can't find the guns I'm going to go out and buy the strongest sleeping pills I can and the sturdiest rope I can and I'll do it that way. I'm done. I'm a fucking poison on this earth and I'm fucking done. I'm gonna stop now. Can't read my screen through these tears and I'm starting to shake my problems are infantile and stupid and I'm a whiny needy entitled bitch. why do I even bother posting here this stuff never helps.

"I've read a bit online about pill O.D and the general consensus that I've seen is that many people say overdosing on pills is extremely painful and may not even cause fatality. I would appreciate it if anyone could tell me if: I have an ""all-nighter"" so that I'm extremely tired, then the next day I force myself to keep awake throughout the day, then in the evening I down some alcohol to make me even more tired/lethargic followed by swallowing a box of 30 ""10mg Eglonyl"" pills and 10 ""10mg Urbonol"" pills with 10 ""30mg lilyfluoxetine"" pills.

"Where do I start? I failed my last organic chemistry test and I got ill with bronchitis mid semester so I was bedridden for weeks and Im so behind in my classes but this fun little demon called Major Depression has robbed me of the motivation to even do my work. I cant even fucking... showering feels like a chore. I cant concentrate on anything. Im lightheaded constantly. Ive sat in the library for the past 3 hours and have read one paragraph. Am I retarded. I have generalized anxiety so I have like, at least one panic attack a day and constantly worry about dumb shit like swallowing my tongue, crapping my pants, breathing too fast, too slow. My heart is racing right now and I wont stop feeling like Im going to faint. I dont want to feel like this all the time anymore and Ive given up. Im rotting away from the inside out, I cant have fun anymore, going out with friends doesnt bring me joy and I feel like a burden, and I went through a pretty rough breakup w my best friend recently.... she said nasty things about me that confirmed how I see myself, behind my back all while pretending to be my friend. She called me so ugly that even a plastic surgeon cant fix me, a nuisance, unlovable, unnatractive, and its true. Im fucking hideous and I keep binge eating and now my stomach sticks out more than my boobs and I feel awful after every binge. She was right and I hate the awful truth. My biggest fear is that someone would see me how I saw myself and it came true. Today she messaged my roommate trying to go out and it reminded me that somebody else sees me the way I see myself and i Just cant take that anymore. My friends would be better off without an ugly idiot like me ruining their pictures, annoying them and ruining their quality of life, and the only reason I havent killed myself is because Im too lazy and dont want to be humiliated if I wake up. Ive written my note multiple times. I hurt myself and hit my head on things just to feel something physical since Im agitated, my mind races. Im contemplating taking a running leap off the penn state library roof, so if you see any news it was me. Im a complete failure and its finals week soon and i have 13 more days until break but if I fail Ill hate myself because I could have just done a medical withdrawal feom my illness and at this point I dont see how things can get better. I guess I want the pain to stop more than I want to actually be dead, but how else will it? If I die, I will be at peace which I havent for four months.","1"
"I tried to carve into my legs but we have horrendously dull knives. When I was younger I used to just slowly scratch away my skin with my finger nails until I bled. I think Im incapable of genuinely feeling happy. Ive been suicidal and self harming since I was 7. Im now 22. Ive been hospitalized 4 times. Ive been on every available antidepressant. Ive been abused. Ive been raped. My life is much better than it used to be but I still feel like I want to die. I feel like I dont deserve this good life because of what happened to me , the bad things Ive done, and my apparent inability to appreciate it. Any kind of high stress situation now makes me want to end my life. I cant sleep without vivid nightmares of sexual assault.  I dont want to go back to the hospital. The last couple times it didnt even help. Its been 15 years of feeling this way and I dont feel like Ive made any progress sometimes. Whats even the point anymore? There isnt even anything about me that this world needs or could somehow benefit from. I feel like a waste of space, resources, and time.

"I tried posting this on /r/relationships, but they told me to post it here. I hope that's okay. If this doesn't fit the mods can remove it. This is the post.My boyfriend and I have been in a long distance relationship for about a year and a half. We met online when we were both in a really bad mental state. He was the first man I ever truly loved, he's my best friend, and this is the longest relationship either of us have been in.For reasons I don't entirely understand, I'm not happy as his romantic partner. I worry I jumped the gun on a relationship when I really just wanted a friend. No matter how hard I try, I just can't be content with how things are. I care about my boyfriend still. I care about him so much. I just don't want to be his girlfriend anymore. Ideally, I'd want to remain his best friend and he my best friend. But my past experience with relationships tells me that probably wont happen.Over the past year and a half our relationship has become extremely codependent. We're in nearly constant contact and neither of us have a particularly large circle of friends outside of each other. I've tried addressing this with him in the past, but he doesn't see a problem with how close we are. How we're basically each others only friends. I've been trying to widen my circle of friends lately, and I'm encouraging him to do the same, but he doesn't have much interest.He's an incredibly sweet guy. Someone I know will find other girls to be with. But he has very little self esteem and doesn't get out much. There was a point in our relationship where anxiety and depression really hit him hard. I did all I could to be there for him, support him, help him get through the battle he was fighting, and luckily he did. Over the course of a few months he was back to his normal self. I worry a lot about what would have happened if I wasnt there for him those few months. He has a history with depression and he hasn't really developed the ability to talk with people about it. It's a rough situation, because when he's feeling good, he doesn't feel the need to have a support network, but when he's feeling bad, he doesn't have the motivation to get help. He's a great guy, but incredibly stubborn. Basically since we met I've been trying to convince him to see a therapist, have one on standby in case he gets bad, or at least talk with his family about therapy. But I can't get him to budge or do anything and I don't know what to do to help him.There was a point in our relationship where we did break up. For about a month. I hate to say it, but I was happier during that month than the last several of our relationship. But my boyfriend was miserable. I don't want to go over all the details, but my breaking up with him and the sadness from it consumed his life. He talked multiple times about self harm and suicide. There were a handful of nights where I was really worried he'd try something and it terrified me. I was scared he'd hurt himself and I'd lose my best friend forever. This fear and some loneliness of my own drove me to get back together with him. I know that was a bad decision. That it was stupid and undid any progress I'd made, but I was just so scared he'd hurt himself. I tried to encourage him to see a therapist, and when he got bad, check himself into a hospital, but he'd never listen. I really didn't have any control over the situation. It was the only thing I could do.I don't know what to do with our relationship or my life now. I fucked up and I'm too scared of losing my best friend to even begin to fix it. Please, I need help.TL;DR: I don't want to be in a relationship with my BF anymore, but I have reason to worry he'll hurt or kill himself if we break up and I don't know how to help him.Thank you for reading this.

"I have some things that I really do genuinely enjoy I've found, and that's making me feel all the worse about this inevitability of me ending my life, there's really no stopping it now. All I can do now is sit around and feel terrible thinking about what might have been had I done some things a little bit differently while I wait for the day of my death. It just feels so fucking bad man, I'm so fucking helpless and there's nothing I can do to stop any of this, it's just all out of my fucking control completely. Not that any of it really matters at this point anyways, I've accepted the fact that I was going to die a long time ago and I'm more ready for it than ever. Killing myself really does seem like the most fitting end for me all things considered, but it still just feels so bad, everything just feels so bad.

"Sometimes I feel like such a loser. I don't have a job and I don't want one right now. I just don't feel ready for that yet. I just sit in my room mostly. I also have a hard time getting motivated sometimes even to just take a shower and get ready in the morning. I don't have a girlfriend either and no girl is gonna want to be with a loser like me.

But there's just too much that I'm dealing with right now and sometimes I just wake up feeling like such a loser that I should just get rid of myself. I'm probably a big disappointment to everybody. Plus no girl will probably like me anyways because I'll probably be too boring for them and on top of that I'm a loser with no job and on top of that I have no experience in bed cause I'm still a virgin. Which bothers me everyday cause I have these urges and at this point they're driving me crazy.","1"
"It is very hard to explain how I feel like. The more I think about it, the more it hurts. It feels like a narrow dark space with no air inside. And it hurts. It hurts when I go to bed. It hurts when I wake up in the morning. It hurts when I am at work. It hurts when I enjoy the lake near my apartment. And it is not my body that hurts. It is not my soul because I do not believe in such thing. But somewhere deep inside my head, my skull, my brain. Mentality? So, I want to commit suicide. The reason for such a weird desire of mine isn't my laziness or my 'I hate the world' attitude. I just suffer from the constant pain of being guilty. Even right now you can't even imagine how guilty I feel because of writing this down. People tell me I'm lazy. People tell me I would look better if I lose some pounds. People tell me to watch my mouth and get rid of my accent. I am tired of ignorance from others. I don't want to hear your ""I am sorry"" or ""I/my parent/my brother or sister/my friend has the same problem and they probably had it worse"". I don't want that. I want love. I want appreciation. I want people to recognize me. I want to be loved. I want to be perfect for everybody. I want to stop feeling guilty. And with all of this white noise originating from people's mouths, I can't hear myself and I can't hear my desire to live anymore. I'm not happy. I'm upset everyday, doesn't matter what happens. My desire to live a full life, my happiness, my joy, my MEANING OF EVERYTHING ALREADY COMMITTED SUICIDE YEARS AGO WHEN I STARTED FEELING AND LIVING WITH THIS AGONY IN MY HEAD AND MY BODY. I CANNOT TAKE IT ANYMORE. I CANNOT DO THIS ANYMORE. I DO NOT CARE ANYMORE. I AM DONE. I AM SO DONE OF TRYING in this life. Maybe another life gives me something good. However, I hope, there is nothing behind the bloody door which I'm going to open soon. Very soon. But you better be smiling more, sunshine. Right? I smile. Or do I? It's more of a fake smile. I heard people saying that if you do fake smile it will actually make you happy. Doesn't seem like it. No matter how hard I try it's just a short term solution, which doesn't make me feel any better. I still look for something inside myself. I still look for some parts of me that are functioning wrongly because it is my fault and I am the one to blame. I am not good enough. I am not trying hard enough. I am way to lazy. I am the one to talk. I surrounded myself with sand castles which are my dreams and hopes and there is a tide and a wind that are going to destroy everything I built. All of this makes me feel like I am unworthy. I mean, I know I am unworthy. What did I do wrong? Where am I going? Everything and nowhere.","1"
"I'm on my phone now but just yesterday i made a post in the anxiety subreddit about my brother. Turns out things were a lot worse than we thought. I was with my mom in the living room when he called out saying he needed to go to the hospital. We thought his anxiety was kicking up and he was stressing over some things. My dad went to go check on him and next thing I know we was all scrambling. The ambulance and police came. My mom and dad went with him while I stayed with my brother who has a disability. They left the knife here and there is blood all in the sink. I dont know if i should clean the sink or even if I am able to do that. I certainly dont want my parents to do so and i am just so lost. I know reading this sounds crazy but I need some outlet. I haven't had proper sleep in about three days and I don't know if I will after this. My anxiety is through the roof but I feel like I have to be strong for everyone else.Update: Got a call back from the dispatch saying they are coming back to pick up the knife. All of my family is aware of what is happening. I just feel really helpless and I can only imagine how my parents feel. I told my bother to use the other bathroom. I don't know whether im ready but someone has to do it.Update: Got another call back saying they didn't need the knife and to throw it away.","1"
"Im ugly, friendless, will never get married or have my own family. Im stupid, Im losing my career because Im crazy. I was given real bad genetics, its why Im on this sub and how I became this way. It seems the world tells you who you are suppose to be, by what genetics you are given. I dont know what the point is to stay around anymore. I gave it a good shot and my dreams were destroyed, Ive lost everything I have accomplished, I lost my career in the military, my security clearance, my pilots license, every girl I tried to date. I only feel obligated to stay around cause my family will be sad. But its getting hard to do that anymore. Its weird I feel less and less connected to my family as time goes on, I think it is because I hate myself so much I cant imagine them wanting to be associated with me. I wish they just hated me so I could end it without guilt. Guilt and obligation is the only thing keeping me alive and Im scared of going to hell. Im miserable. I dont feel like trying anymore. I have to start over with a new career. But for what? Just to keep myself alive longer to zombie through a life I hate? I dont see the point to it. Everything has been robbed from me and I have nothing left inside me. No motivation, no dreams, no passion. I wish I never been born. I keep fantasising about taking a trip to San Francisco, having one last night on the town, get drunk beyond belief and then plummet off the bridge. I will leave my keys in my car with the door open for someone to take. I would write one last text to my family saying Im sorry, I love them, its not there fault and then throw my phone over and jump. ","1"

"Every time I go to therapy, my therapist always points out the people who have struggled with so much worse and gotten through it. According to her, I have ""spoiled kid syndrome"" and I take my life for granted. And you know what? I do. I had everything fucking handed to me on a goddamn silver platter and I threw it all away. I made myself worse. I dwelled on everything and are almost comfortable being this fucked. Know why? Because its easier. Ive been nothing but a lazy sack of shit my entire life, ruining everything and throwing every chance at a good life away. And for some reason, I dont even care. My therapist asks me all the time what I want in life. I never say anything. How can I say all I want is to die? I've never wanted to live my life, I don't want to constantly live with the despicable human being I am. Everything thats gone wrong in my fucking life is my own damn fault. I don't try to change, I don't make an effort. I dont want to help this scum. I never deserved anything I had and still don't. I've wasted everyones time, resources, money, caring... I've never deserved happiness because I refuse to work for it. I can't fucking wait til I'm finally dead. My family will be upset but yknow, I wont have to spend another second with myself, and thats all I fucking want.","1"

"Ive been suicidally depressed for eight years now. I tried once, seven years ago, and seeing what my parents had to go through after that whole ordeal, I vowed to myself and to them that Id never do anything like that again. I am not living for myself. The only reason I am still alive is because I cannot in good conscience do that to my parents. Once they both pass away though, I am for sure gone. I know I have a couple friends and family members who would be hurt as well by my suicide, but despite knowing that it would likely be scarring and traumatic for them, my internal justification is that at least it isnt as bad as a parent losing a child. To put it bluntly (and make me sound like an asshole), I can live with hurting friends and extended family via death if it means I can finally stop suffering. Okay, maybe I can live with is a poor choice of words. However, even though I still obviously do not want to put my parents through the hell that is their child committing suicide, I can feel myself getting weaker. Things keep getting worse, I am getting exhausted from feeling like shit all the fucking time, and it is becoming unbearable. I have no friends that I could comfortably reach out to and talk to, I sure as hell dont want to talk to my parents, and my therapist is practically MIA since I cant ever see her anymore with the long hours Ive been working. Havent seen my therapist in a couple months, which, coming from weekly visits, is certainly not doing me any favors. I dont really know why Im posting here. Maybe just to vent some more because I dont have anyone to actually vent to. All I know is I am fucking miserable, want to die, and am getting closer to fully justifying my premature death. The pain I am constantly in is close to being stronger than the desire I have to not hurt my parents in that way, if that makes any sense. I feel so alone. So tired. So fucking hopeless and sick of everything. The good times have never been worth all the bad, so that certainly isnt enough to keep me going either. I so genuinely wish that I could die not by my hand. A freak accident, a health issue, anything that could kill me and I wouldnt be responsible. Its kind of sick really - my desire to not hurt my parents isnt really empathy at all. Its just guilt. Guilt that I would be at fault for causing them that pain. If they were pained by a death that was out of my control, that for some reason is good enough. Good god Im a terrible human being. I do nearly everything in my power to try to help myself, and nothing ever works. Please just let me die. Anything, anyone, please...all I want is for it all to be over. ","1"
"Im 21, i can relate to the loneliness you feel. It itches in the back of your head as you try to sleep and when you wake up. Ive had the endless black void of suicide call out to me as well, it seems like it exists somewhere in space. When you entertain it you get that feeling in your chest of pure agony that isnt even close to when you break down in tears. You have to fucking battle that shit every moment because stuff is coming up in your life where youll be glad you didnt end it. Ive tried to imagine my parent, brother, or friend having to break into my apartment and find my body hanging completely still. Most likely theyll get that hollow feeling youve felt so often. You wouldnt want to do that to them right?","1"

I'm a 16 year old male, I have a good body, straight A's, plenty of ""friends"", and a void that has been occupying my attention for a little over 3 months. Every day is the same thing, and endless cycle of monotony, I've built a character for myself that's always happy and every day I have to act out his person so others are happy. I'm not myself, I can't be an individual. I feel trapped as even my parents love this character I made, let's call it ""John"".  My mom has been spending more time on the phone than interacting with us. I don't know... I probably haven't done a good job of describing it so I'll condense it all into one point.  I'm tired of living the same happy go lucky lie, and tired of not being appreciated, so I'm contemplating ending it. I have made plans before and even gone so far as to open the case of my dads rifle. The only reason I haven't offed myself is because  of fear.","1"

If they start talking to me in a condescending way or talk down to me in any way I'm gonna start yelling and if they start yelling back I'm gonna get even more angry. I don't like feeling like anyones bitch. Everyone just thinks they can treat me as inferior to them. They think there fucking better than me? This is what I keep imagining in my head all the time and then I get really angry and I imagine hurting them and then hurting myself. We'll see how they like it when I make them feel powerless and inferior. I'll make them feel sorry and make them regret treating me this way. Then maybe I'll kill myself right in front of them. Then we'll see what they have to say. I'm so fucking pissed. This is what I keep imagining in my head and that's what makes me angry. People piss me off. They deserve to die.

"Welp. Im not really sure where to begin.I am a 30 year old living in America. I grew up on the coast. I still have both my parents although theyve never been together. My brother and I do not speak often or candidly. 4 years ago I left everyone and everything I knew for a job I knew I didnt want.Running didnt help. Im more boring now than I ever have been. I was popular in high school and made strong connections in college. I fucked up my studies thoroughly and never finished. Havent spoken to a single person from college since.Ive never had sex. Ive only looked at porn a few times and it made me anxious. I do occasionally masturbate but I have a unique fetish that is harmless but brutally embarrassing. I have no idea how I got it. Been this way since puberty. Not well-endowed either so I have never even tried to get laid and try to make it work.On top of this, I have a body Ive ruined through extremely rapid weight gain and intense alcohol abuse. I was very handsome even just a few years ago, its crazy how things can spiral.Lying here in my bed, going on 6 months of therapy, and my 3rd day sober, my biggest streak in many years. All I can think about is how much Ive wasted and how lost I am. I dont mean to spin a sob story, but Ive said more here than I have in therapy. I dont feel like I will ever catch up to the rest of you all and I doubt I will make it to 40. I think something must have happened to me when I was young or maybe I was born with crossed wires.

"I dont really know what Im posting this for but I guess I want to hear some people sympathize or something.I remember thinking a lot more logically than I wouldve expected, and for once I finally knew exactly where my belt was funnily enough. I walked into my restroom where the shower door has this sturdy metal rack thing I thought would be perfect. I managed to find instructions on the first page of results which I think is kind of ridiculous. I was surprised to find that cutting off blood flow to the carotid artery was a lot more efficient and painless than restricting oxygen flow. I tied a simple knot with the top of the belt and looped it through in such a way that when pressure was applied from the inside of the loop, it would tighten. My psychologist parents used to tell me all the time how smart they knew I was, and I was finally putting it to use. But apparently slight reserved ness is psychosis in the eyes of my mother, someone with a PhD in psychology. Gaslighting through and through. These were the things I thought about as I quietly stood with my head in the loop. I finally decided release my weight and fall but in the two hours I was standing there the knot had loosened, causing the belt to slip of the rack when I let loose.I cursed about it but lacked the motivation to actually re tie it.Jesus Christ in these past few days I feel like Ive been losing it. Forgetting where I was momentarily. Giving myself bloody noses and allowing it run down the sink.

"Never thought I would end up here, I am 21 year old virgin loser male. Never had gf and whose family doesn't even love him unconditionally. The thing is I come from a Muslim household, although i'm not a relgious person myself, infact I would say I am the complete opposite. I fucking despise Islam and thinks it is one of the worst ideologues on the planet. However I have to pretend like I am fucking muslim to my family otherwise they would sever all ties with me and kick me out of the house. Even as I am pretending to be a religious person infront of them, our relationship with each other is still pretty bad. For instance all we do is argue and never really interact like a normal functioning family. For me personally it is kind of soul crushing how I dont feel any true connection to my family and I have never really had a gf, it sort of makes me feel a little bit unwanted. I usually dont talk about these things however I just wanted an outlet to finally speak out. I know these issues are really petty compared to alot of other peoples problems, but I have been constantly beating up myself with these thoughts for the last 3 years and I just thought enough is enough.","1"

Biggest mistake of my fucking life I was so close to graduating.. now I got lucky and got accepted to a community college that has a program where u get ur hs degree and an associates at the same time!!

"Okay, premise. 18, gay, autistic, Pagan. I had an abusive father for the first 9 years of my life until he tried to kill my mother and the rest of us. Since then, I don't think I've ever been truly happy. There's always been something to worry about. My mother never made more than $15,000 a year, which is half of the poverty line to support herself and 4 kids. I've never had any friends, and without that money I don't really have any way to spend my time. I go to a special needs school where the staff actively bully and humiliate the kids. I get the worst end of it because they know I'm smart enough to understand what they say, and it impacts me more. I need to take an extra semester due to what I now know to be a giant scheme to farm funding by faking lost credits on standardized testing. I'm fast running out of resources that are willing to help me. I only have my therapist left, and to get to her I have to go through the school and I just can't do it anymore. The only true reason I have to live is my cat, and that statement itself is so pathetic it's pushing me further. Family disowns me for being gay. No place to go that's safe. People stop me on the street and threaten me for wearing my pentacle necklace. I don't feel safe anymore. I want to die by my own hands before I get stabbed by some radical Christian. ","1"
"I don't trust anyone. I mean that very literally. At 27 years old I'm just about completely alone in this world.  I have severe abandonment related PTSD and I am absolutely fucked up like you couldn't imagine. I literally cannot build even the most casual relationship with anyone. I can barely hold a conversation, either professional or casual, without panicking. Usually I just act really mean and say things people don't like so they won't want to try and get close to me (this is completely subconscious. I'm aware of it based purely on recollection). It's an extremely depressive, isolated, and unhealthy existence and I CAN'T MAKE IT STOP.  I'm seeing a university psychologist who recently told me that I actually want to be sick... that broke the tiny bit of trust I've been developing with her over the course of the past 6 weeks. I'm not going back to see her. I knew this would happen anyway. My grandfather told me the same thing when I was a kid... ""You want to be sad. You want to be angry. You want to be discontent.""  This is going to make me sound like I'm exaggerating, but I'm truly not: literally every person that I've ever loved or grown to trust has betrayed or abandoned me. My mother and father are addicts. I never had a relationship with my mom, but my dad was constantly in and out of my life. That fucking shattered me as a child. I lived with my grandparents who made sure I knew their love was 100% conditional on my ability to live up to their fanatically religious expectations. I had a morbidly difficult childhood in which I constantly felt that at the slightest provocation or failure I would be left alone to die. The first time I thought about suicide I didn't even know what the word meant. ""Suicide"" had not yet entered my vocabulary. Suicide was an original and completely organic thought for me. I was 4 years old and I distinctly remember wanting to kill myself. I've always thought of tall buildings and cliffs, still to this day.  I won't go in depth into the slew of really intense friendships and relationships that I invested myself in throughout my life only to be disappointed. I will say that my grandparents sabotaged my relationship with my high school girlfriend who was without a doubt one of the closest relationships I've ever experienced. I'll say that I've been physically abused by women in multiple relationships. I accepted this because I often thought I deserved it and I was afraid to be alone. My last relationship I thought an angel had been sent by the god I don't believe in anymore. I can't even talk about what happened there. Let's just say she used me to get pregnant under the guise that we were getting married and building a family together (the family I never had). I was attending college (still am) and working almost full-time while maintaining straight A's. After she left I almost shot myself. 6 months later I graduated from college with honors and a 3.97 gpa. Somehow I decided not to kill myself in that moment with the pistol against my temple. I was angry at all of these people who I had really really loved with all my heart. These people who tricked me into giving over my soul... I put that gun down ALONE without a single person to help me. Here I am thinking about it again... this time I don't have a gun. This time I want to drink myself to death. It probably won't work.  My hard work and self-conviction isn't enough. I can't do this alone, but I don't have a choice but to be alone. People are the scariest thing to me. Every piece of pain I've experienced has come from people that I really trusted with all of my heart. I would have traded my fucking life for these people, and I meant nothing to them. This is what people do. They try to make you comfortable and trusting and vulnerable, then they take what they want from you and leave you alone to deal with the fallout. No matter what anyone says I'll never believe it again. I'll never believe it when someone says, ""I love you."" The truth is that you only love YOUR FUCKING SELF. People like me are the ones who die first at the hands of people who lie and cheat to pull what they want out of you. Fuck everything.","1"
"Everyone always says suicides a permanent solution for a temporary problem, but that's the thing isn't it it's not always temporary . I don't want pity I never have I just want to feel, be, get better etc. I've wanted to die since the age of... well for as long as I remember.  I've never had the balls I remember my first thought of suicide I grabbed my moms pistol from her drawer when she was out and put the barrel against my temple I tried to squeeze the trigger but my hands were to clammy to keep hold of the gun. That might have been the one time I could have done it, but now it's too fucking late I've become even more of a coward. So I subconsciously and very strategically eviscerated any chance of happiness I can't even talk to my fucking family without knowing how much it physically makes them sick to be around me. They always had high aspirations that I'd figure my shit out and be successful. Now I'm a highschool fuck up, in so much misery all I can feel is the will to die but I can't so I experiment with different drugs, alcohol, cutting, etc to drown out everything at first it works then the effects cease to be helpful you need more more more until it's so expensive it's pointless. I digress I'm sorry to rant I just have no one to talk to I know this reads like drug fueled nonsense but that's the onlyTime I can talk about shit I'll probably end up deleting this have a nice life if not ","1"

"It was the same girl too. Like, why the f are you volunteering at a crisis center if you're just going to hang up on people? ? I managed to find a local number to call, but it didn't help much. No one has any answers for me. I think about suicide a lot, I have a plan, I have the means, but when I have the intent, I absolutely won't reach out to anyone. I try to reach out before it gets to that point, but sometimes that doesn't help, I get to that place anyway, and it's just been luck that I've been interrupted by someone coming home early or something like that. It's like I'm a different person and the urge to stay alive is gone at that point. Likr I'm in my body but someone else is controlling it. But if I can't predict it, how do I stop myself? Because even when I don't have the intent to do it right away, the desire to live is not strong enough for me to put anything in place to stop myself when I get to that point. I saw my therapist today and she basically said she can't give me a reason to live and she can't force me to do anything I don't want to do. I know that. I guess my only option is to just do what I'm doing and hope things get better. And if not, well, I can say that I tried.","1"

"I don't have a history of depression or suicidal thinking. But here I am, for the first time in my life, really seriously thinking about it. Sure, I've had low moments that have brought fleeting thoughts of ""what if?"" but then I'd think of how much it would hurt the people I love, how someone would have to find my body, go through my things and wrap up my affairs.But tonight I'm so raw, so past all of the usual sensible logical mental blockades, those things I've previously paused to think or care about. Tonight I contemplate what's in the house that I could overdose on, or how else I could do it quickly and completely. How I could put an end to the nightmares and waking up in panic attacks, the inability to control my weeping outbursts on lunch breaks and quiet moments at work. How I could stop the bottomless pain of being abandoned by a partner I'd taken a job over and built a life around (supporting this person, no less) in a new place. Now I'm just alone in the middle of nowhere, without my prior life/support network/outlets to revert back to. Alone and feeling like I wasn't enough for them, wasn't enough to be worth the work of resolving their own issues to have the life we dreamt of, planned for, and set into action. That I'm so not enough, that they found it preferable to leave and start over somewhere else as if I'd never existed. Three weeks out, the window of sympathy and understanding from coworkers has closed. I found a therapist when my partner left me, but the therapist has no idea the depths of where I'm at. The only one who really knows is my dog, and thank god, because she's the only reason I can find to hang on another day.","1"

I really really don't want to be here anymore. There's nothing left for me. Please let me be with her, I want to be with her again.  ","1"
"I'm a pedophile. I admit it. I'm attracted to underage girls. I'm not sure I can keep going on knowing that I could one day act on these desires, ruining someone elses life in the process. I am 28 years old and have had these feelings since I was about 19. I've never abused a child and never would, but have viewed images online, so-called ""jailbait"" pictures of teenage girls. This has been kept hidden for so long but as I grow older I see friends from high school and college getting married and having kids of their own, I wonder what the fuck is wrong with me? Why can't I just be normal? I live with my parents and I'm fairly certain they know now too. I think I've heard them talk about it downstairs, and I can feel their anger every time they look at me now. Next time I'm in my car, I might just pull over somewhere and jump off an overpass. I'm sorry. I'm sorry I'm a disgusting piece of shit, I'm sorry I couldn't be what my parents wanted me to be, I'm sorry for indulging in those possibly illegal images.

I'm fed up, I'm tired of filling out applications, calling managers to see if they've reviewed my application, endlessly scrolling through Craigslist ads.

"Ive been suicidal and depressed since middle school, now Im 20. I attended my first counseling session this week and I basically heard what I needed to but didnt want to hear. The counselor helped me realize I wasnt challenged enough as a kid both at school or at home (everything has always come very easy to me) and now Im not used to facing adult responsibilities. But I told her I truly dont WANT to face these responsibilities expected of me, I was not asked to be born, I was thrust into this horrible society by force, I really wish I had been aborted since my parents often tell me I was a mistake. I dont want to go to school or work or find a career or spouse and have kids and die old shrively and ugly. I wanna die now so badly. I thought I could change and become better but maybe I am too far gone. I hate every single thing about life and living and this world and I hate myself most of all. I suffer from eating disorders, anxiety, depression, and many other things. I know Im better off than most with a roof over my head and all but Im so unsatisfied with my life. The counselor also noted no one is happy in college or their careers which makes sense but does that make me WRONG for wanting to be happy most of the time? We are all basically slaves to a big brother type force. Everything we do is to benefit them while we become more miserable. Our president is a fucking rapist for fucks sake I hardly ever feel safe anymore as a young Hispanic Gay woman. I want to escape this viscous cycle but I have no way of killing myself (successfully). I hate that I am so young but already filled with so much hate and sadness and basically done with it all. Im hesitant to continue counseling because its worsening my anxiety but I know this is part of the process to getting better. Im just so TIRED anxiety consumes me 24/7 I want everything to stop I want quiet and nothingness I cant take anymore pain ","1"

I used to have hobbies like computer programming and photography but now I just dont do anything.

"I tried to kill myself last Saturday night. My uncle didn't wake up the next morning instead of me, and I feel like it's my fault. I feel like it's my responsibility to live a happy, fulfilling life now because I owe him. He would want me to. But I'm just more depressed than ever, the guilt and pressure to be happy like everyone wants me to be is getting to me just from everything with my uncle alone. I can't tell my family because they're already grieving, and I don't want to worry them more. There's not much they could do to help me that I couldn't already do myself.I have bipolar disorder and BPD among other disorders I live with, so I know this depressive episode will pass. But this is the worst that it's been in a long time. Out of nowhere things got really bad, and last Saturday night I found myself 8 stories up on top of a parking deck, looking down. After hours of staring down and crying and thinking I decided to go home and overdose instead. Obviously, it didn't work. I was throwing up and feeling like shit for a few days afterwards. After other past suicide attempts, I've realized I wanted to live, and afterwards I've been happy to be alive. But this time is different. I feel worse than ever, maybe from my uncle passing away? I'm not sure. All I want to do is disappear. I think about death almost constantly. I can barely bring myself to smile. Today was my first day back at work since Saturday and everyone knew something was wrong. I can't even fake it anymore. All day today I thought about going back to that parking deck and just doing it.I've thought about going back to a mental health facility in my area. I've stayed there twice. There are more than a few things keeping me from going there though..I don't have health insurance. My dad lost his job a few weeks ago, and with that my family lost all of our health benefits. There's no way I could afford to pay for a hospital on my own. My family might be willing to help but I don't want to put that on them.I would also be labeled an addict and forced to go through a recovery program. I smoke marijuana on a daily basis. It really helps me with my depression, anxiety, mood swings, paranoia, etc... Just because I would test positive means that they'd make me focus on my ""addiction"" problem and push my other mental health problems to the side. I've seen it happen to people in there, and they leave without getting any real help that they need.I also stopped taking my medication a few months ago. Stopped seeing my psychiatrist and therapist, all of that. I'm tired of having to rely on medication to function like a normal person, to be able to feel happy. I'm open to medication options, if I could find any that would actually work. And that's without even considering the cost of a psychiatrist and medication, and at the hospital they'd force medication down my throat and add that to the list of bills.. Anyways. Going to the hospital or going back to a therapist or psychiatrist or whatever doctor isn't an option anymore since I don't have health insurance. Can't afford it. Getting help is too expensive, which is sad.I guess I'm kind of at a loss. I'm not feeling nearly as suicidal as I was earlier, but it's only because I gave in and cut myself. I don't want to want to die every second I'm awake. My best friend told me that he knows I don't want to die, and it made me angry. He doesn't want me to die. My family doesn't want me to die. But I genuinely do and I hate that I do. I can't shake the feeling that I'm not going to make it to Christmas this year.I guess I'm just venting/ranting. I don't expect anyone to read or respond to this.. I don't know what the point is. ","1"
"My friend has never had an really easy life. She never got along with her parents, I remember in elementary school she would always come to school with red eyes, presumably due to crying. Fast forward to when she turned 18, she had a huge fight with her parents that led to her getting kicked out of her home. She bounced around with friends before renting a place for a while. It was around this time that she starting hanging out with her girlfriend heavily, like to the point where she lived with her. All seemed to be fine until they broke up. My friend... she never really got over her and it has plagued her since. When everyone went off to college, she happened to end up living only a few rooms down from my friend. She saw her everyday. Saw her with new guys and girls, enjoying life without her and because we all have the same friend group, they saw each other all the time. This along withtrouble adjusting to the college life, led my friend over the tipping point. She has asked multiple people,friends and acquaintances alike to end her life. The first timethis happened was last year, its now happened twice, with the lasttime being 3 weeks ago. As a result, she has been also getting into harder drugs, mostly heroin. Now she isnt addicted per se but she has done it a handful of times and i dont know how long it takes to get addicted. Basically my question is how do I help my friend. I am way out of my depth, she is a very stubborn and untrusting person and its very hard to get her to like the idea of telling more people because she is worried that people with stop treating her like normal. I feel that if I betray her trust and tell people, she will close off for good and I won't be able to do anything to help.Idk if thats too little information or too much, I amjust fucking terrified for my friend and I'm only a dumbass 20 year old. Please help.TLDR: Read the whole thing, my friend's life is in danger.","1"

It was very rushed after a suicide attempt and the psych I'm seeing now isn't too sure of it. Which is interesting.All I know is that something's... wrong with my wiring. I've had brutal and crippling depression over the years but... this it's more like I wrestle with suicidal thoughts on an immensely frequent basis.

Even when I'm happy, I'm often thinking - ""This would be a really great day to off myself."" It's weird. This is one of those...

"Doing okay in college, but constantly just getting by and doing a minimal amount of work because I have no self control or drive to do any school work. If I thought I could make it in life without a degree I would drop out right now, but the future is looking hard for everyone so I feel like ill just be a burden if I don't do something with myself. I have been working on an album in my free time that I was supposed to release 6 months ago but now everytime I listen to it I want to make a million changes which I don't have the time to do, and I can't even get inspired anymore.5 years ago I was in a similar funk in high school and when I got hospitalized for an attempt I told myself at least I have music to live for, because it was one of the only things that made me happy. It still is that but i feel less and less like I could make it as an artist if I chose to go that route. And if I don't start making waves now it would be impossible to do it when I have a full time job.If I had no responsibility I would move across the country somewhere and focus on it, but my parents have pretty clear expectations of what I need to achieve and disappointing them more than I already have would kill me. But going down this route I always feel like I have nothing to look forward to. I obviously don't know the future but it seems like the only way ill be able to support myself is to get a degree and work. I just don't see myself being happy.I can't quit college, but how do I make it more survivable?

The person I thought I was going to marry suddenly broke up with me three weeks ago and doesn't give two shits about me anymore. I have no friends, and my family is miles away. I've hit rock bottom, and I don't see an end in sight and I want nothing more than to end my misery.But the only thing stopping me right now is my sister's dog, who I'm pet-sitting for. I can't bear the thought of leaving him alone when I'm gone, so I plan on ending it once my sister gets back. The world would be better off without me anyway.","1"
"He was being bullied by someone and said he was going to kill himself. I see him the next day and he jams a bus ticket from me and i snap at him. Then he calls me and said thats the last call im hearing from him. I kept texting him sorry and dont die and he isnt listening. He said its all my fault. Wtf? How do i cope with thisAnd will i go to hell?","1"
"I've got a 9mm auto and prescription pills. I've been contemplating which one it will be. I'm 45 and lost everything after losing my job and falling into depression. I've had a hard life and I've fought hard to make it this far. Never knew my father and my mother was locked up when I was 12. I live alone and I do have friends but they are mainly in another city which I left 2 years ago. Things have turned out horribly and I'm just tired of fighting. I've had suicidal thoughts before but this is different, I know this has to end. I'm either going to be homeless or dead, I have no other options. ","1"
"TLDR at the beginning because fuck me that text is way longer than I expected it to be; Im probably going to kill myself tomorrow night. Via bleeding to death in a bathtub. If a miracle happens at the concert Ill be seeing before Ill commit suicide, lets say I make a new circle of friends or even meet a girl which is interested in me, Ill maybe think about it. But all in all,- I just want to leave this fucking planet once and for all.Over the course of the last few months my life has made a few heavy and impactful unexpected turns. A brief overview,- Im your usual 18 year old outsider who sucks at socialising and isnt good with girls. Currently Im attending commercial high school and will graduate in 1  years. I think about suicide, killing others and dying in general daily and cried out for help multiple times,- I wasnt heard.The first thing that got me to spiral down into what I believe is not depression but just utter solitude, anger, angst, fear and sadness are my parents. One day, were the perfect family, no not the other day, the other 364 days a year its a fucking shithole. I quit ice hockey because I grew tired of it. Parents take the absolute piss. I dyed my hair black and bleach-blonde half a year later and tried various styles out. I get yelled at, my dad ignored me and just despised me for that time. I see myself slipping in high school and what do I get? Support? Comfort? Hell no, I get yelled at, made fun of and get told that Im an absolute idiot and a failure. By my own fucking parents. The perfect parent-son relationship, right? The fact that my sister whos three years older than me and basically did everything right in her life and is now the poster child doesnt make it any better.Fasten your seatbelts, ladies and gentlemen, heres the next part of why I want to fucking kill myself. Ive never had a girlfriend or even something remotely close to that. I tried dating and actually met a few decent girls, one of which I almost started a relationship with,- but then found out that she was just mentally abusing me to get me to buy her things and serve as an attention-giver. Great. Since then I couldnt function properly anymore in terms of talking to people. Ive got the feeling that whatever I say or express,- they justdo not really care. I feel ugly, mentally and physically even though I know its not true. The few friends I have tell me Im decent looking. I dont hate my looks either but it just feels like that everyone I dont know, especially girls and women think that Im not attractive at all. All of this,- you might wonder: Well everyone goes through this. That might be true. But people recover from it. Iabsolutely didnt. The incident with the girl who emotionally and mentally abused me now lies 2 and a half years back and its still holding me down. I still think about that person almost daily and how I couldve probably reached a happy ending in that part of my life. I havent had a circle of good friends for four years now. The people in which I take interest in seem to not even care that I seem interested. E.G. that one time at a comic con, one of the few social gatherings I actually do attend because Im a huge bloody nerd, I casually talked to a, in my eyes, cute girl. We had conversations about various comics, video games and movies. When we were to say goodbye, I asked for her number. She just gave me a weird look, shook her head while cringing and said nooo. and walked away. In my head I was like Hey, alrightI guess Ill just go fuck myself then? swiftly looked through everything, bought what I wanted and headed home again. Couldve been a cool day but that incident was just enough for me to assume that Im a failure of mankind that cant even socialise properly.I feel like Im an alien from another planet. I cant seem to fit in, not even in my sort of thing which would be the alternative, grunge and rock genre of people. I cant seem to get accepted for what I am by my own parents. Im literally unable to initiate a relationship, and fuck me I crave one so bad. Ill probably end up dropping out of high school because I cant focus on school. ThenI dont even know. Then Ill probably jump in front of a train. And to not go through all of this absolute bullshit of a path that will lead to my death I decided to make a plan. Im going to end my life.This weekend Im going to be attending a concert from one of my favourite grunge/rock bands. My parents wont be returning until Monday morning. I dont give a shit if Im shy or socially awkward, Ill just do it since thats the last thing I want to do before I die. Just rock out, drink, smoke and have a blast,- basically going out with a bang. Maybe Ill meet people there, maybe even a nice girl. But at this point I dont even care. Maybe I do. I dont know. It really depends on what happens tomorrow. One last time I will try to spark up conversations with people, mostly girls and try to get affection,- I cant remember the last time I felt accepted, was hugged or even loved. When its over and everybodys going home, Ill head to the train station, catch the train which will take me home and listen to my favourite music while staring out the window as if I was in a sad music video,- who doesnt love to do that? At home, Ill wait until the bathtub is filled to the brink with hot water. I always thought that cutting ones wrists is one of the mostwell lets say weirdest and most beautiful ways to go out. Just thinking about your life in those last few minutes you have until you bleed out must be sad and beautiful at the same time. That all the hassle, that pain and the regret is at an end.","1"
"I don't get why we play this game. It just leads to sadness & unmet expectations founded on misperceptions of reality. I have no motivation to do anything other than whatever my now ex gf would've asked me to do because I have no desire to partake in the system & it's psychoanalytical game. Every day I think about either pulling an Alexander Supertramp to either Ethiopia or the mountains of the northern US but I also remember I'll see pain there too. I wish I had a passion or something that makes me want to keep breathing. ","1"
"This is my second time posting here... i first posted this on /r/depression , i really feel like i'm falling in despair.Sorry for my bad english. I just can't take it anymore, first of all some days ago i tried to kill myself but it didn't go well, i don't have many friends, i can't always ask my mom to help me because she feels bad when i tell her how i always feel bad, she and my gf are the only one who knows about my suicide attemp, my gf got super upset and i understand her, after all, its all my fault, i have been screaming to her that i seriously need help but she says:""Well, you are always sad anyway"" and i feel way worse, i really don't know what to do, i feel so bad, everything feels worse and i have been thinking about trying to kill myself again, by hanging myself but the painless way (breaking my neck), or going to the train station and throw myself to the rails. I just want to stop feeling this horrible sensation, this loneliness, i want to stop thinking.Just now i talked to my gf, she said she will listen me and that she said those things yesterday b/c she was angry, but now she just told me:""are you going to continue with that""- This is why i told you that it was bad to express myself""i think so""What the actual fuck, does she really even care for me?Fucking kill me, i just want to die, please someone, anyone just kill me, i can't take this anymore, i can't take those feelings, i can't take this loneliness, everything feels bad.","1"
"I'm currently failing school. I have zero motivation to do work or get anything done or start thinking about careers. I'm most likely not going to graduate high school this year. All this is because time is getting closer and closer to when I'm supposed to kill myselfEverything is pointless now and it's so difficult to not be able to tell people why I'm not doing anything. I can't just say ""Oh, it's because I'm not going to be alive soon so I don't really see the point in trying anymore"" and I doubt I'll go to mental health professionals again as the last time I went, they failed me and brushed me off. It's just really odd and surreal and tedious doing anything when you're not going to be alive any longer than a few years. I want to completely lose my mind by then so that maybe I won't feel bad about hurting certain people. I don't know. Everything is so unreal.","1"
"I just don't see any point in keep on living anymore when it is clear that there is nowhere left to go but down. College was probably the happiest period of my life, I didn't make any friends or lasting relationship but I didn't care, I was getting good grades, in honors STEM classes, from a prestigious school and surely, respectable petit-bourgeoisiedom awaited once I'm outside the gate, I thought. Well turns out my options were jobs that pay 2000-4500 in this town where the mean monthly income is 6000. I'm 25, I have no friend or acquaintance to speak of (never had none past junior high); I live with my family whom I loathe but have to nonetheless take up more and more responsibility for the upkeep thereof; I have no hobbies or interests other than the consumption of prepackaged consumerist products (games and movies); I have a crippling fear of socialization and absolutely do not know how to talk normally to others so I never do; my crappy job leaves me with no time or energy for self-improvement, such as studying for GRE or losing weight; meanwhile all around me I see my normie coworkers getting married and posting their happy honeymoon photos in thailand, and I see college classmate who did worse than me proudly posting photos of themselves being admitted into med schools or being hired by illumina.....you get the idea. I don't even have anyone to vent this to, other than you internet strangers. I don't know why I am writing all this since I don't think you can talk me out of stuffing my head into a helium bag at this point, but some words of sympathy might sooth me on my way out. thanks for reading.","1"

"I don't know what to do anymore.I've been struggling with this for 8 years hoping things would get better and every time things seem to get better my life takes a 180 and im back to crying waking up and crying going to sleep. I've waited and waited for things to get better, but they never do. I've been myself, I've been trying to be something else, anything just to get someone to care about me, ask me to hang out, ask me how I'm doing, hell even just text me. Never ends up that way though, does it? I always have to contact first, I got answers, in the beginning. Then they just gradually start ignoring me, and I don't understand why. I try to look at myself from other peoples view and I try changing the things they might find so appaling, to no use.The thought of suicide stays with me every waking moment, and it has for atleast 3 years, and to be honest I don't know how much more of this complete loneliness I can take before I succumb to my thoughts and end the pain.I don't really know why I'm even writing this. Probably just to vent knowing that all you really can do is tell me that things are gonna get better when I've already been telling myself that for all these years.","1"

"I don't know if this belongs in suicide watch. I don't want to commit suicide, but I think my friend might have just done so. I guess I'll know for sure in a few days, when he doesn't contact me. He was or is severely depressed. I'm not going to talk about all of his issues here, because there are a lot of them. The only relevant information for now is that he is or was suicidal, that I've talked him out of suicide before, and he didn't have a lot of friends. I was one of his only friends, and he is or was also one of mine.Two nights ago we were talking on the phone about our relationships. I told him that I once told my [current] boyfriend that I loved him but that he didn't say that he loved me back. He told me that he was once in a relationship with a girl and the same thing happened, and that it made him lose interest in her, sort of insinuating that that same thing might happen to me. He was trying to give me advice, I guess. I started crying. He didn't exactly know that I would have reacted the way I did, but then again that isn't really the type of thing you say to someone if you're trying to help them with something. I told him that I needed some time alone and hung up.Now, I have a problem with being confident in relationships. Long story short, I've dated some shitty people and people who made me feel insecure, guilty, and generally badly about myself (and I'm sure most of you can understand or have experienced what I'm talking about). Because of that I've felt really insecure about a lot of my relationships, not just the romantic/sexual ones. The guy I'm dating now is a total sweetheart and we've been dating for almost 9 months now, but in the beginning of the relationship I was really scared about losing him because I can get really emotional at times. A month or so ago I finally started to feel more confident about this relationship because it's lasted so long.So, after I hung up on my friend (and went to sleep, because it was night time), he sent me a bunch of messages saying that he was sorry, he didn't mean it, etc. I know that he didn't mean to hurt me, even though he didn't use the best advice. When I woke up, I told him that I would talk to him for a few days because I was angry about what he said, but that he shouldn't be afraid of losing me as a friend. I just needed some time to ""recuperate,"" essentially. Last night he messaged me again, saying that he was 'leaving,"" and that he was sorry. From talking to him before when he was like this I knew that he meant that he was going to kill himself. Then he blocked me and deactivated his account before I could reply.Not too long ago, he activated his account I guess, because he started talking to me again. He said that the way he said goodbye last night wasn't the proper way to go. Then he sent a few long messages that all boiled down to him not wanting to need people anymore when they didn't need him. He said that hurting me was essentially the tipping point. Then he blocked me again, and hasn't talked to me since.If my reaction to what he said was his tipping point, I don't know if I'll ever be able to forgive myself. On the other hand, what he said really did hurt me. It's going to take everything in me to convince myself that it wouldn't be my fault if he killed himself, and even then I don't know if it will be enough. Does this mean that I should be completely selfless and not be offended when people deeply hurt my feelings? I don't even know if this is me being ""offended"" or if it's more me just being scared and hurt. And now I feel awful for making this post about myself, when it should be about my friend possibly just committing suicide. I don't even know what to think anymore.","1"
"If I couldn't hate myself more, I'm even too indecisive and lazy to plan my own fucking death.It's got to the point where I'm just making bets to myself like ""if I get less than a C on this exam, I'll commit suicide before the end of the year"" and shit like that. Sadly enough, I've ""won"" those bets, and I probably will keep ""winning"" (or in my perspective ""losing"") them because I'm shit at everything, including my own suicide planning.I'm just floating through life at this point; I honestly couldn't give less of a fuck about anything anymore.","1"
"Ive thought about killing myself for 17 years now at least 2 to 3 times a day. The sad part is I dont want to hurt anyone by doing it but Im constantly depressed and tired, so tired. Even while while happy it doesnt last long, I turned to drugs as a teenager and alcohol. Ive been fighting to try and stay sober for over 2 years. Alcohol isnt a problem. But I keep slipping up and using Meth, Im not strung out and have bouts of sobriety by then Ill have a binge. Im tired of it. I truly believe Im saved by Jesus but I just cant seem to give my addiction over to him. I know I need mental help but I wont tell anyone how I feel. I believe that if Im not either committed somewhere by the end of this week. My brothers go to their Moms this weekend. So Ill wait until this weekend so they wont have to see it. If my Mum or Pops see this, Im sorry but I literally cant stand being on this planet anymore. My time with yall were the best Ive ever had and I love yall. If anyone reading this its the only cry for help Ill give. My name is Otis Gibson and I live on 380 Horseshoe Lake Road in Columbia Louisiana 71418 and by 1 am Saturday if God of someone doesnt intervene Ill finally be free.","1"
"NOTE: This is not advising everyone to avoid seeking help. I am not saying don't take medication. It is not in my power to give anyone advice. Everyone is different. This is only my experience.Idk if this belongs in suicidewatch. It's not asking for or giving help, but it's too suicidal to go in depression.I recently got my medication dose increased, and it is ""working."" Basically, it made things worse for the long run.Before, the only thing keeping me from suicide was OCD. (I hate change, plus it takes a lot of work.)Now, my literal mood (anger, sadness) has been stabilized at pretty near neutral. However, it doesn't fix the real issue, which is more of how my mind works. I will always despise society. I'll never fit in with all of this. It's all a stupid joke.Yeah, ""you don't have to fit in,"" some may say. But if I don't want to be living on the streets, I have to ""be social"", ~~go into crippling debt~~ go to college, maybe find a job. Struggle to make ends meet due to ~~the failing economy~~ ""not working hard enough.""I just wanted the balance to tip enough to end it. Turns out talking about the issue was a mistake. Therapy is the same. I will not discuss how broken I am, because it'll make me look worse, and it will do nothing. It's done nothing but a weekly rant session. Now I'm more trapped than ever... My personality hates life, but now my raw emotion is like ""meh. whatever.""tldr; If you want to take antidepressants, you better make sure you'll have something to live for. If you want to go to therapy, see if your problem is fixable.I posted this to share my story. Not everyone has depression that can be fixed with medication and/or therapy. I want to share how it feels.","1"
"I have hated my dad as long as I can remember. But because I'm a teenage girl everyone thinks it's just teenage angst, but it's so much more than that. It's not my parents, just my dad.In fact, I love my mom a lot more than most teenagers. I'm fifteen and when I can't sleep or I have a nightmare, I'll go sleep in her bed like a child would. I've always loved her like this.And I've always hated my dad.My earliest memory is when my brother was five and I was eight. It was the first time we had to see our dad since the divorce. My brother was sobbing because he didn't want to go. I didn't want to go either, but my mom said I had to be strong for him and she had me convince him it was going to be okay. We've both always hated him and the only way I could get him to stop crying was to say we were going to a toy store. I still feel so guilty about lying to him like that. He doesn't even remember it, but I just feel like such a terrible sibling.I wish our dad was a decent human being. My entire life I've had to be strong for my brother when we went. He would always sob and meltdown, and I felt the same way. But I couldn't cry because I had to be happy and try to make it as good as I could for my brother. I love my brother and I would do anything for him, but I'm just so done with everything. I've been strong for so long and I can't do this anymore. My dad is so awful.Everything I've ever been interested in, he's ruined for me. As soon as I could read and write, I'd write long stories. I had a spiral notebook I would write in. I would write pages of fantasy stories, but I would also occasionally write about something in my life if it was bothering me. I think I was twelve when it happened. I was feeling kind of suicidal. I wasn't planning it or anything, I was just very frustrated with several things in my life.  So I wrote a story about a girl who kills herself. I wrote it, felt better, and didn't think of it again. I went to my dad's for the weekend. When I came back, my mom sat me down. She told me my dad had read my notebook and insisted that I was depressed and I was going to kill myself. My mom understood that it was just a story and she didn't make a big deal out of it. But I just felt so betrayed. I stopped writing in my notebook because I didn't want him reading anything. I started to be depressed and actually considered suicide because my only coping mechanism was taken away from me and I didn't want to open up to the parents that ruined it for me. It wasn't my mom's fault, she's always completely respected my privacy, but at the time I was upset with both of them. That Christmas I asked for one of those fancy journal things with the lock and the secret compartment. My mom got it for me. I chose a four digit pin I would remember, and if the code was entered wrong, it had a voice say something about trying again.This worked out for a while. His house was small, so my brother and I would sleep in sleeping bags on the living room floor. One night I got woken up by the voice on the diary. I looked over, and my dad was trying to guess the password. I pretended to still be asleep, but I think he realized I was awake because he went to his room after that. The thing that kept the diary closed was pretty much just a piece of cardboard. I figured that he would cut open the diary. So when I had a few minutes alone at my mom's house, I tore out every page I had written on. I put them in the bathtub. My mom loves candles, so it was easy to find a lighter. I burned the pages and rinsed the ashes down the drain. Even though the diary didn't have anything else written in it, I buried it in the woods behind our backyard. I stopped writing. I hardly did anything during this time. I barely remember the next couple years, so let's skip to this year. I was having problems with school. My mom has ADD, and she saw a lot of the symptoms in me and wanted to get me tested. My dad was very against it, he said I was just lazy and my mom needed to discipline me better. My mom didn't care what he said and got me tested anyways, and yup, I have ADD. They recommended meds, and my dad was very against it. My mom wants what's best for me, so she got me the meds and just didn't tell him.That was over the summer. Fall comes, and I start at a new school. My old school didn't offer journalism, and this one does, and I joined. So I was finally back into writing. I loved it and would talk about it at any chance I got. What did my dad say about my new hobby? ""Journalism is a dying industry. Enjoy it as a hobby, but don't focus on it. You'll never make any money with it."" I know how wrong that is, but it still hurt. Aren't your parents supposed to encourage you and tell you you can be anything? He's also a firm believer in gender roles.  Whenever we visit, we have to do chores right away which is stupid enough on its own. You don't get to see us often, and when you do you make us do chores? I would think he'd like to spend time with us. We're always given the same types of chores. I have to stay inside and do the dishes and laundry. My brother has to do all the outside work. Something my brother is very passionate about is cooking. He'll spend hours creating elaborate meals. My dad refuses to acknowledge this. If my brother starts talking about anything cooking related, he'll change the subject right away. I want to be a firefighter when I grow up, but I won't mention anything about it to him, because I know he'll just discourage me. He constantly talks about how if I get a boyfriend, he'll have to know how to fix cars and play football. He'd probably have a heart attack if he knew I was a lesbian.A couple months pass. My sister (eight years older than me and has a different dad who wants nothing to do with her) was pregnant. At 25 weeks something went wrong, and she had an emergency c section. The baby didn't make it. His name was Brookston. We were all so excited for him. I don't really like human babies very much, but it was my very first nephew and I realized I was actually pretty excited to be an aunt. I missed a lot of school because it was obviously very upsetting. My mom started me with a therapist. After a few visits, the therapist said he thinks I'm on the autism spectrum. At first I didn't believe it, but after doing some research, it made complete sense. My mom wanted to get me officially tested for it, mainly so I could get additional help in school. Not special ed, stuff like being able to have a weighted blanket (my mom works with mentally disabled adults, and they had an extra weighted blanket that my mom brought home for me after what my therapist said) and get extra time for assignments in subjects I struggle in. My dad refuses to accept it and won't let me get tested. My mom can't do it anyways this time because now I'm under his insurance.I'm not even sure what finally broke me, but I started melting down any time I had to visit with him. My psychiatrist said that so much had happened and that I just needed time to adjust, and to avoid further stress for a couple weeks. She said I needed to stop visits with my dad until I felt better. My mom told him that, and he flipped out on her. He said he won't pay child support if he doesn't get to see us. The next day I come out of school to walk home, like always. But his car is there and I end up spending the night at his house. He always springs visits on me last minute. One Saturday I had plans with someone, which is very rare for me. In the past he's complained about how antisocial I am. But Friday night he says to me ""Do you have plans tomorrow night? Because now you do!"" His plans for me were to go to a fucking bible study. I'm an atheist, and he continues to force me to go to religious functions despite what I say.  I keep having to visit with him and I'm so fucking tired of having to put up with a man that doesn't respect my mental health or interests. I feel unsafe at his house because he never locks his doors and keeps several guns under his bed, unlocked. But now I'm starting to think that's a good thing. Dying would be much better than having to put up with him. I don't want to leave my brother alone, but hopefully his daughter killing herself would be enough of a wake up call. If he's awful enough to not change after that, they could probably go to court and give my mom full custody. I have three years until I'm eighteen and I would never have to see him again. But that would mean my brother would be there all alone for three yeard and I can't do that to him, but I can't put up with this for another six years. I'm thinking next visit will be my last.","1"
"for my entire life i've been dealing with different ways to really hurt myself and kill myself but I really do not want to do it. Right now it's at its worse. Because usually I could handle by holding my hands down or restraining myself but this time its far too much. I want to breathe in so deep that my lungs will pop. Its been a though on my mind for way longer than any other time i've had a problem like this and I really need help. Can't find anything about it online. It really sucks and I just want to get past it. I'm really not a depressed person. And if I ever am, I never see suicide as an action to take. Life is amazing! and i've had an amazing life so far and I know suicide wouldn't do anything good for me. I really really love life and I'm scared of dying.","1"

"My question is...why? Why do I need to keep fighting? Why can't I give up? Am I supposed to struggle for the rest of my life - not to be happy - but to just maintain a neutral emotional state? I don't have any hobbies...nothing interests me in the slightest. I don't have any friends...I find people to be utterly useless, selfish, and disgusting. I'm 28 years old and never been on a date. I hate my job, but there isn't anything else that I want to do. I have nothing in this world that I want to do, nothing that I find worth doing.

"I found myself Googling suicide chat rooms the past couple of days. This entire week I've woken up and felt like nothing mattered and everything was hopeless and I didn't want to get out of bed and well felt like I was outside of myself. Even now as I'm driving in the car and talking to text this I just feel like there's nothing that I have to live for even though that there is. I have plenty to live for I just don't feel like going on anymore. Has a lot to do with things that I love like playing music in a band ending and adult things that I thought I would be more ready for at the age of 29 like starting to talk about starting a family with my wife of two years. I have so much to look forward to but I just don't want to be here for it. I don't know why I'm here like on this planet here I want to be free from negativity but I can't get away from it. Sorry for the bad grammar and terrible punctuation. Honestly just need some words of advice and I hope something sticks. ","1"
"I want to end it. I don't know how to keep going. I lost a lot of money on a stupid bet, and I've got so little left. It really finally hit me tonight that my money was really gone and I wasn't gonna win. I don't know what to do. All I can think is how hard i worked for months and months to get it and not i've wasted it all. I can't believe i was so stupid. I want to die I don't know how to keep living. I've got no job, and I dropped out of school and have no skills or talents. everything seems so overwhelming. I cry everyday and i don't feel happy doing anything anymore. there is no enjoyment left and everything is a chore. I want to lay in bed all day even though my body is sore from not moving. I've gained so much weight I can't even walk properly like I did before. I have to walk with my legs in a weird position so my thighs don't rub and its causing foot and knee pain. I am hopeless and so lonely. I'm a disappointment to everyone and the world will be better off without me. ","1"

"Its good to be optimistic to a point but after a while you just look stupid. I have to be realistic at this point. Things will not get better. Im tired of hearing that things will get better and that I should just wait because better things are coming. I cant put into words how tired I am. How tired my soul is. I have thought about taking my life almost daily since I was 11. I am almost 31. When is it supposed to start letting up? I get little tastes of good things and then they are ripped away. All Ive ever wanted is to find my purpose in life. Im beginning to believe there is no purpose. Ive wanted many things out of life but most of all to become a wife and mother. My husband left me for someone else soon after we were married. Together for years before but finally after going through with the wedding he was able to tell me just how little he thought of me. The plan was to start a family and now that is no longer an option. I was in a life threatening car accident that no one can believe I survived.  What is the point of all of this? I always said I cant do it much longer. Ive tried praying, exercising, writing, talking, medication and have had more involvement in mental health treatment than you know. I know that I am a burden. That is not something my brain is lying to me about. I have been told that several times by multiple people. I have been distancing myself from others and no one seems to notice or care. In one last attempt I finally let myself be open to a new relationship after years and he put his hands on me tonight. I have always been stronger than this. Tonight I am not. I dont know if anyone will read this or if reddit will even allow me to post since Im so new. I hope everyone on here has better luck than I did. Im so tired and Im finally going to try to find peace and rest.","1"
"I wanted to get off my chest behind a mask that nobody could point out to me. I'm a walking pile of shit that honestly should be publicly executed for being such a degenerate. I don't know where to start with, but the organization of this is going to be awful and ranty, I want to get the full details of how much of a piece of shit person I am. First off I am a lying cunt. Now its not really bad except when it comes to my parents that I still live with as a 21 year old. I lie to them virtually about everything and they have no idea what their son is becoming. They used to rule me with an iron fist, but after attempting suicide their tune has changed where they don't mess me with me now. I've attempted suicide multiple times, I really regret failing, would of done the whole world a favor. I'm in college classes and have been for a couple years, I seem to pass a class then fail a class. My parents who are paying for my school have no idea I ever failed a single one, I just lie about degree reqs and what classes I'm taking, they don't know that I'm actually taking english 121 for the third time not taking english 122. I keep telling myself I'll get my grades together, but I never do because I'm too much of a piece of shit to do my school work or to show up to fucking class. No I'd rather sit at home all day in front of the computer whining to reddit how much the world is a big meanie to me. Speaking of sitting at home, my room hasn't been cleaned in over two years. Its a pig sty with garbage all over the place. My bathroom is the place of nightmares, a god awful odor looms over the gross scum and mold from not cleaning it over a year. I work a dead end retail job that doesn't make enough money for what I want, so sometimes I'll steal my moms card to have her pay for gas this week, so I can have a little extra money to buy what I want. What do I buy? Oh I buy drugs. Pot and acid are the only things that make me happy. I abuse LSD. If I have the supply I will drop it twice a week. I'm so pathetic that I cry all the time about not getting a girlfriend. Hearing my description, its not a surprise anyone would date me, and thats not factoring the facts that I'm ugly and bipolar. It drives me so mad that I can't get a girl when its pretty fucking obvious why I can't. I cry myself to sleep over it all the time. I have a bed sheet that I folded up into the shape of a woman and I pretend it's my girlfriend, I name her Sierra. On top of this I masturbate a ridiculous amount of times, 3+ times a day is the norm. All I ever do in my free time is do drugs and stare at my computer screen, or hang out with friends and do drugs and stare at my computer screen with them. I have lots of debt from the mental hospital and I'm already behind paying it off because I spend my money on drugs. I have a warrant for my arrest that I was supposed to take care of in July. My drivers license expired in June, I doubt I'll take care of it anytime soon. I have no work ethic, I'm a lazy fuck. TL;Dr: I'm a walking piece of shit, why shouldn't I kill myself?","1"
"I have always been a fuck up. I am the black sheep and problem child in my crappy family. I flunked out of university twice, spent the last year sitting at home unemployed. I cut all my friends out of my life out of shame of how far I fell. I called the suicide hotline only to have them send cops to my place and humiliate me in front of my whole family, who made me say I did the whole thing as a joke. I don't have any will to live anymore or the energy to try to start over. I just want to die.","1"
"I'm going to be alone forever, I think. I'm 23 and have never been in a relationship, and have only been on one date with one girl--that I thought went alright but found out the following day that it decidedly did not and I realized that I apparently have a blissful lack of self-awareness at times. I'm really just wondering, should I kill myself? (Read: give me attention, please; I'm a baby who can't deal with the emotions resulting from consistent rejection and I really want a higher likelihood of people reading the entirety of the following text, which will surely be a lengthy complaint about my relatively good life).I'm exhausted of being alone. I can't escape the depression I've been in since about age 12. It just seems an impossible task as most of my depression revolves around the fact that I am desperately lonely, with hardly any friends and certainly no intimacy or cuddling or romantic walks on the beach or even kinky tie-me-to-the-bed-and-tickle-me-until-I-cry sex. So what's the point in living? That's really not a rhetorical question. Because, as I see it, lonelines causes my depression, but, in turn, I am lonely because depressive symptoms isolate me socially and drastically lower my energy levels which probably make me appear boring and undesirable. This then creates more loneliness, thus feeding my depression, ad infinitum. It simply seems to be a circle with no exit point. How could anything ever change?I'm not even so bad looking. I mean, gee, I think I'm downright hot and I like guys too so my opinion is clearly unbiased... okay I guess being me makes me a little biased. But I'd say I'm a solid 5/10 from the eyes of others, and higher from at least several eyes. And, in my opinion, my personality is kind, appreciative of and engaged in other people's interests, and fun--I certainly can make my platonic friends laugh a great deal and they love me a lot, though I see almost no one regularly anymore because of life circumstances and thus never really get to leave the house. My only method of dating is through tinder, which I've grown to hate and has counterintuitively seemed to increase my loneliness despite a summer full of fun drugs and sex and cuddling, some of which I probably don't even remember. I even got some spank-me-because-i've-been-bad sex and some you-have-to-beg-me-for-sex-and-call-me-a-goddess-or-you-don't-get-any sex. Hot. Also I think at some point I had panda ears on but that was during a vacation in Florida which is a weird place anyway and i was on LSD half the week so maybe I hallucinated it. \_()_/The problem isn't even low-self esteem or confidence. I think someone would really love getting to know me if I was actually given a chance. But I'm exhausted and I just want to end it before it even begins because I don't think I could take finally getting into a relationship and it ending after month because maybe my depression doesn't heal quickly enough, or when the person realizes they don't actually like me so much. I can hardly take minor rejections here and there without sinking into a deeper state of sadness. I try so hard to tell myself that it'll be okay and that someone, somewhere out there will actually appreciate what I have to offer another person and the world, but the knot in my stomach when I say those things hurts and I know I don't believe it.

"I'm such a pathetic attention whore, I'll do anything for it. I'll tell racist jokes, if I think it'll make people laugh. I'll go on a tirade about how offensive racist humor is, if I think it'll make people respect me. I do nothing. Ive never done anything. The only things I ever consistently wanted in my life were to study at a prestigious university and to fall in love. There have been other dreams-- smaller ones, some which I've accomplished, most which I haven't-- but those two were the big ones. Well, the university thing isn't happening. I already went to college-- to a shit one, and got shit grades at it. And I'm too old and in too much debt to try to go back. They wouldn't want me even if I weren't in debt. I don't have anything I want to study in particular anyway. And I can't fall in love. I don't know why, but I just can't. I'm attractive enough, I think, and a young girl. I can make people laugh. I can talk to people and say all the right things, but no one is interested in me. Its like they can smell it on me.I keep trying. Every year it's the same thing: I destroy my life somehow (quit my job, alienate my friends, get drunk and make an ass of myself so badly I can't show my face around my old haunts anymore), and then I move somewhere even farther away, and I try again. Every time I've convinced myself that things will get better. I convince myself I'm making progress.Well, I just destroyed everything again. Or, rather, I'm on the edge of destroying it. I had a massive breakdown yesterday-- the whole works. Crying in public, screaming at strangers, texting everyone I ever knew to either tell them humiliating things about myself or to try and hurt their feelings, just to prove that I could. It happens every year, and is usually followed by me quitting and moving.  The only problem is, this time I have no where to go once its done. I'm already as far away as I can get, and I don't have the money or the resources to leave again. I have no where to go this time. Except, I realized, I can just kill myself. I have a plan. I have the tools for it too. They're sitting on a shelf next to my good luck charms and my old stuffed animal from when I was a kid. I have more than enough to do the trick. And I've already cleaned up my apartment and everything, threw away all the embarrassing things I wouldn't want anyone to see.I don't have a note. But I don't think I need a note. Maybe this is a note. I have these other sides of me that I project into actual people to talk to, because I'm lonely, and because it helps me think. It helps me sort out the responsible thoughts from the irresponsible ones. It helps me realize when I'm being vain, or selfish, or immature, because they're separate personifications. There's a new one now, that's been there since yesterday.It keeps telling me to do it. Anytime for the past 24 hours when I go to do anything, it's saying ""how about now"". It's telling me the logic behind it. It's telling me about how I've never really done anything in my life, just talked about it-- said how I'm going to be this or that one day, and then give it up later; pronounce how from today on I'm losing weight or I'm going to be an artist or I'm going to read more, but I never do. It's telling me that this is finally my chance to go through with something. I have a plan. And I have the materials. And I have the reasoning, and I'm trapped, and I have no where else to go.But I'm not an idiot. And I know that if you're suicidal-- really suicidal-- you're supposed to go to the hospital and tell them and they help you. But if I'm not really-- if this is just another time of me not doing anything, or doing something for attention, or some weird twisted way to get an extended vacation from work-- then I would be mortified to go there and have them find out that I'm not actually suicidal, just dramatic and vacuous and a waste of their time and energy. It looks like I'm close to it. I'm making it look like I'm very close to it. ","1"

"It's gotten way worse over the years, and I asked for it anywayI am for sure now that my depression has gotten worse. I experience emotional numbness unless I experience something extremely new. I jump at scares that never scared me before, maybe anxiety. I have misunderstandings about anxiety. It started around 6 or 8 months ago-I don't really remember. I remember failing my first academics test in my whole school career. It's not what caused it because I remember looking at that test and being okay with my mark. I'm not healthy, far from it. Around that incident, my sleep schedule went haywire. I kept studying- hoping I can catch up with my studies(because I didn't put any effort at all). Making schedules or excuses for myself that I can do this- I can study over the weekend and understand 3 chapters in 2 hours or some shit. I stopped having lunch my mother made for me, then I stopped having breakfast. Summer school comes over and I improve because I love summer school for advanced courses. New school year comes in and now It's been 3 months in. I tell false promises and goals. I procrastinate because I REALLY do not want to do my work. I sometimes stop eating dinner. I do exercise because I am on a sports team. I barely sleep anymore not because of insomnia, but because I have ""work"" to do that I should have finished during the day. I get shivers almost every day, and when I eat too much I vomit. It's not that I hate my lifestyle, but I don't mind it either. I think I like it-maybe because I deserve it? Or that I asked for it? I don't know, I know I don't but I continue to put myself in this position. I eat more junk food(chips) then I should and I absolutely hate it, makes me sick but for some reason, I keep eating it. I can't eat too much or else I feel like absolute shit. I love fruits and veggies because it tastes so good and healthy, I swear I can smell lettuce a few feet away from me. But I don't eat it? I don't understand. I cant have caffeine pills anymore because of my caffeine overdose a few weeks ago, even if the bottle is right there... I'm not fat, I'm not skinny either and my weight does lose or gain 5-10 pounds repeatedly. What I do hate the most about is my eyes, my eyes always feel like absolute shit, I have to close them because they feel heavy or tight and they're the reason I took caffeine pills because my eyes would feel lifted. Caffeine hurts me more and doesn't make my eyes feel light anymore, so that's why I don't take them anymore. I barely have water because I think I drink too much in a matter of minutes (24oz in seconds) at a time. Water makes me sick and cold, I hate it. What I think is the worse is that I love feeling clean, clean room and clean body, but now I just don't give any shit, my mouth always taste bad so I continue to wash it. I realize my cognitive skills and my brain is worse off and probably permanently damaged due to this. I sometimes get these split-second dizzy spells or I feel spaced out. I don't think I can return being that person I was a year ago, I was clever and I always had these ""clicks"" that would make me understand something completely in minutes. I think its still there but I just can't feel it anymore.My family doesn't make this any easier despite their support and good intentions. They make things worse for me and I want to move out when I am old enough. They are more of a hindrance than help.TL:DR + ConclusionI'm worse off and I know partly why and I know how to fix it with a better lifestyle. I, however, will not put any effort into my life anymore. I still keep going through. But for the sake of my life even if I am scared that a car doesn't slow down when I cross the street but then slows down immediately I will not put effort into improving. It's not that I hate it or I mind it, it feels something I just do just for the sake of doing. I don't know, and I don't know why I am saying this on Reddit, I don't know if its a call for help or I just need to be set straight. I know what I have to do to get better but I just won't do it. I will also continue to keep doing this until... I don't know.I'm am open to feedback, or ridicule, or something else- I don't care and I don't know. I know I sound like an arrogant and ignorant jackass. I feel like calling for help, but every time ""help"" comes it's more of a hindrance than help or it's not there.","1"

"Hi Everyone, Im from Australia and I caused someones death. I never really liked this person to begin with. We were acquaintances and talked a few times every few months when a circle of friends met up. He plagiarised at the university he attends and being the person I am I reported him to the university and show them the evidence (dont ask me how I got the evidence I just did). He plagiarised multiple times. He has done a few things to me which caused me to take action against him (really wish I didnt).Few days later I found out he was expelled from the university. I was happy this was the outcome( although I did not know the consequence will be that severe, I expected a warning) More days come after he figured out it was me and some of his friends lashed out at me. I believe what I did was right anyway. You dont get anywhere in life by cheating. 2 days after I found out he killed himself. I was shell shocked. I was devastated. I been feeling extremely guilty and every time I think about this it makes me stomach feel sick. I been so devestated. Although I never liked him I would never wanted him to kill himself. Some of my friends said I did the right thing and his death wasnt my fault but I feel 100% at fault. Any words of advice will be welcome on how to feel less guilty will be great. Would I also be charged with his death? One of his friends messaged me and said hes reporting me to the police for what I did.","1"

"Hi, guys. It's 2:00 a.m.I can't go to bed. I'm holding back tears and typing slowly so my family doesn't wake up. I'm tired of all this shit and I just wanna let go and float off into the cold, icy water like Jack on Titanic. I just want to close my eyes, let go, and fly to wherever I'm headed. It's been a full week and a day since I had a massive mental, nervous breakdown at work. I was a Cashier, as usual, working for my 11.50 an hour, when I started to feel depressed. (It happens a lot, I have Bipolar Disorder and have for four years now) Then, a customer came up who wanted his chicken discounted, and when I wouldn't, he reported me to my manager for being rude. Normally, I'm fine with that; it happens all the time with jerks or assholes. Some people just wanna watch what happens if they report us. But this time, with my life in its present situation, I broke down shaking, crying in my blue vest, on the concrete with my manager watching with this now horrified man as I devolved into a husk. I've had a nervous breakdown a year ago, and it was worse than this, but this one still kills me. They sent me home, and I took four days off. Still, now, I am doing okay - but that's it. I've been there eight months and am the longest cashier to stay there by far. I've trained literally everyone on my level and watched them all leave, one by one. What caused my breakdown (it's been building for two months) was the death of two of my relatives, my job being threatened twice over sales, my physical health worsening and my family life declining, as well as my friendships. My dad is worried that I'm gonna kill myself because I find no pleasure in anything, even eating anymore. I ate a box of lucky charms all of today, and I have been sleepless for four days now. I feel scared and hopeless. I'm afraid if I quit my job I won't be able to find another one or a good one at that, and that I'll be a failure. I don't even recognize the man in the mirror anymore. I feel like a husk of a human. I'm 19 and ready to die if I got the chance. ","1"

I work fulltime and have no friends/social life. Everytime I leave the house and see happy couples together it hits me like a punch in the stomach and makes me feel so pathetic and useless. I don't have the looks or personality for a girlfirend so I don't need any advice in that department, I just need a reason or a will to keep going. I fear that I'm gonna do something spontaneous like jump in front of a train or something but I would hate to put my parents through the misery. Need advice on how to distract myself for the time being.","1"
"There is nowhere to go- down or up. I am stuck in this basket of unsettlement. The only thing keeping me from ending it is the feelings of the people I love, and the fact that a failed attempt would just suck. I have always prided myself on my school work, if nothing else, before this year. But things have changed because I am no longer the smartest in any of my classes. I just look like someone who tries too hard now. There is so much competition. People are making scores that I can only dream about left and right. There is no hope. Why keep going?","1"
"They said, ""You're not depressed."" ""Stop talking nonsense.""And they saw my cuts a few months ago.They said I can't be depressed because I never experienced to become financially unstable, because I have a nice home and I get to eat anything.I feel so invalidated, like there's a requirement to be depressed.Just because I don't suffer as much as what they suffered financially before doesn't make me have no right to be depressed.

Why do you think you deserve that? Your parents treated you like garbage because that's what you are. Just do the world a favor and get hit by a train.","1"
"Crosspost from r/depression because idk where they want it, plus some bonus suicide stuff.I'm 19 and I still can't drive. Got the permit and practiced but failed twice and lost the motivation, or rather I channelled what limited motivation I had into more basic tasks like waking up every day.Never had any sort of job. Terrified of applying and interviewing.Horrible social anxiety that only gets better when my depression gets bad enough to numb it. I was out to eat recently with my family and the stress of ordering my food crushed my mood and my appetite. Like, Jesus fucking Christ, ordering a goddamn burrito?? Broke down and talked to my parent once, and got taken to see a doctor. Got a Zoloft prescription and saw an unhelpful therapist a few times before quitting. The stress of doctors got to me and I lied my way through it and said the pills were working fine. I never felt any different. Eventually saw a different doctor and got switched to Lexapro, but I did the same thing as before. The multiple check-ins drained me and I just wanted to suffer alone. As a young kid in school I was always told I was smart, one of the brightest, I could go far with my brain. But I'm so lazy, and tired. I nearly flunked senior year in highschool, I'm failing my first semester of college because I'm a laxy piece of shit who doesn't do their work, and definitely losing the scholarship that got me there. Gotta talk to my parent. I live with them but they don't know. Gotta tell them I'm quitting. Didn't know what I wanted to do anyway.I feel like I've failed both society's and my own expectations for myself, and I can never catch up, I fucked it all up. I'm ashamed, I'm going to be ashamed forever. I don't believe I'll ever be a functional adult.I feel like I don't know myself. Have you ever taken a personality test? I'm so indecisive, each question is like torture. I don't really have hobbies, I procrastinate on the internet like a Reddit junkie and I sleep. I fucking love sleeping. And I get into arguments with myself. It always ends with I don't know, I don't know, I don't know.I'm miserable but I'm too scared, and too tired to kill myself, but I don't know how to feel like life is worth living. The desire to die is just a constant running thought in my mind, and when it's not at the forefront it's still there, ready to jump in as soon as I'm not distracted by something else. If I had the access and freedom to kill myself with an inert gas I probably would, but I can't get the materials.","1"
"I use this account as a way for me to be completely honest, even if it means I'm extremely hurtful to others. I'm not a bad person per se, but I do this anyway. And I've been banned from several subs. You can see why based on my previous comments.I'm emotionally detached. And most of my relationships are based solely on logic rather than emotions. Even my relationship with my current gf is actually structured around a contractual obligation rather than love. Been together for a couple years now.However...I realize that this is due to my own steadily declining mental health and I'm quickly coming to a severe breakdown. I honestly think, as soon as it happens, I'm gonna end this. Just need to take care of things so as to not be a burden on my family when I'm gone.","1"
"My girlfriend died from suicide 4 weeks ago today.  Each day has become more difficult not to want to kill myself.  I am going to therapy, breavment groups, talking to friends, but nothing is helping.  I received a letter today from a coworker who's worried about me.  It was beautifully written, containing praise, hope, and even a personal antidote of relatability, as her partner died from suicide nearly 8 years ago.  However, instead of the effect it should have had in making me feel more apart of, loved, and cared for, it made me want to die right then and there.  I just don't see a point in living when the love of my life, my soul mate is gone.  I know myself well enough and I am not naturally geared towards suicidal thoughts, that this is how I feel.  I simply do not want to go thru this life without my partner.  I am trying to hang on because I have children and my father does depend on me.   And while I may endure for sometime for them, I feel as though I am already gone.  I know no one can tell me how long is enough and this decesion is mine...and I don't want anyone experiencing the pain I am as a result of me killing myself, but I do not see it as a selfish act.  I understand my mind and thoughts may appear off to some, but I've always felt I wanted to die within a short time of my soulmate.  I just never expected it to be this early in life.  I honestly dont know if i am going to do it tonight, tomoorow, next week, or never.  Its a moment to moment struggle right now.  But generally speaking, i feel as thiugh im fighting a losing battle.  Any thoughts?","1"
"I know people say you're supposed to get over the failure. But, I can't. I've seen the Kobe Bryant video where he talks about how repeating the same mistakes is failure. And, I realize that I'm a failure. I keep repeating the same mistakes. Term after term. I never thought I would turn into this person. And yet, outside of college, I'm fine. I genuinely regret going to college. I wish I had taken a year off before college and tried things. I wish I had tried a job like this before college. On the other hand, I read about automation and how low skilled jobs are going to be lost. So, maybe I should suck it up and get that stupid degree to give myself a bit of an edge. I always start the term thinking that things would be hard. That assignments would be hard. That I would struggle. Then, the end of the term comes and I regret making things harder than they needed to be. I realize that I could have taken small easy steps every day to put myself in a better position at the end. But, I keep forgetting that epiphany. I should call it my most forgettable epiphany. I feel like that mythological guy that kept pushing the rock up the mountain. I'm just tired. I have grown in so many ways. But, I seem to have forgotten how to study. Goddamn that bitch who failed me that first class. She ruined my life. She pushed the first domino. I'm not going to commit suicide, but I'm not going to live either.","1"

"I spent about 20-30 mins just scrolling through /r/SuicideBereavement seeing how people react and deal with the grief of the suicide of a close loved one. And I don't think I can bring this pain to them but I can't deal with my own pain. I don't know what to do anymore. I remember when I was 9 - 10 I was the most social kid in school and I got along with everybody. Then I got depressed when I was 11 and tried to hang myself that same age. I don't know what to think anymore. ","1"
"15, I've posted a lot but now I feel worse than I have ever, my brother told me at dinner two days ago that I had no idea how to have a conversation and that made me feel so weird and stupid. I can't do anything remotely normal in life like today I almost stepped onto the road but a car was coming so I said sorry under me breath, who does that? I can't do anything I did a part time job at my dads place and someone asked me if they taught me anything at all and someone printed a list of instructions out for me even though I knew what I was doing and they didn't do this to anyone else. All throughout school I've been mocked by teachers, friends, classmates and sometimes some family members take jabs at me, my aunt called me ""the funniest girl"" and not in a laughing with you way a while ago and it really stuck with me. I feel so ugly and disgusting all the time, I feel like an alien who has no idea how to do anything. I was watching a random review video when I was bored and someone in the video was calling someone ""bonkers"" and a ""weirdo"" and it really panicked me because I know people talk about me like that behind my back, I have a strange addiction I can't talk about because I'm too embarrassed writing this is really hard, it has to do with a mental disorder that doesn't really have study done on it at all so I have become my community's crazy person. I have zero hope for the future I really think my early childhood was the best time of my life. A few people have jumped in front of trains at my local train station in the last few months and I think I'll be the next one, I just hope it's quick and easy. But I'm terrified I'll go to hell (I know I'm crazy sorry) genuinely I'm terrified it's real and I'll go there that and the sadness I'll put on my family are the only reasons I'm still here.","1"

Sometimes i get my mind to think about something else, but i always go back to how much i hate myself, or how lonely i am and how i want to feel love again. I feel like im in constant pain every day. Trapped inside the monster that is my own mind.I told my friend about some of my issues. He is supportive but i dont think it is enough. Nobody can understand what it is like to be trapped inside my horrible warped mind. I am such a fucking loser and need to end this pain. I tried twice this week. I tried last week but stopped taking pills because i got too scared. I downed the rest of the bottle before bed a few days ago after drinking. all they did was give me a stomach ache and threw up in the morning =( I tried to jump the day after but broke down on the bridge and walked home.I cant even die properly. Nothing ever goes fucking right for me and i just want my pain to end. I want to be loved and for the prison that is my mind to stop yelling at me all day.

Does anybody else think about ending it all day like me?My friends dont know how bad my pain is =( they cant possibly understand.","1"
"I'm not a dumb guy, but I know people who are geniuses. I've met people who can teach themselves languages in just a week or two. I have friends going to Princeton and Berkeley. I've met talented musicians, talented speakers, talented mathematicians. I'm not a very worldly guy, these are just people I've met at school or work. I get that they probably have their own problems that they struggle with, but everyone has problems, so why shouldn't I want to be talented and have problems rather than be normal and have problems? If there are so many talented people just in my little corner of the world, there are probably just as many in every other city. I just feel out competed. There are too many people smarter or generally more talented than me. My place in the world is probably in a cubicle farm. At best, I might manage a cubicle farm, but anything more than that and I'll just be out competed by one of the many people so much smarter than I am. The problem is that I don't want to manage a cubicle farm. Ironically I've always been very competitive, and also very bad at winning anything. The only time I'm happy is when I'm at the top. If I'm the funniest person in the room or the smartest person in the class, then I feel alright, but watching people better than me get attention honestly kills me. I want to be the Bob Dylan, or the Julius Caesar, or the Elon Musk. The reality is that I'm nowhere near competant enough to become any kind of notable figure. If I had the kind of drive those people had, then I would be out in the world creating something right now instead of writing a reddit post. I think about killing myself every day. I don't think that this problem is relatable in any way. In reality, I'm just a baby who wants everything to be handed to them without putting in any effort. I don't work hard for anything. When I see something I want I don't become filled with some energy and purpose to get it, I just feel bad and pathetic because someone else got there before me. I'm sick of just floating through life, taking the easiest possible route, but I certainly don't have the willpower to make any real change in my life. I just hate myself.","1"

"Huge argument today with my brother (background is we were both abused as children, fyi). We have these every so often. He says horrible things to me, but I'm always the one to instigate it due to our messed up childhood. He called me evil and an animal. Thing is, he's right. I am an animal. I was wondering recently what makes us human (or a human animal, if you prefer). Certain birds and even bears can count. Ants and other creatures create ""cities"". Some animals use tools, and other primates may even be spiritual (https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/03/chimpanzee-spirituality/475731/).Do we have souls and animals don't? No one knows. So, I think, what makes us human? Each other. I've been outcast from that. I've been treated like a non-human because I can't act like a human animal. Am I evil? Possibly. I don't know. I haven't done Hitler level shit but you don't have to be a dictator to mess people's lives up, and I'm pretty sure I'm carrying on my father's legacy of being an asshole. My brother said suicide is selfish, and that I'm always playing victim. Maybe I am. Maybe after decades of abuse I don't know how to be anything else. I own up to what I do, however, but that's not going to save me. Suicide is not selfish. It's desperation. If my brother could feel how literally heavy I feel in my heart he might understand. There's no saving some people, and I think I'm one of them.If God is just, I will go to hell. If God is merciful, I won't. I don't know if you believe in hell. Maybe there is just nothing. Maybe it's like a long sleep. I had a blind spot once from a migraine. There was nothing there. No light, no dark, just nothing. I don't know how to explain it. Maybe that's what death is like.But if hell is real, I deserve it.  ","1"

"I don't know if this is the right place to go, but I'm not too sure where to turn. I just spoke to one of my best friends who has just split up with his girlfriend after roughly 4 years (the first serious one of his life). We're both pretty young (17 y/os) so not only does he have little experience with this sort of pain, but I have little experience with dealing with helping him out in this case.He's considering committing suicide (I know he considered committing suicide before he had this girlfriend). He also told me that his grandmother (who he is very close to) may have lung cancer, which is also causing further distress to him. He told me he wanted to get out of the country and just get away from everything. I tried to assure him that life would look better in the future, but I'm really not sure what to do.

"I had just finished college and bought my first car last June. It cost all of my money. It was a great car for its price and could have lasted me years. I was in a minor accident a mere two weeks after getting it, but it was only 50 worth of damage so I got off easy. I got a job working minimum wage in a call center for insurance the same month. Its an ok job but the money is mere peanuts for the labor of having to listen to people shout at me all day. I'm currently back living with my parents after college in a rural village and don't have many friends. All of them are either living back in Galway where I went to college or have moved to England or Canada. My life is basically get up, go to work, go home, spend the rest of my day on my laptop, sleep. A pretty dull life but my plan was to build up money, get my own place and find a good job with my software degree down in Dublin. However since last month, thinks started to take a turn for the worst. I was told I may not pass probation and will be let go by December because of my call quality. My alcoholic brother tried to choke me to death and I refuse to speak to him anymore. And to top it all off, I totaled my new car yesterday after skidding on black ice and rolled down a hill into a farmers field, destroying his gate and fencing. I came out unharmed but felt like a total idiot as I downright refused to learn my lesson about speeding last time. Now I have no car, the one thing I had, barely any money to buy a new one, have to pay for the damage to the farmers property, and I am in the process of losing my crappy job should I not pass probation. I am literally going nowhere in life. I feel it has no purpose. I barely speak to my friends, only my parents. My mother (despite good intentions) treats me like a child and my father always just berates me on what I should and shouldn't do. I just wish I died in that car accident and stopped being a burden to both them and the world.","1"
"I'm done. I'm done lying to myself, it won't get better, I won't find someone, even if by some miracle I'll wind up pushing them away. Why keep going if everything I have has slipped (or is slipping) away. The band is dead, we haven't even practiced with everyone since August. I haven't heard anything from either of the other guys since September. It's not like we had everything going for us anyways. We are just three ugly teens that tried to make music. I have no future right now. Three D-'s one F. The only class I have a good grade in is guitar. Even then I suck at it.  The only thing that I can see in my future if I stick around is working at McDonald's for the rest of my shitty ass fucking life.I wish I could disappear, just simply go somewhere and never return. I'm probably going to make it look like an accident when I do it. If I didn't I would just become another rumor. I'm going to be forgotten just like the other guys from the school. I'm go to end up like Steve, Kadin, and Nathan (all committed suicide and are pretty much forgotten about). Just be everyone's best friend for a day then be forgotten. It's better than just being forgotten here while I'm alive . It's funny how only the popular guys got remembered if they died. Everyone remember's Max (the star basketball player who committed suicide) and Clay (a popular guy who wrapped his car around a tree). Everyone went to their candlelight vigils. I kind of want one, but who would show up? I'd want Highly Suspect (especially Serotonia), Down, Black Sabbath, Metallica, some Judas Priest, and Pantera to play at it or my funeral.

"This is a sincere request for help to gather the courage to finally end my journey. The longer I am around, the more debts I rack up, the more pain I cause to those around me, and the longer I prolong the inevitable. The people in my life know I will end my life at some point, as do I, and I wish us all to experience the relief of having it over and done with.All I need is to get my dog to the shelter when it opens in 4 hours (they will call my next of kin when I don't return to pick her up), and then get myself to the location I've chosen which is a 5 hour drive from here. What would you tell someone to get them to stop postponing and get on with it? How do you get over that foolish fear when you know this is the right decision?I'm not asking for hatemongers to haze me into hating myself enough to kill myself, I'm asking for respectful feedback on how to help me achieve the only goal I have in my life and to follow through on my sincere desire to be done. I don't know why I can't seem to take this last step and I know how much pain I am keeping everyone, myself included, in purgatory.Thank you in advance to those who wish me well and will want to encourage me to stay alive to keep fighting.

"I don't know why I still hold on. I want to die so badly but I can't push myself to do it. My anxiety always stops me, yet I know when I'm gone, no one will care. I have everything planned yet I can't go through with it. Im running out of people to turn to when I'm feeling like this (which is 75% of the day). I doubt even the person I have a crush on would care. In fact, I'm sure people would be happy to see me go. I don't belong here, I shouldn't have been born. I have no purpose, people just waste time when talking to me. We're all gonna be dead someday anyway so why cant I just end it now so all my pain and suffering will go away. The few friends I have might care for a day or two then forget about me. My family might be sad for a week max then they'll also forget about me. Everyone else in my life, they'll probably just act like I never existed. Everyone except a few people in my life hate me, they wouldn't care if I died. I just don't care anymore, but if I'm going to kill myself then I'm going to do something big before it, unless I make my death look like an accident. If I make it look like an accident then no one will blame themselves. I could also go ""missing"". I have all three of those scenarios planned out.

"You don't know me. I haven't posted in here before. I found this sub while searching for a new method, and I just felt like I should post. I needed a place I could talk openly without someone calling an ambulance on me, and I'm hoping this is it.I don't really know where to start. I'm 29 and female. I've dealt with depression, OCD, and a mood disorder for just about all of my life, and PTSD for half of it. I have a failed marriage and an okay job that I don't really see as a long-term career. I have a number of suicide attempts in my history, including 3 in the last 2 years. I was going to end it last night, but I got drunk and fell asleep instead. I've taken all the recommended steps today. I'm taking my meds, I talked to my therapist, I practiced my DBT skills, I chatted with a crisis hotline. I can't go to a hospital because of hospital-related trauma. Going in to a psych ward always makes it worse for me. I self-harm while I'm in and I'm still suicidal when I get out. Nothing is helping, though.I know why I shouldn't do it, but I feel like I need to. Things just seem to hit a new low after every time I try to die, and I try to overcome the new circumstances, but I can't. Everyone is now telling me how great they think I'm doing, and I feel like it needs to be now, before anybody suspects it. I'm like, stable right now. I'm paying my bills, getting decent grades, and holding down my responsibilities. They all think I'm just too emotional, so I need to do it during a time of stability so they understand how much the pain permeates my life. I need to do it now before the shit hits the fan again.

"For three years, while living in a homeless shelter which was a container project, I suffered with flu nearly every day, unbearable anxiety and depression along with a ready made ghetto full of rape, crack and suicide.It would be impossible to describe the physical and mental suffering endured during this time. I saw dozens of doctors and clinics, nobody can figure out what is wrong. I suffer from severe fevere like symptoms daily and live in almost permanent hell. I have to physically purge my system of cortisol and adrenaline multiple times in the day. My dissociative symptoms are so extreme sometimes I have no idea what is going and suffer amnesia like symptoms. I have profound insomnia that I am due to see a sleep clinic for, a neurologist for my fevers and will be starting a third lit of CBT this year.Today I received a letter from the DWP in the UK stating that my money will be reduced to 60 a week down from 125 for some reason I have been placed in the work related group instead of the support group.I had an assessment 4 months ago and provided evidence of my inability to work and how I have been MUCH more ill that the last two years of where I was receiving the normal rate. The appeal process takes weeks and I won't be getting any money in that time.The only thing stopping me killing myself this very minute is the though of hurting my grandmother, who is 96 and I live with all the heart I have and my mother who has had an awful life as well. The only reason I was alive was because I could buy the food and warmth I needed. I can't even buy my family presents for Christmas now.I want to die so badly and I'm scared that that feeling might overtake the love of my family and I might kill myself.

I've been feeling this way since I was about 12, I am now 17. I feel like I should see a therapist or something but at the same time I don't. I have such horrible thoughts and want to kill myself but then I catch myself and say I don't want to because I'm normal. I don't understand myself. I want to die. I want to commit suicide and I hate living. I cry everyday because I am alive and how much I hate myself and my life. I find no joy in anything. I go crazy and punch myself, hit myself with objects but then again I say I am not crazy. I see how crazy I get but I don't get the help I need. I mean at least meds will help me but I don't want it to go on my record. I don't want to lose a job because I have a mental illness.Am I stupid for going undiagnosed and not getting help? I cut myself, I bruise myself, I make myself throw up, I binge eat. I have problems but I don't want anyone to know. Why can't I be normal. I want to be normal again.","1"
"I was battling deppresion for several years and I somehow won. It only costed me my desires, my dreams, and some of my blood.Now Im 19. I just failed university but my future still looks quite promising, I could get an above average job and if I work on myself I have a chance to get a really well paid job in just a few years. I dont have a problem to make friends or lead interesting conversations even in a group of people. I consider myself under-average in terms of look but some girls in my life told me Im hot and I often found random girls watching me.So my life is easy and there is not much to worry about, right ??Not really, I'm asexual and I don't want to be with someone nor to have a family ever, I'm introverted and even though many told me Im good at talking and listening to people, I do not enjoy it at all.I'm disguisted by society and all those false values it holds. And I feel like there is nothing life has to offer. I have nothing and yet I have all I could've ever wanted. It makes me somewhat happy but it also makes me ready to leave this world in peace. Which is what Im considering right now.Edit: I forgot the question:""What makes you stay ??""","1"

"I'm totally at a loss and don't know what to do. A short back story, So in my little trio of friends the other two we will call Don and Allie. Basically we've all been real good friends for the past 3-4 years and last year Don got a thing for Allie and they were dating for about 3 months when Allie broke things off because she didn't feel anything for Don and didn't want to waste his time.Then they decided that they would take a month and figure it out on if Allie wanted to try again or not. role around to last week Allie said no, she didn't want to be with Don.Now a bit further back I revealed to The both of them my notebook where I write down all my thoughts to get them out as a bit of therapy for myself and all that I'm dealing with. I learned then today that Don made his own notebook and gave it to Allie to try and communicate what he was going through. But Allie came up to me today and told me that He had written a whole bunch of stuff about how he loves her and all that and how pissed he would be if she said no because of another guy. but then she told me about a part where he wrote about wanting to commit suicide about ""Just wanting to put a gun up to your temple and feel the bullet go through your skull and fade into the white."" I've noticed also these past few days he hasn't been his normal self. And he texted me today telling me he wanted to talk face to face to me tomorrow without Allie around. I'm scared, I'm scared for him, I'm scared for what he might do.I don't know what to do. He's my best friend and Allie already had one close friend commit suicide earlier this year. And if he dose I don't know what I would do. Basically I need help for tomorrow what can I tell him to make him not want to go. I don't care about grammar and proper structure in this post I just need help.","1"

"ive been suicidal for the past 5 years due to many different reasons alchoholism and a long histroy of drugs in my family it just makes me think why does it have to be me and makes me think its me because i dont belong on this earth i dont fit in anywhere and i never will which is why i am suicidal but this year has been really hard and i was bout to end it all but my mom came home and i didn't go through with it i told my therapist and was sent onto a suicide prevention therapy place and at first everyone seemed to be so shocked and everyone promised things will change and it actually made me hopeful and fast forward 2 weeks and its all right back to the same old shit absolutely nothing has changed and its like it never happened i dont want to die but it makes me think what more can i do to give them a wakeup call? some nights when im in a good mood listening to music i just think id be happy to die right now im afraid it seems like the only way things will change is if i die","1"

"Something is holding me back. I'm very young and I'm literally just starting into an adult life but I've lost motivation for anything. I feel extremely alone, but I know there are people that would be hurt, and most that I know would just be confused (a large majority of my friends are online friends that don't know me irl, so they wouldn't be informed of anything that happened unless I specifically told them what I was doing.) Yet I still feel extremely alone, even if I talk to people. At the moment, I am/was best friends with somebody, who I told everything, including how lost I feel in life. Just recently they stopped asking what was wrong. They got tired of me, like everyone else seems to do.They didn't necessarily stop talking to me but I can tell the extreme difference between what we were and what we are now. And I fucking hate it. I rarely, RARELY go out, I have severe anxiety talking to people, and I'm a fucking failure at social skills. I hate myself as a person, and I rarely leave my house, or my room. I'm separated from my family too, they know nothing about me personality wise anymore. And I really don't know about my future. I don't know what to do and I'm only living for others because they don't want me to die, not because I want to live. I haven't wanted to be alive for years. i don't know what to do with myself.

"This is going to be long. Sorry. I am struggling so much right now. I don't have anything or anyone,  and am invisible to my friends and my peers. I am in unspeakable pain which no one sees. No one wants to see it, no one could handle seeing it, and no one will try to see it. If you're reading this, you must have super-vision, because these are the invisible words of an invisible human.I am a survivor of child torture, child sex trafficking, multiple attempted murders, and severe abuse/neglect. I pulled myself up out of it as soon as I was old enough to leave, and somehow I've become a 'success'. I'm high-functioning  I have achieved a lot since getting free, and can put on a face to stave off causing people alarm.I just can no longer keep going. There are no resources for me. There is no one who can relate to me. Therapists don't know how to handle someone with my trauma history. There is no one who cares. I'm the wrong demographic for torture survivors, so hell, there isn't even a listicle or a nice supportive website to help me learn about my trauma. I think all of the time how much I wish one of those attempted murders had been successful: I'd not be in pain. I wouldn't exist. I don't want to exist. I have attempted suicide so many times. I've lost count. All were serious attempts. Each time I get a bit better at how to do it. Most of the time, I get tired and sleepy (attempting suicide is traumatic, and one symptom of dissociation is sleepiness), and that exhaustion has thwarted my suicide attempts multiple times.If you've not survived extreme trauma or torture, you have no idea what kind of pain and loneliness lies in its aftermath. I need to detail the ways. I need to be heard to the 'internet'. After all, no friends or family can/will hear. Torture hurts you physically, obviously. But its one thing to live through it -- after your torturers have left, there is more torture your own body will inflict on you. First, the scars. The reminders. 'Hey, they tried to kill you here'. 'Hey, they tried to make you scream here'. 'Hey, you were so helpless here.' Then, in sex trafficking, there are the diseases your therapist urges you to get tested for. Only you can't work up the nerve to go to the doctor because you are so afraid  of being assaulted again. Then, you finally get brave, only you have to go alone. A nurse you don't know holds your hand. Agonizing days of waiting for results. I got lucky: my traffickers wanted a clean product, so I don't have any diseases. But you can't tell your average friends and colleagues, 'Hey, I was raped many hundreds of times by people I never met, and look, I don't have HIV.'Torture injures your mind. My god it destroys your mind. It goes beyond normal PTSD. PTSD from torture brings you close to psychosis, or so my therapist tells me. The hallucinations, the somatic re-experiencing, the nightmares -- those are so much worse. Anything sets me off: some guy who reminds me of a 'client' in my class, someone slams a door, someone raises their hands, someone's nose flares. Hyper-sensitive to any kind of anger, I am afraid of body language. Alongside the flashbacks are the emotions that happened when you  were being tortured, out of place, with no context. Torture destroys your health. Most days I am not in my body enough to feel it. You can't afford to feel your body in torture - what no one tells you is that you don't always get the feeling back. It destroys your ability to connect with people: you project your torturers' intentions onto everyone. Your good friend might rape you at any minute. Your boss might hit you. What someone pulls out of their pocket might be the stun-gun that they used on you. One flash of irritation and your life is threatened. There's the pistol in front of your face -- when the motorcycle drives by and it makes that 'pop' sound that the pistol makes when they fire an empty round at your eyes. One ignored message, and you're back alone in that dark locked room, unable to eat, sleep, use the restroom, cry, speak, scream, or anything else - if you do, they'd kill you. I wasn't even ten years old - this has become my identity.Torture makes you alone. No one you know can relate to you. Just telling your story makes people need therapy. You are a walking mental infection -- torture is all you know because you were so young when it happened, that WHO you are is a crazy-making machine. 'Just be yourself'. If I were myself, I'd drive people insane. I am not myself and I already push everyone away. People are 'well-intentioned,' but 'we can't talk right now; I can't deal with your pain. It is too much for me'. What can you say to that? You can't demand someone see your pain. No one should see that kind of pain.I don't know what love feels like. I have never had someone in my life show me love, except for two people, and one of them died. I was so traumatized when they loved me that I couldn't feel it. Because I push people away, I doubt I will ever feel what it is like to be loved. I certainly don't feel safe enough to allow myself to feel emotions for myself.So, all this to say, this is my reality. This is why I want to die. This is why I am fighting the impulse to go attempt it again for the n-th time by writing this piece of shit here, which no one will read. No one can tell me it will get better -- no one can know that. The title of this post is 'I can't relive the torture anymore.' Last night I fell asleep to the image of the man who used to torture me seared into my brain. He'd come in and put the stun gun on my body and hold it there...over and over and over. I fell asleep to that nightmare last night. I have that flashback every night, and have had it for eight months now. I hallucinate the feeling of the shock in my body. I scream every night 'please, stop, I'm sorry, I'll be good, I won't do it again' only to see him smile and put the stun gun in another location. I imagine someone there comforting me.I am so alone that I have to self-soothe to get through every night. I've learned to imagine someone there holding my hand while he rapes and shocks me. No one should have to live like this.I want to die. I'm so tired. I'm so ready. I need to rest from this pain. I'm 'young' and have my whole life ahead of me, they say. Fuck that. I've lived multiple lifetimes' worth of pain. I just want to stop existing. I can't handle seeing his face one more night. ","1"
"I used to believe I was a good person. Well, ok, not ""good"", but I knew there were worse people than me. Overall, I've never really been a good person. I am quite possibly the embodiment of all 7 of the deadly sins. I am fat, lazy as all hell, when i'm not treating myself like shit i'm bragging about how great I am, I get angry and take it out on other people, I act like a horny teenager all the time (granted I am 16, but that doesn't matter in the grand scheme of things), and I just am an overall waste of human matter. The only reason I haven't killed myself is because I fear hurting those I car about. But people have shown me several times that 1) they don't care about me and 2) I am hurting them more by living. But that isn't even the reason I am contemplating suicide again, for the 3rd time in my life. The reason I want to kill myself is to get revenge on my mother. My mom is an abusive woman. I won't go into details and drag on too long, but she is a terrible person. She is narcissistic, hypocritical, abusive, cruel, and unjust. I have attempted several times to reason with her, and even have physically fought with her, but nothing ever changes. Nothing will change. But, if I kill myself and use my death to guilt her, she will change, and I will be free from this burden of a life I have. (Note: I am not going to go through with this yet, I just wanted to know if I am a terrible person for thinking this, or if my depression is just getting the best of me again.)","1"

Even today she told me she doesn't know if she will come tommorow, because she might be gone. I am suicidal too, but I won't do it because of personal reasons, she hovewer seems very serious. I'm so scared that one day I will come to school and hear ""[Her name] is in hospital after suicide attempt"" or worse... I don't even want to think about it. Talking with her therapist doesn't help her, meds don't help her. She told me I can't do anything to help her if even this things don't help her. The thing is, the burden of trying to keep someone dear to me alive is too much for me. My depression and other problems are too much and adding hers... I am exhausted, confused, helpless... I can't sleep at night even on my meds. I can't just tell her ""hey, your problems are too much for me, could you stop?"". Even now I'm afraid that any minute she would write to me ""I will kill myself today"" and I couldn't tell her anything I didn't already told her and she will this time really do it... It makes me suicidal and this pain, this responsibility is too much for me. I don't know what to do. I don't know how to help her and myself. ","1"
"To preface all of this, I've struggled with ADHD, OCD, and MDD my whole life. I never had structure of guidance on how to manage myself and follow through. I feel like I've faked my way through everything, and when I do try to seriously put effort in, I end up spinning my wheels and often failing worse. I'm currently going to a very expensive college, and I feel like I don't deserve to be there. I don't feel smart enough or capable enough, and I've been really struggling since I got here, and I'm in my senior year now and nothing is better and I can't do anything and none of my professors believe in me anymore and they all look at me like they don't want me to be there or like I'm an annoyance. They treat me as if I'm unreliable, which makes me panic and spiral and then I AM unreliable and I make everything worse. I feel like all the negative things people say about me are true. I feel like I can't do anything right. I've tried really hard to get better, but nothing ever sticks. I've been in therapy and taken medications and gotten an ADHD coach and I still can't do anything for myself. When I was barely scraping by and passing my classes I tried to push through, but now I've failed two classes and I just don't know if I have it in me to try again.  I know failing isn't horrible, but it proved to me that I haven't improved at all and that I am totally and completely hopeless. I failed the same class twice after the professors bent over backwards to help me and the class wasn't even difficult to begin with. If I fail again I'm going to be kicked out, and I feel so guilty that my parents have wasted money on my education and trying to get me help when I'm just a helpless idiot who can't do anything. I know people let care about me, and I know it will hurt them, but I don't know how I'm going to ever be able to function on my own and I don't want my parents or friends to waste any more time or money or effort on me when everything up until this point hasn't worked. I just feel so guilty and I hate myself for messing up so badly when all my parents have done is support me and try to give me the opportunity to succeed. I wish I could just flip a switch and have it all be over, but I know that if I tried to kill myself I'd just fuck that up too and then make even more problems for my family and cost them even more money. Im terrified how they'll react when they find out I've failed. I'm terrified of going back to school. I'm terrified of the future. I really don't know what to do. I feel like I'm trapped in my own head.","1"

Always been a mopey kid, always shut myself off emotionally and from the people around me, always pushed people away, always been lazy, etc etc. Maybe I should just suck it up and shut up.Whatever. I'll be dead in the next couple of years. If I make it through college (if I even get into any) I'll be very surprised. Here's to 2018, another year of my poisonous bullshit.

"I want to die right now. Im depressed and keep repeating the same negative mental thought pattern. Its as if being depressed is normal for me. Its been one year since my ex broke up with me and I still havent moved on. How can I when this person used to be my everything? They were there for me and gave me the gift of happiness. My family mistreats me by calling me stupid, ugly, fat, etc., but my ex has been the only person in my life who made me feel like I had value in this world. They are the only person on this planet who knows who I truly am. But ever since they left, my entire life is empty and meanginless. I try to make friends but I cant seem to connect with anyone. Ive only had one true connection ever in my life so far, and thats with my ex. My ex wasnt perfect, but they were perfect to me. Thats why I cant seem to let go already. I know letting them go will help me so much, but I cant seem to do it yet. Its frustrating to know that the answer is simple, but emotions arent exactly rational. Im just tired of living everyday alone and lost. Im tired of not being able to break my unhealthy habits of biting the skin off of my fingers out of stress/anxiety. Im tired of bearing so much love for someone who doesnt give a shit about me anymore. Im 20 years old and yet Im failing to see the light at the end of the tunnel. I just want everything to end. I dont see happiness in my future. I dont want any more suffering from the breakup... I dont understand how loving someone and then losing them forever could make one feel so broken. Im tired of feeling unfulfilled and unworthy. I thought that this was something that goes away like a scratch, but so far I have not healed at all. I dont want to live if it means Ill be alone without someone who truly loves me. Everything is so dark and cruel. ","1"

"I'm male, 23, from the UK, and I can't believe what I'm writing. I've always had spouts of depression, but this last month has resurged it all stronger, more intense, with suicidal thoughts, and little to no way out. I completed my degree last year, had dreams of being a lawyer. Was excited to start my life and impress my family, friends, girlfriend etc.Since I left, I've been in a job I hate. It's not related to my degree or future aspirations, but it pays. However, recently, I've been told they are making cutbacks and to prepare for the worst (along with a few others) and it seems fairly certain at this point. Since I found this out (last Friday) I have spiralled into a mental state I never wanted to go. I'm fairly confident I wont have this job for much longer. I've been applying to my dream jobs for around a year now, graduate jobs are hard to get shortlisted in. But while I was getting paid, I could deal with it and be persistent. But now, what the fuck am I going to do? I can't even begin to imagine what job I would do if I lose it and still manage to pay my way. What am I going to do about next month's rent and bills? What am I going to do about Christmas? My girlfriend's birthday? Sure, I could just explain to them I can't afford it. But that makes me a failure.Utter failure of a man. I wanted to be the guy who was happy, outgoing, could impress his girlfriend's family. I wanted to be on track with my life and be excited for the future. Here I am at 23, little to no money, about to lose his job, living in a city where I know nobody, I have absolutely no way out. I have nothing to show for my life. I lived with my mother as an only child (dad died) all my life, she is poor, and I wanted to get to a point where I can treat her and make her proud. I have nothing to fall back on, I feel like the walls are closing in.Three of my friends have taken their own lives in the last two years, which also hasn't helped my mental state. But now I just can't stop thinking about how much of a relief death could actually be. No more burdens, no more worries, nothing. I have no idea if I would ever actually do it, but the thoughts are becoming more intense to the point where I wonder how I could do it.And yeah, I probably sound like a whiny first-world spoilt child. But regardless, it's how I feel. I've lost my way, I felt bad enough with the job let alone without it. I've spent the last week crying randomly, having panic attacks, thinking about what my family and girlfriend will think of me deep down (although I know they would tell me they love me anyway). But that's not the point. I don't think the reason for me being like this is the job situation, I think this has just been the trigger for something deep down. It's scary. Please someone give me some inspiration, my patience is running thin :(EDIT: just received another job application rejection. Great timing, huh. ","1"
"So I was thinking, theoretically if you wanted to slit your wrists but was weary of pain. Could you not just sit/lie on your arm, cutting off circulation to that limb until its numb. And then cut it? Yeah yeah, I know this wouldnt be entirely painless but say doing so once youve ingested alcohol too (and pills).Im testing the theory now. Im lying on my bed which is close to a wall, with the weight of my head resting on my inner elbow. My arm from below the elbow is leant upright against the wall. Its been 5 minutes now and my arm is starting to feel numb. When I pinch the surface of my skin the pain is less so that usual. However, if I pinch quite hard theres still some pain. [Im not trying to encourage anyone to do this, I just wanted to hear your thoughts].","1"
"I'm sick of people saying that my problems aren't that bad. Im sick of people saying to just love myself when I feel so unbearably alone. I absolutely hate those people. They make me feel even more alone and isolated. They just make everything worse. It seems whenever I talk about something usually someone says something that makes everything worse. So I'm done trusting people. I'm sick of being seen as weak because I can't be alone. I mean I feel like I do love myself. I just can't take being alone. I just don't want to be the only one to love myself. I want people to love and accept me for who I am. There's nothing wrong with me. I swear if I hear any more of this loving yourself bullshit and someone says that to me when I feel like I really need someone then I'm just gonna end it. All I hear when you say that is that other people get to be loved and I don't and that it's okay to treat me like an outcast and abandon and isolate me. All I hear is that I'm unworthy of love and caring from other people. I especially hate hearing this from those who have people and have someone to listen to them when I don't. Quit telling someone they're unworthy of love because of their struggles and quit saying that it's my fault for feeling like this because I won't change my way of thinking. I'm not gonna change my way of thinking. Maybe they're the ones who should change thier way of thinking. It shouldn't be considered weakness to want help and understanding.","1"
"Recently I've been feeling like I'm just letting life pass me by and not really doing anything. I don't know if it's because I haven't found my purpose in life, but I constantly feel worthless and wonder just what the fuck I am doing here. However, whenever I feel a little more calm, I think over my current situation and realize that, on the outside, things aren't really that bad and that I have love and support from my family, at least. This, in turn, leaves me in disgust with myself for even thinking about killing myself and makes me feel even worse. It feels like my value in this life is so minimal and nonexistent that, even if I have had food on my table and a roof over my head, a family that loves me (all my life) and opportunities in life, that I still somehow manage to feel like this on the inside. I just feel so useless; like I was never meant to be alive and don't even deserve the love I have been shown by others. I don't want to feel like this but I can't help but blame myself for the way I feel and think, and the poor choices I have made. It feels like a chain that's with me all the time. I feel so scared of talking about this with anyone, I feel very alone and just needed to ask someone.TL;DR I feel like I shouldn't be depressed but I am, so it makes me feel even worse ","1"
"I'm 17. Yesterday, I was too depressed to go to school. Today, I was bullied right after school by someone I thought was my friend.I drove my mom to an appointment immediately after that went down, still wanting to die, and tried to communicate that. I tell her I wanna die and she argues with me. It escalates. We pass a long row of trees and I tell her I want to crash the car into them, and suddenly she exclaims, ""Do it! I don't care! Do it!"" over and over.The lane is clear between me and the trees, i have my foot on the gas, my mother was persuading me to end us both and all i felt was apathy. I made myself look straight forward and just focused on my hands on the steering wheel.She pushed me extremely fucking close to losing it. It's been a few hours since and I'm still crying and shivering. I feel so fucking worthless and empty. I've been popping xanax just to go to school and get a night's sleep and right now I'm tempted to take some flexeril to sleep forever. I need to get out of this family badly.","1"

"I'm going to kill myself tonight. There is no scenario where I am happy again. Sure, minor happiness and joy still come. But my happiness has peaked. I can't go on living knowing that.There are, what I'm sure are, a million details I will miss. I'm not even sure why I'm sharing any of the details.I have been happily married for 5 years. We have a beautiful, 2 year old daughter. Life wasn't perfect. But I was happy.A little over a month ago, I confronted my wife about noticing she had been a little distant. At first she said it was nothing, but eventually stated that she was starting to have doubts. As a result of some recent life changes, she felt she was questioning every aspect of herself, including her relationship to me. I was obviously heartbroken, but I loved her. I told her I would go anything I could to help her.And things went forward.Everything felt okay for a while, but then the distance came back. I confronted her again and asked why. She said it was nothing. For some reason, I said something to the effect of, ""I wish there was something tangible. I almost wish you were having an affair. Then the uncertainty would have a reason.""The next day she came home from work and broke down and told me she was having an affair. I won't go into details, but the affair was emotional in nature, but to all extremes. They discussed sex. They told each other that the loved each other. I was obliterated. I know everyone involved in an affair will say the same thing, but my wife was the last person I would expect to commit an affair, for a plethora of reasons. I was blindsided and all my insecurities were stabbed.I'm quoted as saying, ""If you ever cheat on me, I will divorce you."" But, being presented with the actual situation, I decided I wanted to try to mend and forgive. We started taking those steps - marriage counseling, etc. For everything that has gone well, my wife's doubts are still there. I am skipping a large chunk, but it is coming to a point where my wife feels she would be better off on her own. She says she doesn't question me and the quality of a partner I am. She just thinks she has the capability of being her best self alone.And I do want her to be happy. I love her. I want what's best for her. But where does that leave me?I always told my wife she was my number 1. She was my world. She was the main source of my happiness. If I wasn't happy, I could go to her.I remember talking about old age and death with her. I said that if she died before me, I'd highly consider suicide, because I couldn't live without her.Well, in my current reality, she has shattered my reality and existence and then is going to leave. I feel like I will always be a shell of my former self and that isn't beneficial to anyone. My family, my wife, my daughter. Having a shell of a human in their lives will long hurt them. I feel like I can make a finite and immediate decision that will hurt them, but that they will overcome. That is better than me constantly being a bad influence.And, I get it. I shouldn't weigh all my happiness on my wife. But I did and I do. I can't change that. And, I get it. There is a hypothetical scenario where I move on, grow, even fall in love again - if that is what I choose to do. But I don't want those things. I don't.Sure, there is still a smidgen of hope that my wife decides she wants to stay with me, but I doubt it. She does too. And none of that even accounts for the actual forgiveness process that would have to happen if we tried, which also seems impossible.I am not happy and I won't be happy. My options are live an unhappy life or kill myself. I'm going to choose the latter, for everyone's sake.","1"

"It wasnt a fight or anything of the sort. We were in a long distance relationship so our relationship only went so far. We kept saying that the other one was perfect up until 3 or so months ago. Then we became really distant. We struggled to keep a conversation going and stopped doing things together. She kept saying that it was going to get better, that the distance was hurting her. I understand that. It was hurting me too. I could give anything to just have a chance at hugging her and tell her how much I loved her. She was my motivation to keep going and finish my degree. I could get a job and eventually meet and live with her. I dont have that motivation anymore. Im struggling to get out of bed and go to classes. I just had one of the worst finals in my life and Im not sure whats gonna happen next. Shes really so beautiful and such a sweetheart so I feel like Im missing on the best partner Im ever going to have. I dont know what to do anymore.

"So may be a bit of a long read so sorryIm 20 and from the uk. Had a history of eating disorders and depression since i was atleast 14. The eating disorders was mostly a control thing ( divorce,bullying..etc but thats mostly resolved now and the depression i think came from that and me isolating myself from everyone.I did get help for the depression when i was 16, avoided medication and went to therapy for a year. I thought i was ""better"".i did think i was, like i became more social and had friends and felt happy. I felt really happy for once. But since 18, my life has been an up and down mess all because of my choices. To sum up most of the bad ones in the past 2 years; binges on drink and drugs, had several intense relatioships with older men ( fyi where people have took advantage at ""parties"" ) , several risky sexual stuff like getting into car with strangers drunk in the middle of the countryside and having unprotected sex and being in a random country on holiday to meet a random person myself , cutting off friendships because i felt they were holding me back, going to 2000 debt, self harm. Like I went on a date with a guy twice and told him i loved him and was planning on dropping out of uni and moving to the city to be with him. LIKE THAT'S FUCKING CRAZY, RIGHT? But it felt normal to me.i've done most of that stuff because i felt like i was invincible and i felt crazy good for months which i why i did that. Like i felt untouchable and it felt amazing compared to how i feel but  for the past few months, its been more  of a self harm thing. Like i dont care what happens to me anymore and i've hurt so many people with my actions. Like the guilt is killing me. i can't handle the 2 sided emotion, i have no in between. Like i'm either ecstatic making poor choices or wanting to die and trying to kill myself slowly . I can't  handle it.

"I've always been an open person, about many things, who I am, where I come from, what I enjoy doing, and the lots. I can talk about the world, from a stranger to my best friend, but, I never talk about my depression/suicidal tendencies or the negative aspects of myself. In fact, I've never talked to anyone about it (with the exception of a professional in a different country secretly, and, this subreddit), and I fucking hate it, I live in a country where mental illnesses/difficulties are taboo and you can get shunned for it, I come from a somewhat religious family who would probably kill me for thinking about suicide before I even think about it (And that's without me hiding that I'm gay and an atheist in a country where being an apostate and a homosexual can you get a death sentence). It feels fucking impossible to live the way I am here, I can't even talk to my best fucking friend about it because of the fear of losing a friendship due to him being pressured, or me being a burden on him. I want to tell him, I want to break the silence but I can't, it's a can of worms I don't feel comfortable opening. One of these days, I feel like he'll somehow find out, or I'll be forced into telling him. And it puts me in the situation of 'Do I just potentially risk the friendship by telling him, or do I just stay silent about it until I'm backed into a corner?'.As for my family? No fucking way would I tell them, but my best friend?","1"
"I know there's a lot wrong with me but I always hesitated in getting real help because 1. It will hinder my work (which is stupid because in the long term if I get worse, I wouldn't be able to work anyway) 2. It is very costly and lastly 3. Where I live, having problems with mental health is looked down upon and you tend to get shunned by family and friends...A little backstory for anyone who would come across this and chooses to read on...firstly forgive me for my english, it's not the best. I grew up always being very socially awkward and I was bullied non stop and beaten up for looking masculine and not like a typical girl. This continued on until I started going to a private school where I enjoyed being one of the 'popular' kids for once. In between the time period of leaving my old school and going to the private school, I was treated for depression and prescribed medication which I never took (I can't remember if I refused them or my mother never gave them to me). However I thought of myself as 'cured' because I started losing weight and growing out my hair to look at least somewhat decent compared to before. I would binge and then purge but never realized this was a problem, in my head it was an effective way to lose weight and nobody at home questioned me either since I would just say I felt sick after eating too much then go to the bathroom to vomit out everything I just ate.In the new school I was introduced to an older man through one of my friends and we ended up being in a serious relationship for several years. 2 years in I discovered that he was cheating and that was when I fell back into depression, having constant thoughts of suicide and paranoia. We still stayed together on and off for a few more years until I made the decision that enough was enough and I ended the relationship after not being able to trust him anymore.Shortly after, I met another man who was perfect in my eyes - he was completely open about everything and I truly felt loved while I was with him. We were together for about a year, ending the relationship based on some stupid argument which had nothing to do with cheating. This time however I was not in any sort of emotional turmoil and moved on fairly easily.Throughout the time I was with my 2nd partner, my first ex still kept tabs on me and told me he had never and would never date anyone else. In a moment of weakness and loneliness, I contacted him one day thinking maybe we could give it another shot. We were together for another 2 years until the same problems arised, him cheating, me being depressed and suicidal and eventually wanting out.The next few years I stayed locked up at home not even meeting family and friends...just in a constant state of absolute misery, feeling the worst I'd ever felt to that point, no longer finding joy in anything. Somehow or another perhaps after realizing I couldn't continue being a burden to my poor parents anymore, I forced myself out of it and got a job where I could work at home and earn a living, not substantial but enough to support myself and not burden my parents who had both stopped working.I still feel severely depressed and closing in on 30 years old with just a handful of friends (all of whom are either married or available to hang out with but my social anxiety prevents me from any real life interactions) and a job that just earns me about enough to survive. I rarely leave the house unless it's to buy groceries. Appearance wise, it's never consistent as I could go weeks binging on fast food and becoming overweight to starving myself and doing water fasts to go back to my original weight. My last facebook login triggered another suicidal attempt after I found out that both my exes have gotten married in the years I was doing absolutely nothing with my life, laying in bed staring hopelessly at the ceiling thinking of killing myself but not wanting to upset my parents who ultimately would be the ones to discover my dead body.I feel embarrassed to have even typed this all out as I realize I could have just gotten it together but the thought of ending my life is constantly there...I never feel good enough or worthy to continue living... I want out but at the same time I'm too cowardly to do so. The few friends I have are aware that I have social problems but they don't know the extent of my depression and I have never once confided in them about it.My family does not believe in depression, they are extremely religious and believe that any form of mental health issue can be 'cured' through prayer which is why the only person I've confided in is my mother who I don't want to bother much as she herself has burdens of her own so I tend to just act as if everything is normal even if the night before I was in my room slicing my wrists or leaving the house at 3am looking for a high enough building I could jump off from. I have scars on my arms that are partly from cat scratches so it's easy to make excuses for all the other scars that are there from cutting myself.I grew up never being close to any of my siblings...somehow I always felt unwelcome to them and none of them has ever attempted to bond with me in any way. Being as socially awkward as I am I guess I can't blame them but there was one particular incident in which my older brother told me something that hurt me to my core and that I will never forget. Around the time I had left my old school and was severely depressed and acting out, stealing and spending money to gain friends but instead being bullied even more, my brother for whatever reason came up to me one day in the living room and said that I should end my life because nobody would miss me. It was one thing to be a punching bag in school but to have your own sibling tell you that you are completely worthless...it was just a really awful feeling.I can't fault any of them though as ultimately I'm the one with all the mental health issues and I have yet to overcome my severe social anxiety. Now I'm at the point where I'm expected to marry and have children but instead I'm stuck at home trying to survive each day trying to suppress thoughts of killing myself. I don't even know how I would go on even if i did overcome all my issues as I now harbour thoughts of hating the idea of being intimate with either men or women and I don't ever want to have children.If there's any way I could get help without incurring a ton of debt, I would be very grateful. I do want help. I don't want to spend my days crying in bed and thinking of how useless I am and plotting ways to kill myself. I want to be a useful member of society. I want my parents to be proud of me instead of being ashamed of having a child who's known to be a loner and doesn't ever leave the house. A complete loser.Getting treated here is very costly and I want to know if there's any alternatives, maybe meditation, anything aside from prayer as I did that and just ended up becoming an atheist as it did nothing but worsen my suicidal thoughts. If you have any suggestions please let me know, and thank you for reading.","1"

"I thought about writing a post for weeks now, but I always stopped myself because as a realist I know that comforting words from strangers isn't going to solve my problem.  It's comforting to think that if you have depression for a really long time, it's probably just an imbalance in your brain and medications and treatment can help.  It's comforting to think that if it's not an imbalance, I'm probably just working myself up for no reason and I can try new things and change my attitude, use the tools and advice that others give me to gain control of my life.But comforting thoughts aren't the real world.  People say to not let the things you can't control bother you, but how can you not?  When forces outside of your control directly influence your life in ways you can't fight against, what do you do?  I already know now that with the hope of a way out, I can feel perfectly happy.  Happiness is a real thing even though I felt like it was a myth for so many years.  But for so many god damn years, forces outside of my control undermine EVERY FUCKING EFFORT I EVER PUT IN.  I fight SO god damn hard for my own happiness and my own life, but it means nothing.  Decades of misery with breaks so short they are gone in a flash.  No amount of distractions kept it away forever.  Becoming a good person I can be proud of didn't make an ounce of difference.I thought that having low standards and low expectations would make it easier to remain content, but I can't even get the things that many take for granted.  I have no concept of a home, much less a stable one.  I have no concept of family, no concept of friendship, no concept of love.  I'm an affectionate person who only wants companionship and stability who can't find a single fucking place to belong.Everything becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.  I maintain a cheery attitude, just looking forward to the simple joys and company of others.  But I still get rejected.  People always adore me when I am comforting to them in a hard time, but once they've gotten what they need, I serve no purpose to them.  I can't get that same compassion back.  I get that I'm too negative and screwed up to contribute much anymore, but dammit how can I get out of it when I have nobody to lean on?  People get through really hard things because they have some sort of support system with loved ones or resources.  I have literally not a damn thing.  I don't have my health, I don't have money, I don't have a fucking thing.  How fucked up is it that I have to fight so hard when my only desire in life is a place to belong and someone to love?  Fucking fuck this.  Writing this here feels so damn stupid because the people who've known me for years ignore every cry for help I ever put out.  Even if I flat out tell them I'm killing myself, they don't fucking care.  When they think I'm dead and gone, they drag my name through the mud.  Is humanity just sick?I'm so fucking sick of lazy platitudes like ""it gets better"" and ""someone out there will care"".  Come with evidence or keep yer trap shut, that's what I say.  It doesn't get better for everyone.  There are people in this world who die miserable and alone, some at no fault of their own.  I'm tired of being made to feel guilty for wanting out when NOBODY has any tangible workable solution.  Years of ""I don't know what to tell you"" and made up optimist bullshit.  I'm so sick of this I can't take it anymore.Here I am foolishly posting this for the world to see, knowing nothing will come of it.EDIT:  Thanks everyone for reinforcing my points.  I'll never feel guilty about wanting to die again.  I can go in peace now.","1"
"I hope it's alright to post here. Don't really know where to go. I'm not suicidal so I want to get that right off the table. I used to be 10 years ago, but not anymore. Can't really explain why, but I'm just not.I'm just done with life. I've spent most of my life looking at things I've done and realized I was a huge failure. Pretty much no matter how much I try, I'm just a fuck-up. That's it. I fuck everything up. I make life more difficult for everyone around me.Supposedly, the doctors have figured out the issue. Something is wrong in my head and there's nothing they can do about it. It means I'm always tired. I have a hard time focusing. I'll forget pretty much everything I'm told or that I read. I make shitty decisions because of the focus and forgetfulness. These were all things I thought were in my control. I just hadn't figured out exactly what the issue was. But, now I'm told that there's nothing I can do about it. I have an issue, but it's still being researched. I think the worst part of this is that it puts an undue burden on others, especially my wife. I've been a shitty-ass husband. I've been a shitty-ass son, a shitty friend, and my biggest fear is I'll be a shitty father to my boys.What the fuck am I to do? If I realized 5 years ago that I had there was an non-treatable and incurable condition that would keep me like this and would probably get worse with age, I never would've gotten married. My wife deserves better than that.So, now I think....if something were to happen to me, it's actually not the worst thing that can happen for me or for my family.Yeah, I get it. It would be tough for my kids. And I think about how difficult it would be without a dad. But, I also can't decide which is worse: no dad, or a shitty dad. At least I couldn't fuck up their lives.I try to be better. Try to do what I should. Try to be successful and be a good husband and a good person, in general. But every fucking attempt is failure in one form or another.I'm just tired. And I'm tired of all this shit and I'm tired of being a disappointment and knowing my wife regrets being with me.I'm ready for death. I won't go looking for it, but I can't help but think that it would be better for others if I just slipped away one day.And, yet, there's a part of me that can't give up. I can't just sit in a slump feeling sorry for myself. I will keep trying because it's who I am and what I do. I hate being called lazy. It's the worst thing, but that's what I'm called every day...all because of something that I can't control. So, I'll keep pushing myself.This is just a vent. Something to get off my chest. My wife isn't very sympathetic. So, talking to her is a waste of time. And before anyone jumps on her, I don't blame her. If I had to put up with the bullshit she's had to for the last few years, I probably wouldn't be sympathetic, either. I've been a horrible ass, and I deserve it. Thanks for listening to my stupidity.","1"

"Ive been going through the worst year of my life so far and its getting to the point where suicidal thoughts become more and more frequent, and more comfortable. I dont want to think like this, there are people in my life who care for me so much and I know how devastated they would be if I ever took my own life, but my constant paranoia and self-hate is taking over and I cant seem to stop it. I just need someone to talk to so I can feel a little less crazy and a little more confident in my chaotic life.","1"
"This is probably going to be one mess of a post, I'm not doing super well right now.I can remember but one time in my life when I've been consoled by anyone and that was when I was a little kid and scared to death because of a surgery I had to undergo and my mom would tell me she would go in my stead if she only could. After that I've never had anyone, not my mom or dad not my brother or friends, notice and aknowledge how bad I've felt and talk to me about it or even just hug and hold me. Not a single time when I was having a meltdown or anxiety attack or when I've wanted to kill myself. In part because I have no one to talk to either, but from what I've read from online sources it sounds like being consoled is pretty common? Like having people notice when you're not doing so good and act on it is something that totally happens in real life? Even just having more experienced people give advice or mentor you is something I haven't experienced much. Guidance, I guess. Literally the only time anyone has taken the time to properly teach me anything was an acquaintance teaching me to play dota so I could play with them. I played for the company until I got sick of the game and now no one plays anything with me because I don't want to play dota.I'm sick of making constant efforts all by myself (regarding getting some help with my mental health - no one's ever offered to help nor ask about it and for years I convinced myself I was imagining things, trying to be a special snowflake or something) and they're not even paying off very much. I hate being this envious of everyone I hear from, it sounds like things just fall in my friend's lap without her trying all that much and she is able to enjoy that too because she isn't a depressed, socially anxious mess like me. She is able to see things she wants to achieve in life and she can be excited just about everything. She's planning for her dream job and she talks of ways of getting prettier and she has roommates she instantly clicked with. The only roommates I've ever had avoided me and never talked to me. ALthough I suppose eventually I mirrored that right back at them. For me, this friend I mentioned is the only person who even talks to me frequently. And she seems uncomfortable to talk about my depression or offer any support, not that I can blame her very much but I always offer her every support she's asked for and humored all her more weighty conversation topics that I realized were such. Most every day for me is trying to convince myself I don't have enough reason to kill myself yet and that there might be something to look forward to once I start therapy. I can't enjoy almost anything I used to love and I have no one or nothing to spend my days with, other than the vortex of depressive and anxious thoughts that make up most of my inner dialogue. I have no dreams to pursue and I'm probably unemployable. I barely even have items I want. I've never had a job other than one internship that was arranged for me, despite my best efforts at summerjob hunting for the last three or so years. I think the only reason I haven't attempted suicide yet is because I know for a fact that it would either cripple me to a point where I'll be unable to attempt again or to where I'm unable to get help in which case I suppose I would still die but it would be out of dehydration or hunger instead. Or else I'd succeed without anyone even knowing I was contemplating it and then they'd find out in maybe a month or two from now if even then because that's how much contact I have with people. Well, I also never want to do that to my brother because I care about him but his mental health can't be the sole reason for my continued existence when it's like this most of the time. I wish I was a robot so I could turn myself off but no one would have to be very sad because it's always possible to turn me back on, at least in theory. I'm so tired and I feel broken and I wish I could've been the boringly average, mostly happy kid instead. As things are, killing myself is the only future I can see unless I get ""lucky"" and die of something else before I do it myself. I don't think I've told that to anyone before, and I've only told a psychologist about the occasional suicidal thoughts.Thanks to any who read through all this and I'm sorry it was so whiny. I have no one to talk to as I've found out this last year, and needed to get these things out even if it is to internet strangers. Also, I'm not about to kill myself today but this felt too suicide-related for the depression subreddit.","1"

"This will be long. I don't know if many of you will read through this, I would like to hope some people will. Ever since I was in sixth grade, I have been somebody who is mentally off. I would ponder about religion, about how I couldn't understand where the ""god"" I was told to believe in came from, about how I didn't believe that ""god"" existed, about how I yearned to know what would happen to people after death. In seventh grade, my life gained some stability. I had one steady friend I would socialize with at school. For whatever reason, to other kids I felt like I was an odd one out, and was often treated as such. However, this was one of the few instances in my life where I can recall a stable household life. The one kid I found friendship with at the time received a multi-month suspension from school. I underwent a deep depression, likely because I had no friends. I felt alone. Everyday before school, I would beg to be homeschooled, kick and cry like a toddler, and think about how my deepest desire was my death. Eventually this passed, however the overall depressed feeling didn't. In eighth grade, I had an alright year. I feel like eighth grade is when I had my final period where I was truly blissfully happy at times despite my depression. In April of my eighth grade year, my family and I took a vacation together to visit my brother. I would say this is my last happy memory. In early ninth grade, my mother disappeared for a extended period of time, and ever since then, I can't say she has been my mother. The most helpful things she has done for me since that time was pick me up from school or buy me fast food after school, when I would often feel empty. She became a raging alcoholic. She was no longer somebody I could have laughs with, confide in, or relate to. She was always belligerently drunk and incoherent after my ninth grade year. I remember this year, I entered a depression much similar to my seventh grade year. My father and I have always had a very complicated relationship. I unquestionably love this man to death and he is the most important individual in my life. Throughout my middle school and high school years, I did have tendencies to act like a spoiled child, because despite my unhappy home life, I did have a tendency to always get the material things I desired. However people have validated that I do not appear to be as spoiled, or behave as spoiled, as my father often accused me of. Throughout high school, My Dad would often emotionally harass me. I do not feel as though he realized it. There were times when I was at my emotional lows, and he would bother to do nothing in terms of emotional support but drag me down further through insults and harassment, and there were times I felt alright, and he would come home and ruin it. Despite my emotional struggles throughout high school, my Father never failed to be there for me, in a financial sense. In high school, I spent most of my evenings and weekends pathetically lonely. I had three close friends, maybe four, however I didn't truly relate to these people, and at times when reflecting I feel like the main reason I may have decided to spend time around some of these individuals was my lack of options in my social life. Towards the end of my high school career, I held a solid GPA of around a 3.6 and performed well on the SAT. My Father and I began discussing college. I realized that I wanted to go away to a large university that was a reasonable distance away. I wanted to be at a university where I didn't feel like everyone knew everyone, like they do in high school. I wanted to be at a university that put me in a completely new location, where I wouldn't have to deal with the lurking empty memories and emotions I associated with my hometown and high school. And as I stated before, my father, when it comes to things I ask for, rarely fails. I found myself getting accepted into a relatively good school that was out of state but not ridiculously expensive. One thing that always bothered me in high school was my lack of social life, sex life, and the fact I had never had a girl friend. In the beginning of my freshman year of college, I quickly entered my first relationship. It was really fun at first, and should have been a fling, but lasted way too long, resulted in me not developing a lot of friendships in the beginning of college, and ultimately left me feeling awful. I did learn a lot from this experience. After that relationship, I did go on to make several good friends at my university I feel that I truly relate to.I would like to say, that currently, I am a engineering major. I major in both mining and civil engineering, and am on a rigid five year path to receive dual degrees. Exiting high school I realized I have no idea what I wanted to do as an adult in terms of a career, so I decided to study engineering as I knew it was something that often resulted in solid salaries with high employment rates. Due to starting off slightly behind the average engineer, I was a semester behind. I realized I had excellent grades at the end of my freshman year, no internship, no true friends back home, and not much to return home to, so I decided to go to school during the summer. While I successfully put myself ontrack with other engineers during the summer, I reached one of my low points of my life. I found myself alone, for extended periods of time, with nothing to do but sit myself down and study complex science and mathematics. This was the first time in my life I felt truly suicidal. I was able to pull through, getting B's in every course I took in the summer, heading in to my second fall semester with a overall gpa of a 3.68. This semester, I was slated to take 18 credit hours however I decided to only take fifteen. I am currently enrolled in a engineering course called statics. There are four sections of statics taught this semester where I attend university, and by chance I ended up getting one of the worst professors at the university for statics. Firstly, I will say that after being in school, busting my ass, for a consecutive year, my effort has taken a dip, however this dip has not been significant. Due to my professor, and the toll in my effort, I am now borderline between a D and C in statics, more likely to get a D than I am a C. This may not seem like a big deal, but it is to me. I feel obligated to due well and excel in school as my father pays for my education. This semester I have been careless with his money and spent a good bit more then I should have. However I have been upfront with him about my lapse of effort, my spending habits, my feeling of being worn out after so many consecutive semesters of difficult material in school. He is very understanding of my struggles and tells me all he wants is to see me relax, to see me be happy and enjoy my youth and find myself and take things slow. But his words don't prevent me from feeling like a failure.If I am to fail statics, this means I will either have to become a six year student to receive to undergraduate degrees, neither of which really interest me, especially the mining degree, which brings me a ton of financial aid. It is difficult for me to change majors, as my tuition would go up drastically and I could potentially loose scholarships. Switching schools is also extremely difficult, as few schools would give me the same financial package that this school gives me. If I were to return home, I would get a decent amount of money in scholarships, but I would return to a place full of bad memories where I have little friends. The alternate to a sixth year as an undergraduate is to go to school another summer, and given the location of my school, it is relatively remote here in the summers. I simply do not think I have another summer semester of school in me. I also strive for internships, so I can make myself a valuable employee, despite the fact I know I likely will not find myself enjoying them. Even if my current worry is not statics, it would be something else. I constantly am a unhappy, suicidal person. I have had counselors on and off since I was in sixth grade. I have taken antidepressants. I have expanded my social life. I have tried a lot to improve my social life. I do not want to be a student, studying two undergraduate degrees, one of which I really simply don't give a fuck about, for six years. I don't want to spend another summer, in the middle of no where, studying every god damn fucking day. I do not want to return home, where I have empty sad memories. I do not want to pursue internships, in a field where I find myself with zero interest. I understand that there are kids starving in Africa. I understand there are kids with awful childhoods much worse then mind where there are both emotional and financial struggles. I understand I am much more well off and spoiled then some other kids. However I simply feel very little happiness. I've done the things you are supposed to do. Go to counseling, branch out, exercise, try anti depressants. I don't see purpose in my life. I constantly feel over whelming depression, anger, anxiety, and difficulty moving forward. I constantly see myself as someone who isn't enough. I constantly have visions of myself tieing a noose, jumping off a bridge, loading a gun and saying my goodbye to the world. I just truly don't want to deal with any of it anymore. I don't want to go home. I don't want to be a student anymore. I don't want to complain anymore. I don't want to study anymore. I don't want to wake up anymore. I know life is hard, I know life gets much harder then getting a D in college. Maybe life just isn't for me, maybe I am just not built for life. I don't have an abundance of friends, I've never really had a true girl friend. If I had a handgun, I would load it with a sense of euphoria and end my life in this moment. I feel like I simply wasn't mean't to be, wasn't cut out for life.","1"

"I have lived a very long life at only 28 (male). I grew up in a drug house with abusive parents. They are currently still on drugs til this day. When they were not dealing drugs, they were dealing jesus, causing me to be brutally raped by people of their congregation twice at ages 9 and 10.Aside from the rape, and abuse of my parents, I was beat up in school around 3 times a week from ages 6-13 for no other reason then being a small black kid. The kids were usually alot older than me. I would run from them at first. Then I noticed it didnt matter, I was still going to get hurt. so I would walk from them while they beat the shit out of me. When they would put me down, I would stay down. I would let them do their thing until they were satisfied. They noticed that I would just let them beat me up, so after they beat me up they resorted to peeing on me. Then I had to make the walk of shame back to the house that doesn't give a fuck about me, to be hurt all over again in different ways.I attempted to cope through my adolescence, but I was a very confused person. I had all dignities taken away, my childhood was gone. Never anything for me under the Christmas tree. Never any valid birthday presents. I remember going hungry. I remember looking into my little sister's face and apologizing for her stomach hurting from starvation.Ok back on topicLife has been shit. It remains shit. I have children now. And I feel very detached from them. My wife has left me As I have severe anxiety, a paranoia disorder, and ptsd from most of these events. She took the children. I walk to work, I work all day speaking to hardly anyone because I look 'scary', then I walk back home to be alone. Every day. Same thing. Pay bills go to sleep. Pay bills go to sleep. I have to think about everything that has happened. Every waking second. I can't do it anymore. I can't. I can still feel them trying to hurt me. I don't even feel like a man and never have even though I try to compensate being all macho, when ultimately I just don't want to feel like someone's plaything. I went to therapy for about 7 months. They didn't help. The pills didn't help. Felt like a waste of time. They seemed like they never had enough time for me. No one ever has.""Stop being a little bitch""I'm trying. But I am tired. Its never gotten better. I can't think of a day I would like to go back to. I hope every day that a car will swerve and hit me. I hope every day that someone will think I'm just scary enough to shoot for no reason. Alot of people care about me. They say they do. But where are they? I am still alone.I left alot out. I'm crying while writing this. I think it's really time. I am scared, because I feel it has to happen. This is all 100% legit btw. I just needed at least a little bit of my story to be seen.","1"

But bah I just hope to those who took 5 minutes of their precious life to read about my average-no so especial life maybe I could leave a little bit of my self for a while. Through out my life I have been all kind person, I mean I have been good, bad, gentle, rude, romantic, obscene, maniatic, committed, but mostly (and must of all) a fcking pice of shit. Every person which use and is around me gets hurt in any kind of way. I have lost, friends, family, lovers, all because that the way I am (I guess so?) Most lately I have lost the love of the person I have love the most in my entire life, that was 3 months ago, and I can't, I just can't get my life back in track, I have tried, god i have tried. But it just it seems there's no point of doing so. I have 25 years old, alcoholic and drogadict, still leaving with my parents piece of shit, who has al ready tried once to check out earlier, but hell spat me out back. I have cause to my family lots (LOTS), instead of being a son to be proud of I feel they are ashamed of me, and well I such is life. I will always love to be the kind of kid which parents have a wall full of throphies and medals and awards, but since I was a kid I was a real trash of existence. And now here I am feeling like a burden, more like a person who can help his family and keep it together and happy. But well I have not even graduated from college yet, when all my friends already have, and I am often compared to that statement. But well my dear reader I hope I didn't take to much of your time, and well tomorrow I plan to take 60 mg of clonazepam with a very nice tequila bottle and for god sake I hope this time works.

I hope no one I know has a similar suffering within them, it would break my fucking heart to find out one of the people I know killed themselves, but I can't hold myself to the same standard, I really want to kill myself and I'm not strong enough to reach out IRL not even to my therapist.

"A good friend of mine has attempted suicide twice in one week by now, both through overdosing.I'm having trouble with how to handle this. Yesterday we were making plans to do something to get her mind to something else. This morning I got a call that she tried it again. Last time I managed to get to work, but today I just was looking for other things to take my mind of the news.I'm rather level-headed, but twice in a week is tough as hell. Last week I told one of my friends about the situation, she was supportive about it. Today I reached out to my old study group, while not mentioning who it was. I'm lucky that they are quite supportive, asking often how I'm doing in this situation.Thing is, I can't shake the feeling of being sad that easily. I understand she did both actions in an attempt to make her boyfriend keep her, it actually did the opposite. I just can't wrap my head around how she came up with the idea in the first place.It doesn't help either that I can't talk about it at our mutual club. Only the chairman knows what is going on, while the members are wondering what is going on. I get asked about it and I play it off as that she is sick.How should I handle myself around someone who is prone to suicide? I'm pretty sure if I get a call for the third time at work, that I will call myself in sick.","1"

"Hi. I am 27 years old. I have been contemplating suicide for a really long time. For many, many years. I want to end my life. But I don't necessarily want to kill myself. I don't really want an advice. I don't want people to tell me that life has a lot to offer. I already know that. What I need is someone to change my life. I don't have the strength, or the motivation, or the money to do it. So, as a last resort before killing myself I guess, I am asking you. Do something to change my life. Marry me, adopt me, give me a job, give me a place, anything. I need someone to change my life. This is the first and the last time that I am publicly accepting that I am this weak. Please do something. ","1"

It's just fucking pathetic because we have been friends for 12 years how little he cares and i'm so close to actually doing it now since no one will care if I'm gone.

"Hello everyone...Warning: This will not be coherent typing for the most part, Im just typing as Im thinking. My apologies. Im a 19 year old college student currently in his sophomore year. This semester has been the hardest. It started off OK, but then I had a mental breakdown and withholding it for so long finally caught up to me. I ended up dropping two of my four courses, even though I told my parents I wanted to drop all of them so I could figure things out, they didnt support that and since I go to a community college and live with them I ended up regretfully doing what they told me to do. I just dropped my third class on the final day to drop and now I have three Ws on my transcript. So now I have one class left and Im going to get a B in it when it wouldve been an A had I just taken it next semester a as I originally wanted. Depression has been in my life for quite some time. As a kid I was obese and constantly bullied and never had any friends (still dont) I changed that my freshman year of high school and lost 127 pounds by the time I was in my junior year of high school. Well, I noticed something was wrong my senior year, I started eating like shit again and was gaining some weight back. I ignored it. Then came freshman year of college, I ended with a 3.5 even though I never let myself study and was invited to an honor society, scholastic leadership and honors classes. Then the problems got worse, I continued to gain weight and I did worse in school. The above mentioned programs I was in, I was kicked out because my gpa dropped to 3.241. Now were to this semester and I feel Ive fucked up so much and its embarrassing. I gained all the weight back and Im just a fat fucking piece of shit. I hate my life and I hate that Ive allowed myself to fuck me over constantly. When I broke down I finally admitted my problems to my parents as I was worried what theyd feel like since their golden child is so fucked up mentally and Im seeing a counselor but I ended up cancelling last week because I told her the last session I was doing better with eating and getting that on track (that was true) but I ended up fucking up big time and kept eating like shit after doing well for about two weeks. I feel trapped. I feel worthless. Im going to see my counselor on Friday and talk about if shes willing to provide documentation of my issue to my college so that I can have my withdrawals exempted, but Im not sure how that all works and even if Ill have mine be exempted. I knew I shouldve just took a break from school but I allowed my parents to pressure me into working it out. So now I may be permanently stuck with 3 Ws on my transcript. I didnt even want to go to community college but I decided to because I wanted to get into UT Austin, but thats not ever happening so Ive settled on UT Dallas but Im not sure if thats going to be possible either. Funny thing is... I was automatically accepted into UT Dallas out of high school, but no I was a fucking idiot and decided to go to community college because I wanted to go to UT Austin. Ive fucked up so much and I just cant handle it anymore. I dont know what to do. I feel so lost. I want to finish my computer science degree but its just so hard. I really wish my parents wouldve been more supportive of my decision, but I understand why they were so hesitant since they both almost finished college but never did. Its just I needed that time and I did get some time to reflect and get help, but not enough. Im trying to get back to a normal course load next semester but Im not sure if thats going to be realistic. Im sorry again for the incoherent wall of text. ","1"

There's been a fair share of highs and lows in our relationship. I really love him so much, he is a really great guy when he is calm and happy but when he gets depressed he says the most hurtful things. So it usually happens when he's in his most vulnerable state, like when he's alone in his apartment, when he's broke, or when a lot of things just happen to go wrong that day. Just recently he told me he wishes he had never been born coz his parents, his siblings, me included (he thinks im insecure), no one in his life is worth looking up to and that nothing in his life is worth getting in up in the morning for. He mostly also blames me for not having friends because he's focused on me since im his gf and he spends all his time on me but i never stopped him from making friends. Sometimes i feel like i can't share my feelings with him when i'm down because he's either gonna tell me i'm insecure and he can't look up to someone like me or one-up my situation by telling me his life is worse, so i constantly have to be ""strong for him"". Anyways when he starts to tell me this and that he wants to kill himself, which mostly happens on chat, because when i'm around him, he's usually fine, i mostly just tell him that i'm here to listen because i keep thinking that what id tell him would most likely be wrong and he always tells me he wishes someone was able to tell him the right things, right after ive given him some advice, but i don't know what the right things to say are. It wouldve been easier if it happened in person coz i could just listen and hold him but it is different in chat. I desperately need help. I want to help him and i wanna be able to react properly when it happens again. What should I do?","1"
"I really just dont even wanna go on any more. I dont see a point to sticking around. I feel like Ive already come to terms with death and knowing Ill probably kill my self eventually I just dont know when. I wish someone would just kill me or I die in an accident so I dont have to do it myself. I feel like that would hurt less people. Who knows???","1"

"I don't remember ever really being happy. I've been content but that's the extent of it. Some days I feel like I'm wading through endless thoughts of self hate. Some days its so bad that I feel like I'm drowning in it and I figure out how to make it stop. My roommates offer no help, stating they suffer from depression too. When I confided in my parents that not a day goes by that I don't fantasize about killing myself, I was told ""Oh you should probably get therapy."" and that was it. I would go to therapy and take medication, if I had insurance. I constantly feel like I can't do anything right and that every person I come in contact with is criticizing me. Most days, after I get off work, I'll lay in bed and hardly get up. The only reasons I'll even get up is to get food or use the bathroom. My roommates still expect me to act a certain way, to want to go out, to want to talk. They both claim to have depression, and maybe they do, but they aren't supportive in the slightest. I don't know what to do anymore. I don't feel like talking helps anymore. I feel like a lost cause, like nothing is or will get better, ","1"
"Im 17. Abuse started since I was 6. Some frightening things happened, and my mental health has always been shit, but lately Ive noticed Ive been having flashbacks of my early childhood and have gone increasingly anxious by the second. I still live with my abusor. Im trying to move out, and something tells me shit is starting to resurface. But I dont want to minimize peoples traumatic experiences so Im hesitant to say I have some unresolved trauma, but I really want to let it out to my therapist. Idk. I mean I know it doesnt matter but Im kind of having a hard time understanding if what I went through was bad enough for me to think it was truly traumatic and if I should even address it at all. TL;DR Do I open the can of worms?","1"
"I'm in an abusive living situation and I can't handle the constant insults, hate, and intentionally disheartening speak.... Anyone I tell just says I have it coming and it's all my fault.... I can't stop crying and I'm seriously thinking about killing myself tonight","1"
"My life has been shit for the last 5 years or so, but i always managed. I wasn't happy, but i wasn't sad either. The word 'meh' summarizes it perfectly. Even though i wasn't happy, i never thought of death. But then, a couple of months ago, i noticed that i started thinking shit like ""Man, i wish i was dead"", but never ""i want to die"". That went on for a while, but yesterday was the first time i actually started to think about suicide. I thought about it for a long time, how i would do it, where, when (new years), what kind of messages would i leave behind, what i would write in them specifically, what i would do in my last days, etc. When i thought about it, i was terrified. What if i were to actually do it? At that moment, i felt sad, scared, i felt self pity, etc. But it felt good. It felt REALLY good. Those feelings of sadness, of fear, made me feel more alive than i can even remember. They felt more deep than the shallow happiness i feel from watching a youtube letsplay, or something similar. It was an addictive sort of sadness.Ah, sorry, went on a rant. thanks.","1"
"Hey guys,Dont usually post on reddit much (more of a lurker). But here we are. Why am I here right now? Well a few reasons:Firstly, I was bullied during high school, and while I did go and see a therapist I still have that nagging anxiety, low self esteem and overthinking that seeps into my everyday life.Secondly, I thought going to uni in the city might change things, as many people told me it might, but it only made me feel more alone. I didnt like my course (luckily I did make a few friends). I decided to go home to the countryside as emotionally I didnt handle being away from home too well.Thirdly, at uni I got a parasitic infection which supposedly should be gone (infection occured about 4 months ago, took antibiotics), but some symptoms are still present in a mild state. I am in a small amount of pain every day. I feel trapped in my job at the local supermarket, but it keeps me active (as most of the time I only feel like I have the energy to keep playing video games or listening to music).I feel like I have all of these problems and no one understands how I feel (including my family). I wish the infection symptoms would just go away completely, I am sick of suffering and want to get on with rebuilding my life.Would appreciate if someone could listen or give advice, feel very alone in my life right now and definitely not in a good place.","1"

I know i will never be happy when i dont have a goal to go towards. lately my new job has been keeping these tendencies in check, but i had a bad day at work today. i just want to swallow so many pills since i dont have a gun to shoot myself with. i wish i knew if the pills would kill me. i try to tell my girlfriend about these feelings but talking about this with her is worthless","1"
"I thought I had adhd.-Poor focus, except for things that I am greatly interested in -Struggle with learning that involves changes -Move from activity to activity rapidly -Disorganised -Forgetful -Big mood swings -Anger -Drink a lot of caffeine to function -Leave things unfinished -Daydream often / Zone out -Sudden thoughts (with associated feelings) that I should make a massive life change, then I lose interest -Zone out when people are talking -Get bored easily -Inner impulse pushes me away from boring things -Procrastinate -It is a great effort to do tasks that require care/concentration -Rush to finish things-Get overwhelmed by multiple tasks -Often late -Impulsive decision making, poor planning of consequences -Sudden drive to do certain activities / Sudden drive not to do activities -Small bursts of energy (maybe once a day) -Avoid sleep until late (sleep is boring?) -Struggle without structure/clearly defined, unchanging rules -Make silly mistakes -Compulsions (checking doors, my car, where I have put things) -Confusion over what to doBut it is not that.I have tried heaps of medications and they don't work.I thought that the reason the medication didn't work is that I had underlying adhd.Now I know that that is not the case.I have a major depression that cannot be alleviated with medication.I have failed repeatedly in my life and thought that I had an answer, a condition that can be treated.I am 32 and nearly broke, with no good career prospects and multiple embarrassing depressive episodes and conversations with others.I am that guy in the system that everyone pity's.Now I have an answer, and it is something that can't be treated.I am going to be stuck in this life, on medication that turns me into a zombie and robs me of libido. That blurs my vision. They shrug their shoulders, its either medication or it is depression.My life is over, I dont want to deal with side effects and educational deficits, low paying jobs because I cant handle other ones and low achievement. Its not adhd, I am behind in life because I was lazy and gave in to depression and didn't seek help earlier. I am not some smart ADHD person that can be helped quickly, I am an underachieving person with depression. Plenty of people have depression and still achieve great things - I haven't because I lack the ability/intelligence. There's no magic bullet, no great reason.I am already way behind my friends.I don't want to be the low achieving nut.I don't want to be the guy alone and broke while everyone succeeds.I dont want to keep living","1"

"Helloreddit!First of all I am 19 years old male with no history of mental illnesses, no abuse, and a normal happy life, with happy family. I don't do drugs, but Ismoke and drink, or used to drink a lot of coffee, before this happened.MyMental HELL began2 months ago. I feel like something in my mind broke... And do you know the reason? I heard of someone who died bysuicide. Since then, my life changed completely.I don't know why.I don't know how.I don't know what to do next.I suddenly asked myself:""Why he did it, he had 6 kids, he had everything? What kind of force drive him to suicide? What stops me from doing it too?"" and then I experienced something strange, something confusing.I have really hard time describing what is happening in my brain(nearly impossible), but i will try. Life feels meaningless without any apparent reason. I am constantly anxious, have less energy. I don't go outside as I used to. I am constantly in my home, searching google articles about mental issues and so on. I am constantly in my head.My interest in people dissapeared. There are other weird feelings in my head:(As I said, I can't trully describe them.)weird feeling:It feels like i imagine waking up everyday but it feels like i am waking every minute.weird feeling:Feels like I won't be here soon.weird feeling:When I try to do something I can't do for long time. Eventually there is a weird feeling associated with a throughts like the above that doesn't allow me to do it. It is strange, feels like anxiety a bit, but not exactly.weird feeling:When I am relatively okay, there is a feeling like I am anxious, idk strange feeling in the stomach(not exactly anxiety.) Can't fully describe it.weird feeling:Like i am dissociated with life(not like the derealization stuff) - again I am not sure what it is it feels strange.weird feeling:Feeling like I don't want to get better.(This is the scariest one.)weird feeling:Feeling like years have passed between my old life and now.weird feeling:Feeling like there is no emotional content in my memories.weird feeling:Confusion if I am suicidal or not.weird feeling:Feeling like a wave between now and the future happens in my head and makes me feel tired and anxious.(This happens especially in the morning, when I stand up and stop being sleepy it dissapears.)weird feeling:When I do something it randomly appears it is like a feeling of /suicidality/hopelessness/flying feeling/ (not sure can't describe it.) and when this happens there is a strike in my stomach.weird feeling:There are pictures stuck in my head(2 or 3) mostly regarding to future. for example: me in the garden of my university walking - like i am looking at myself from a flying drone. they seem dark or super bright in my head.weird feeling:Feeling that there is something wrong with my thinking pattern and my rational thinking.weird feeling:Sudden feeling of being trapped(In life?). (It happens randomly.)weird feeling:That I will suicide if I work, and since then I am not working.weird feeling:Going out seems weird/scary/overwhelming/I don't know.weird feeling:Something that happened a long time ago seems close, something that happened a short time ago feels far.weird feeling:This is about babies. Somewhere I have read ""I don't want kids on this terrible world."" And now there is a weird feeling when I see a baby.weird feeling:Everything seems darker.AND THE MOST IMPORTANT :WEIRD FEELING THAT IF I WORK/GO TO UNIVERSITY OR FEEL OVERWHELMED I WILL S....... FEELING THAT I AM ALREADY OVERWHELMED AND WILL S......Yesterday I read somewhere that you are suicidal if you have desire to die. When I read this I had Anxiety attack and the thoughts felt so real, it lasted about an hour then I felt normal, and the thoughts seemed less real.And many intrusive suicidal thoughts about 16 to be exact, I picked a lot of them while researching and now they are stuck in my head. But I will not list them because they may trigger someone.I visited 5 psychiatrists, yet,no clear diagnosis. One of them suggested Adjustment Disorder, but I don't think that this is the case, exept I moved to new city(1 year ago.)(because I study there.), and had a lot of stress during exams, nothing more.Do I sound suicidal?Thanks in advance,have a good night.","1"
"My aunt (whos always been there for me when my parents werent, and is someone I look up to) told me Im verbally abusive to my bf. I was asking her to pick me up at a train station and she responded with that. Literally just message after message of telling me it makes her sad to watch me treat him like that blah blah. Most of what I say to him are jokes. Like how one would roast their co workers or friends.  Hes told me know knows its just me joking, and just my personality, but idk if I believe him. I feel like a human garbage can Im a really sensitive person, and what shes telling me is starting to get to me. I cant help but think Im the reason my bf is depressed.

Im not looking for pity or anything I just want to get this all off my chest. I wish he didnt leave me. He gave me a reason to go on and get help but now that Im off my medication and just laying here in the dark it kinda seems like I shouldve did this a long time ago. I just wish he loved me like I loved him. I probably dont make any sense, Im not really right right now but I just wanted to tell anyone who listened about how I felt. ","1"
"Hello everyone... I have been dealing with depression at a very young age. I have had depression since I was four years old. I have always have self harm issues. I got scars on my neck, my arms, my ribs... I recently have gotten into getting drunk and drinking. The pain and the not wanting to live has gotten really difficult. I have always been told to get over it by everyone. That other people have life worst. It sucks because no one gives a shit. They think its all a cry for attention. I tried reaching out four months ago for help because I have lost my will to live. No one gave a shit except one person who doesnt even live here in my country. He has been here for me since those four months ago. He has helped me a bit and now all I look forward to is talking to him and knowing he wont judge. A week ago, he started acting different. Like if my mental illness and anxiety is annoying him. He finds it annoying that Im so clingy and that Im jealous of another girl that he says is just a friend... he texted me that we need to talk tomorrow morning. I dont want to do it. I know what hes going to say and do. He will leave like everyone always does. Hell stop giving a shit like everyone always does. Everyone always abandons me. I just want to end all this pain. Not only because of him (because he is just a small reason.) but because I just have so much more going on in my life and no one fucking understands. I dont want to be here no more. I dont know what to do about it because I already have a note... yes that type of note... but I dont really want to die... I just want to be happy. I want to be happy and live a normal fucking life like everyone else... I want my smile to be real. I want to actually want to wake up tomorrow morning and every damn morning... but I just cant...

"Im 15 and cant do it anymore. Tonight Im going to down 100 pills of Advil and jump off of the bleachers at my school. Every day is just the same boring cycle. I have no hopes or dreams for the future. It feels like every day I lose a part of myself. The world is constantly getting worse, and I know I dont want to bring a child into this world. I believe that I will be reborn somehow into a world that I cant comprehend. I told my mom that I was going to kill myself tonight, and the only thing she told me is that it will get better and if I wanted to do something today. I dont know if it is destined for me to die tonight or if she just cant even think of a reason that I should keep living. I feel like I have lost compassion for everyone,  I cant remember the last time someone has made me laugh or made me feel some strong emotion. I am so tired of everything and just want to not think anymore. Go somewhere where emotion doesnt exist. I feel so hopeless, and I dont even want to become happy anymore. I would rather just die than spend years putting in effort to make myself just feel ok again.Even if I dont die maybe this will change something. Break the cycle or do something to make my life meaningful again. Maybe tonight while Im standing at the edge of the bleachers, able to take a few steps forward and end it at any second, Ill realize something. Or maybe Ill feel nothing at all. The people that I consider friends and family probably wont even exist anymore once I die. This is just me venting my sadness and anger at everything. I know its just a bunch of depressing gibberish. Im sorry Im so selfish. ","1"
"(Throwaway account cause ppl irl know my reddit)So for the past 4 or 5 years ive just felt completely useless. I just dont see what point i have on earth. I know that the world would be fine without me, seeing how i dont have any friends in real life, and about 10 people on the internet i have to beg to talk to me.I just wish that i felt like i had a purpose. I've tried picking up hobbies, working out, talking to people, but nothing seems to help. I just feel unwanted.also i just feel like a disgusting person. I know that i have some sort of eating disorder, and it isnt good for me, but i feel like i need to keep it up. I know that i need it to stay thin.

I am content to have no human contact with anyone for the past five days. My mind is empty, almost eerily calm. It makes me wonder about disappearing from this world.

I have five years of retail experience under my belt, but I'm failing at even getting the simplest minimum wage job. I've sent out 45+ applications with little success. I've reviewed and edited my resume multiple times, I've made sincere cover letters and spoken to managers at stores, to no avail. I don't know what I'm doing wrong or what else to do.My life consists of nothing. Casting lures out to see what I can bring in, waiting anxiously for when I finally re-enter society, but it never comes. I'm rationing food, eating only sandwiches when I really need to. No money for any luxuries that make life worth living. Relying on my parents for support until I can get back on my feet, and it feels awful.

I'm failing at a life that others less fortunate would be blessed to have. At this point I just want to end it. End these feelings of powerlessness and hopelessness. End my guilt of making others work so hard to help me and letting them down again and again. It's been months of let downs and disappointment with no end in sight. I really want to change that.

"I'm bored of life and exhausted of pretending to give a shit about anything. I'm tired of all the stupidity on this planet, and I'm sick of people acting like the good outweighs the bad. It doesn't, and even if it did saying so implies that the good in the world erases the bad. I was raised by a grandmother who would get beat up by patients in a state psych ward every day just to put food on the table of a house that was literally rotting out from under us, and half the time we couldn't eat because cockroaches and other assorted bugs would get to it first. But I was somehow happy. I've never met my mother or father, they were both criminals and drug addicts. Then, somebody tried to claim my grandmother was insane which cause me to be removed from the home. The same day I was placed in another families home, people who I don't even know, and I'm told this is my new family. I didn't talk much for a few years, and when I finally did, I talked too much and was too curious so I was told to shut up and do as I was told. Fast forward from that age, which was 6, to now when I'm 20. I have been in and out of mental hospitals roughly 10 times. The last time I went I never even got out of bed and they still said i was okay to leave. I missed most of sophomore and junior years in there. I used to cut myself everyday with screwdrivers not because it gave me some sort of rush but because I truly believed my own existence was something to be punished. I wrote death notes in my own blood and became extremely delusional. I took 400mg of adderall and several thousand mg of lithium in an attempt to poison myself but it did nothing other than keeping me awake for days and heighten my anxiety. Now I'm finding out besides apparent bipolar disorder and a rare blood disease called t5 Leiden its also highly probable I have lupus. I can hardly think straight anymore and just walk around in a mental fog. Sometimes I hear things that aren't there. I don't enjoy anything anymore, I'm always in pain, and it feels like there is a hole in my chest where my feelings should be. Now all I ever feel is angry, annoyed, and completely indifferent. I feel like a monster. Sometimes I just want to crush everything that annoys me beneath my shoes and move on with my life. But at the bottom of everything, I realized something. I'm annoyed at the world because I hate myself more than anything else. I want to erase my genetic pool from this planet so that I won't be responsible for creating a child who will grow up to be in as much pain as I am constantly in. I also feel selfish for hating myself because I know there are many people who wish they could have it as good as me. I want to kill myself in a way that preserves my organs since I'm a donor. This isn't everything that's going through my head right now but it's all I can think of. Back to sleep...","1"

May God have mercy on my soul, if he exists that is I just don't know where the time went,  I was nine when I first attempted, 9 . Nothing has changed , I kinda wish it would have worked so I wouldn't leave hearts broken now, but the relief I will feel will outnumber their grief tenfold.

"So theres nothing to give you joy in life anymore, and you have decided that you want to end it all. Weve all asked or been asked a similar question to if you have ten days to live, what do you do?. This scenario has now become real. Even if you do something dangerous or illegal, you might end up kill yourself anyways? So, before you think about how depressing your life is, just lying in bed all day and night - why not seek out some last joy in life? Things youre warned not to do, do some psychedelic drugs or mdma (trust me, you dont know happiness until youve popped molly), go on a exotic trip with your last money, steal something (now dont end up in jail:)), smoke a pack of cigarettes,  go parachuting, you name it.

I don't know how i'm even existing right now.The worst part is none of this is related to my moms death, she had cancer, it got treated and everyone cared about her and helped her. I have this shit, no one cares about me, no one is there to help me, and no one will be there when I die from it. To her and everyone else i'm just faking everything and i'm a lazy bum. It should be so much easier to kill myself, but i'm a coward and can't do it, but I have to. I have no where to live, i'm not helping society at all, and I have no way to get any help. I'm just a dumb freeloader who's screaming at Minecraft because the newest Windows 10 update fucking broke it and I can't find any answers though google.why couldn't I have died of cancer instead","1"
"I've been thinking about suicide for years now as an option.I am on the autistic spectrum and have tried to kill myself before.Basically as the years go on, my friends have drifted off from me. Mainly because I feel I am too much for them and they all have relationships.The one thing that always make me think about suicide is being alone. I do not want to be one of those 40 year old men who spends all their time alone. I know for some people, that would be great for them but for me, it' a no. I'd rather just end it if I know that is going to be my life from now on.I know my issue may sound silly but hey ho.Sometimes I feel ignored by my friends and I'm starting to question if they want to even be my friend?I also have ADHD so I can get really hyperactive sometimes. Plus I am struggling job wise and I if I do not get a more permanent job soon, I'm going to have to go back and live with my parents which will cause me to be alone even more.So basically, I've decided to give myself to new years. If nothing improves and I do have to end up going back home. I'll end it, no one would care anyway since everyone ignores me. They probably won't even notice.The only reason I'm holding on for another month is to try and see if there is a light in the end of the tunnel. Here's hoping..","1"
"21 now, was probably younger than 16 when I started being depressed. I've seen therapists probably somewhere in the double digits during that time. Tried to go to college, tried to move out of my parents' house a year later, ended up stuck back here like an idiot and re-enrolling in that same school I can't afford or will feel comfortable at, just for the sake of leaving. No friends. No interests. No real goals. I live in a sea of suburbs. I'm too old to be here and my parents are too old to be supporting me. Tried to break a gaming addiction, didn't feel any better. Two older brothers who are excelling at everything they do. I must have experienced all that I can out of life. I don't want to keep living this way, there's no getting better for me.

Why do we have to be alone and deal with everything by ourselves? It shouldn't be considered weakness to ask for help.

"Im in 9th grade, and my life has took a turn for the worst.

"It feels like Im already dead, on the inside. Everything I read about suicide always seems to regurgitate the same old talking points about how theres so much to live for, people care, you matter, all the same old bullshit.To start out with, I like myself. I think Im an awesome individual. Im funny, intelligent, talented. I think I have a lot to offer in terms of either friendship and/or romance to someone else. And thats where it stays, in my head.I dont ever feel accepted by anyone. I dont think anyone ever gives me a fair chance. Thats not to say I think people are actively or rudely rejecting me, I dont believe that all. Im not socially awkward, at least not that much, as I deal with the public all day long in my work and have developed some great social skills. With women, they see the red flags early and run away. I cant blame them, I am damaged goods. Thats not a put down on myself or anything, Ive got severe emotional and mental problems. None of them are manifested by lashing out on others and is all internalized, but its enough to be noticed. Despite the tremendous strides I've made in overcoming a lot. Thats fair enough. In more platonic scenarios I just dont click, I cant connect. I dont think like anyone else, Im never on the same wavelength with people.Im atypical and trying to explain that to anyone else only comes across as pretentious or prick-ish, that I believe Im better in some way. I dont believe Im better than anyone else, at all. In fact, I wish I were more like everyone else and fit into societys mold of normal. Even a subcultures mold of normal would be great, because then at least I could find a social belonging somewhere. I dont belong anywhere.Ive tried, I really have. Putting myself out there only makes me feel more alienated than I do by just staying shut in. It could be argued that Im not getting outside of my comfort zone enough, but Ive done that. It always ends the same. One more rejection, one more small push could be the one to really put me over the edge into taking my own life.Im hypersensitive, again not externally, no one would ever know. But inside, I feel every last detail of every emotion that churns its way through my innards. Maybe I have bad coping skills, but I dont drink, smoke, or cut anymore. Havent done any of those things for years, but here I still am unable to cope in complete sober awareness. I have no desire to go back into any of those.Its this lack of belonging in my utter lonely and touch starved state, with not a single prospect of it ever changing anytime soon, that brings my mind back to suicide over and over.Its a selfish act, completely selfish. It will devastate my family and long-lost friends (as of now I have no friends). Ive tried about 10 different therapists in the past 10yrs, Ive gone through about just as many psychiatric pharmaceuticals if not more (Im pretty sure its more).Im not a lost cause, Im just an unknown and un-helpable one. The system has failed me, this world has broken me.Im in line for a promotion at work that Im probably going to get. My income will be greater than it is now. Ill have more financial independence.None of that matters. Im giving myself until the end of the year. Im going to try therapy one more time cause I get 5 free sessions through my insurance. Its my last effort, but theres a very high probability I will be dead by early next year.I never wanted or asked for sympathy and I dont want it now. I was meant to be alone, but designed not to be. I cant live with that and I wont.","1"

"I can't feel my face. And not in a good way. In a scary way.It's hard for me to even find the energy to write this, but I think it will help some people...I just came out of an intense psychosis or something like that. I have these sometimes, but this one was really bad.My head is pounding because I've been in bed the majority of days for most of this past month, and I just came out of intense crying episodes relentlessly all day today. These were so extreme, I almost reverted back to a childlike state. I think it's because when I was little I was constantly subjected to different forms of prolonged abuse, and also I was never allowed to cry, and I was berated or punished for even crying the slightest and most harmless amount, so now, it all comes out x1000. This one was really gnarly. My body went hot with rage. Literally my temperature. It was strange. My wailing and whimpering came in waves, and took on different sounds. But it was another horrible episode, and now I am a mess and I feel completely gutted/drained.Does anyone know what to do immediately after your body goes through something so intense and traumatic like this, to speed up the recovery time a little?I can't remember the last time I had water and sometimes I only get out of bed to pee.So, on top of that, I'm dehydrated.The only thing that made it a little less agonizing was to get into the fetal position, because for many hours before that, I was just numb and my aching body was lying there in a very unnatural position and I was really tense and felt paralyzed.These don't solve the actual suicidal, hopeless, life is meaningless feelings of pain and extreme depression that I have. But here are my immediate go-to's after I go off the deep end badly like this:How do you pick yourself up after something so emotionally and mentally disturbing and awful, and try to restore some normalcy?I am trying to stay safe tonight. I am trying to take it one breath at a time: deep breaths hot tea, or water, if you can try to get something down maybe a hot shower, if you have access to one try to reduce your triggers, if at all possible In my case, I may need an ice pack or cold compress to the head because if anybody knows what it's like to be an intense crier (especially during an acute panic attack), you have a throbbing headache and possibly blurred vision that may not go away for a few hours. I might just try to tough it out naturally, but a pain reducing med might be essential in moments like these Try not to beat yourself up or feel ashamed for your depression. You will have to pick yourself up and try to tackle everything, but not all at once. Maybe just starting with something to soothe or comfort yourself. maybe you can talk to someone close (unless that triggers you, in which case I would advise you to just be by yourself)Really, just taking care of yourself and trying to keep yourself safeI'm a hypocrite in some ways. I can't follow my own advice. I live in a tiny space with my father, and he is here right now, so I am afraid to even get up to get water. So I go thirsty. And it's painful, but I will wait for 24 hours and maybe he'll leave and then I can get up. It's like sending a kitten into a cage with a grizzly bear. I just can't do it.My anxiety is so bad, some days I cannot bring myself to take out the trash. That's not a joke. People with severe anxiety issues will understand what I mean. So then it piles up... which fucks with my O.C.D., and then it's a million times worse.This is how I know I'm not in a healthy place. My mindset is really fucked up. I'm harming myself. So please, don't be stupid like me. Hydrate yourself.And ideally, you should try not to let these feelings build for so long, that it escalates into this. It was a miserable, awful, horrible, physically painful experience, and I don't want anyone to go through what I just went trough. This wasn't my first time and it won't be my last. But I'm going to try to feel better, now. Even though it feels impossible. I could feel myself slipping into that dark, scary place for a few weeks now, with a few mellow days here and there, but mostly just a painful minimal existence... It's important to try to change the direction of things before you start heading into crisis-mode. (Gee, now if only I could take my own advice).When I eventually get around to cleaning myself up and feeling stable, I might go see about getting a prescription for my anxiety, because I've taken them in the past a few times and I do believe they can work. Sometimes, on my own is not enough. Sometimes I can't fight these evil thoughts feelings, they literally take control. And then they take full control of my life. And I don't want that. I want to be the one behind the wheel in my life.If you have anything to add that you think is useful, or if you have any similar experience with this, tips, maybe a relapse story...anything relevant...let us know. Let's help each other out here. I don't want anyone to go through this, it made me feel like I was metaphorically being buried alive. So, please. Let's break the cycle, starting now...I hope no one is in as dark of a place as me right now. Please don't sabotage your success like I do. The results are devastating.We can't help that we were born, and even though we may hate this fact, let's try to feel okay right now and start to make a tiny, positive change...(22-year old U.S. female for reference)","1"

"My son tried to commit suicide last night. He took a box cutter and sliced deep four or five times on one arm and three or four times on the other. Then he laid down in a bathtub full of water but then got out and went to his bedroom where he passed out.He'd made an odd call to his sister that worried her, so before she called 911, she called me, and I rushed home from work as she called 911 and dealt with them.When I got home, there was an ambulance and a fire engine and several police cars. My daughter saved his life. Now he's in the hospital and will be transferred to a psych unit for awhile to deal with the deep depression he was under and that he hid but it all came out last night as I sat by his hospital bed and thanked God that my son was alive.I lost my second daughter as an infant when she was just seven months old. I cannot take this again.I have no idea what to do now. I have to be strong for my kids but all I can do from now on is worry any time I don't know that he's being watched. I have to go into work now and tell my boss what happened and that I probably have to work from home once my son is released.When I got home from the hospital last night I had to clean up all the blood that was all over the house. Anything his blood touched I  threw away. I scrubbed the bathroom and his bedroom. I threw away the boxcutter he used. I will never be able to forget the sight of his blood everywhere.","1"

"During Thanksgiving I was told that one of my cousins (early twenties) had just been in the hospital after overdosing on a large amount of painkillers. But the people who pulled me aside to tell me about it all said that it was an drunken accident.  I did not believe them and so I messaged her about how I've struggled with depression and I'm here if they need anyone to talk to.  I also said that I saw a doctor and therapist in college and found an antidepressant that's helped me out and that if they wanted to find someone to talk to or had any questions that I could help.They responded and didn't really confirm that it was a suicide attempt but didn't deny the implication either, and said that it meant a lot to them and that they had been considering talking to a doctor and maybe trying medication again, and that they would message me if they want help with anything.Is there anything else I should say/do? We are not very close, my family usually only sees and talks to each other at holiday gatherings.  So I feel like if I start texting her then she will feel like I am trying to keep an eye on her and be annoyed. Also, I am confused about the situation because the rest of my relatives tried to tell me it was an accident, but I am not sure if they actually believe that. Her father didn't seem to act any different, and asked me to drive my cousin to her apartment afterward which I found odd because I would think that if he knew she was suicidal then he would have wanted to have more time to talk to her and make sure she was okay and got home alright. Or would have wanted her to stay with relatives or something so that she wasn't alone. I am unsure if I should talk to them and let them know that I think it was a suicide attempt, or if they already know and are trying to hide it?If anyone has any advice please post. I don't really have any experience in this situation.  I read the talking tips and assessment guide on the right, but since we aren't close I'm unsure if trying to talk to her more would be good or not.","1"
"The title explains it all.  This is not a manifesto, but a statement of truth.  I have had it with my life.  I should never have been born.  I am lonely and broke in mind, spirit, and finances.  I am tired of lying, hiding what I really am.  A broke, jobless, middle-aged loser, who has never moved out, who constantly lied about who and what he really is.  It doesn't matter how hard I try to change, I am condemned.  My life now will not get better, only killing myself will solve this problem.  I want to kill myself, to die honorably, to say to ""fuck you God"" for the waste of life I am/was while I pull the trigger.  I was and I am and I will be a coward.  I want to kill myself with my father's sidearm, one more casualty for the Major.  I want to punish my parents for not pushing me, for not giving a damn, I want them to experience the consequences of failure.  And you know what, screw those who were and are foolish enough to know me.  I should have died and mom and dad, while they were still together, should have had the son or daughter they wanted to have.  When I am dead, I want to be destroyed, burned in fire.  Burned in fire and serving in hell is far better than being in paradise with the people who made me.  Everyday I am alive is just plain fucking misery.

I wake up with tears shortly before walking to my bathroom and see my face that looks like it was run through a fucking meat grinder as I brush my teeth just to remind myself why it is just a dream and probably won't ever be a reality.","1"
"Everyone has their own reasons, but today my main reason is just to be out of pain. I've been in pain for over a decade and it's killing me. Sometimes I don't think I will be able to make it through until tomorrow morning. Life was supposed to be so much more than this. Life really let me down. I cry for five hours straight sometimes. I write suicide notes in my head a couple times a day. Sometimes I cry to the point where I have to throw up, or dry heave, or I can hardly breathe. I cry out of intense physical and emotional pain. I can't imagine a future where I have to feel like this for another year, much less another decade... it's just too much. I cry because I hate (my) life. I cry out of frustration and stress. I do have the revenge fantasy sometimes, that maybe, you know, once I'm dead, they'll get it. Everyone who hurt me in this life will finally believe me and see that what I was going through was real and maybe some of them would take it seriously. But that can be a really dangerous/harmful thought, that can feed more suicidal/extreme depressive thoughts and behavior. I want to die because I have run out of strategies to deal with life.","1"

"This is just not working. I'm 26, have been depressed for years now, and always tried to work and think my way through it. Suicide has come up in my mind before, but I've always been convinced that there was some option that I haven't tried.I'm not so convinced anymore. I have no family to go to where I can be myself, I have a personality that hurts other people, and I haven't been able to change my personality for all the years that I've tried. It seems to be in the best interest of everyone that I just disappear. Even the friends that still do care about me - if I keep going on, they'll just get estranged by my lack of communication and maybe wonder what has happened to me as a side thought, years from now.My main emotion during adolescence was hatred of myself for what i am (parents told me being gay was horrible and gays should die, said they'd rather have one of their kids die than have them leave their religion. a few years later, i came out as gay and told them i don't believe in god) - after that, hatred towards my parents for making me feel that way.

Had an appointment with the psychological services department with the university, but due to a mess up on their end, I could not get help and now have to wait till next semester due to their short availability schedule.The thing is, I will never kill myself because I appreciate the love and effort and energy that my parents gave me too much to be able to cause them a loss.

"This subreddit is very quiet, but I don't think my question would be allowed in /r/AskReddit. /r/AskCanadian subreddit is very quiet too. I hope someone knowledgeable can help me. Please correct me if I'm wrong. When you attempt suicide in Canada and police or paramedics are called, this event is recorded in the Canadian Police Information Centre (CPIC) database (as well as any relevant local police and medical databases). From googling, I've found out that consequences include: 1. I won't been able to get a firearms license (a wise restriction). 2. I probably won't be able to [travel to] (https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2011/01/29/canadian_woman_denied_entry_to_us_because_of_suicide_attempt.html) or through the USA (suicide attempts can be recorded in the Canadian Police Information Centre database, which is [somewhat] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Police_Information_Centre) [accessible] (http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/windsor/canadians-mental-health-info-routinely-shared-with-fbi-u-s-customs-1.2609159) by the FBI and U.S. Customs and Border Protection). If a person attempts suicide, recovers, and is able to become mentally healthy and live a normal life, what other permanent negative consequences are there? Can insurance companies dig up this information? (Affecting extended private health, life, or even auto insurance eligibility?) Will prospective employers be able to find this through background checks? Will mental health history be covered in the Canadian Government Security Screening? I mean, will you be treated like a convicted criminal, not allowed to work with confidential information (like someone who helps do your taxes or a medical office assistant), transport medical supplies (like insulin or donated blood), or transport hazardous materials (like a freight truck driver transporting a load of pool cleaning supplies)? Security screening focuses on your [reliability] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_clearance#Canada). I can't find specific mention of mental health, but I think that can be considered a significant factor of a person's reliability. I also don't know the negative long term consequences of having ""suicidal thoughts"" or ""involuntary hospitalization"" in my medical record. Will this also hurt my ability to get a job or insurance? I'm afraid to admit to anyone that I've seriously considered killing myself. I don't want to be involuntarily locked up for [three months] (https://www.legalline.ca/legal-answers/involuntary-hospital-admission-of-mentally-ill-people-and-length-of-stay/) or more.  Years ago I had a psychotherapist who just kept prescribing different drugs which left me feeling extremely detached, unable to concentrate on anything, and a lot of other side effects (like dry mouth). I don't want that again. I hated those drugs.  I had a very difficult time finding a psychotherapist who seemed right for me. I hesitate to say this, but I found some of them very unprofessional: one spent all of our sessions asking me technical computer questions and essentially getting paid to pester me as his personal IT support person (he was the drug pusher); another was working hard on an academic thesis with a really narrow focus which he forcefully tried to apply to all of our therapy sessions whether it made sense or not. He would ignore any patient problems or issues if they were not dream related and can also be drawn on paper. He adamantly refused to do anything else. I couldn't make this up if I tried.  All of this turned me off of therapy for years. Canadian healthcare might be better than in the United States in some ways, but there's a lot of flaws and problems, too. In recent days I had been having increasingly frequent suicidal thoughts, but so far it's gone down and I've been holding steady. I managed to find a relative to talk to. Not a resolution or even a reliable source of support, but it's pulled me back from the edge. Also, finding [this] (https://www.camh.ca/en/hospital/health_information/a_z_mental_health_and_addiction_information/suicide/Pages/default.aspx) web page at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (Canada) helped. It's slender comfort, but where the page explains why and ""Who is at risk?"" and ""What are the warning signs?"" - it was like a brief warm sunbeam because whoever wrote that web page understood exactly how I feel. Thank you for taking the time to read all this. I hope someone can answer my questions. How screwed am I if there are records of me having attempted suicide, or being locked up in a hospital, or even admitting that I wanted to die?","1"

Im okayIm okay, a thousand times more I say to myself.The peaceful repetition attempts to soothe my being, fighting back against the crashing waves of would-be tears.The tide swells and calms, slowly eroding the bedrock of my faux defenses, and I crumble to the ground.Im sorryIm sorry, a thousand times more I cry out.The words tiptoe to your ear in vain, as the burning eruption of your anger turns them to ash.The molten rage slams into my ocean of tears, and encompasses me in a cage of obsidian.Clawing back at your rage I try to hold on, but the heat is too much to hold on to, and I being to sink.DownDown I fall farther into the abyss of my own sorrow. Searching for hope I close my eyes and try to remember your beautiful face,And the smile it once had for me. But its gone.  ","1"

"I just wish I wasnt born. I have 3 sisters aged 6,8, and 19. How could I leave my 6 and 8 year old sisters that I pick up from school and play with every day with the burden of me just one day being gone and not understanding why. I just want to not exist in this world, I feel trapped. My 19 year old sister has depression and bipolar disorder. She's cut her wrists and wants to run away. She only tells me this and forces me to tell nobody.  I'm scared of her. I have dreams that she loses her mind and kills me. I dont sleep at night anymore. I hate school and im always tired. My friends are all smart and want to be engineers but I can't fucking pass a grade 11 math test. Im 16 in grade 11 and I fucking hate every day of school. I pretend to be sick so I can skip it. I can't drop out because my dad would lose it. I cant commit suicide because my mom already thinks she's failed as a parent because of my older sister's doings.  My parents put all their effort into my eldest sister because I keep all this inside of me. Ive told them and they did 2 counselling sessions before my dad cut them off because he thought I was doing it for attention and was faking it. They don't believe me. They put all resources into helping her and I've been neglected. I hate them. If my two younger sisters were not in the equation I would instantly kill myself. I even have a note written on my laptop containing how to help explain suicide to young kids. Alongside a will in which everything goes to my friends and younger sisters. I'm trapped. Trapped in this shitty life where I have no joy, no happiness. I keep everything inside of me and I only can tell my friends. I just want to get hit by a car so that I can die and it can be an accident. Tbh I don't even know why I'm writing this. Or how I got here. I was researching the most efficient ways to die. I don't want to waste any space if I ever work up the guts to leave this shitty world and take my life. I just wish life didn't kick you to the ground and keep kicking you. Like fuck man I just want to die. I just want whatever this world is to not contain me. I wish it was like an immune system and I was an infection and it flushed me out. I'm trapped it this paradox where I can't but I want to so bad. I hate my younger sisters because they're keeping me alive but love them because they are keeping me alive. I know that made no sense to whoever read this far into my jumbled mess of thoughts and self loathing, but to me it does. I wish my parents would take me out of school for a week or two so I can just mentally try heal and reset. I'm in danger at school because I want to die the most there. I could so easily just run away and finish it. And I'm so goddamn tempted to. To be honest I know deep deep down I dont want to die, and I believe that exists in all of us or at least most of us. That's why as I write this I wish that someone somehow on the internet sees the name mojoit and goes ""oh hey that's one of my friends' aliases. I'm going to contact 911 for him so that they can stop this."" But that feeling deep deep down is not nearly enough to save me. Ive called out to my parents many times and they ignored it or did not take it serious enough. Maybe they just didn't know what I meant. I hate my dad the most. I wish he saw this so that he knew. We are too different. He wants me to be this lawyer savant but I will never be. He sees me as so inferior to everyone and he embarrasses me. Just the other day we were at a family dinner and he made fun of me for dropping soccer and dance due to my anxiety around it. My mom forces me to do dance in school so that I wont get fat but I hate it. I have a performance tomorrow and because I pretended to be sick I don't know the dances. This is pushing me more and more to dying tonight. I know my dad will comment on how bad I did and my mom will be disappointed. I have friends in Calgary that I met online that in just want to go meet cause they have been so important to me so that way if I kill myself I would have met them in person. (im in Vancouver BC) I don't know why I wrote this. Maybe because of that feeling I talked about earlier. Who knows. All I know is that maybe tonight is the night. There's bleach upstairs and tons of meds I could take. I dont want to make a mess and go the gory knife rought. Too much for my parents to clean up. I'm trapped reddit. I just want to never have existed. Now I'm stuck with having to work up the courage to commit. I just wish my parents understood. I'm trapped. ","1"

"I don't know what happened. Last friday, I went to get drinks with some friends, and I told them ""I'm better because I don't see suicide as an option anymore, I want to live"". And last night everything went to shit. I don't see any other possible solution that isn't suicide. I've tried everything; therapy, medication, doing yoga, talking to my friends, everything. But the pain and suffering is just too much.The only problem is I feel like my survival instinct is too strong and when I commit suicide, something is going to kick in on me and I might regret it at the last moment, which will make me survive and that would be HORRENDOUS. I do not want to be on an hospital sorrounded with people crying because I tried to take my own life. I don't want to be there when people are suffering. I wish I had hope still. I had it until days ago, when I realized there's no cure. My life is going to be like this forever. I have my happy moments, yeah, but they're always tinted with darkness and pain.

"Starting last month I finally realised all of my problems could be traced back to my depression. For aslong as I can remeber, I have hated myself. I believe I have untreated adhd which has lead to a lifetime of mistakes, procrastination and laziness. One month ago I lost my job, and for those weeks it felt like the smallest weight was lifted from my shoulders. Now my friend got me a job and I'm supposed to start in a few hours. Tonight I had all the weight come crashing back down. The reality that I need to work to live, but trying to work while feeling like this brings me tremendous anxiety. I finally tried it tonight... I have always been anti suicide and thought no matter how bad things got I would never attempt. But something changed. I didn't think much about it, I just tied my belt to my door and slid it over my neck and let myself fall. I hung for a few seconds, just long enough to start to pass out and I decided to sit up. I panicked as I struggle to try and get the belt off of me. Then I just sat there and hyperventilated like I have never experienced. I couldn't get a breath it felt like. I don't k ow what made me try it, or what made me stop. I am so confused and don't k ow what to do. I'm supposed to start soon, but all I want is to lay in bed. I know I should seek help but don't know where to start. If I try to work I don't think I can do it, but I don't want to let my friend down or my new employer. What do I do?

"4 months ago, I felt so down. I felt as if someone put gravity on the highest level and I was bringing pulled into that ground. Constant thoughts of suicide followed me everywhere. Work, school, when I was alone at night. I knew how bad it was getting and how badly I wanted it...instead I got help. The reason being was seeing everyone's reaction after being sent to the mental health hospital. There was so much good vibes around me it inspired me. Also everyone at the hospital especially inspired me...there are people out that who are good and who only want to help.When I got out, I started seeing a therapist and taking medication. I also started doing things for myself more. Not going out as much, binge watching good shows, reading, learning new recipes. Your own company is the best and it's been the best for the last four months.Also I quit drinking and I've never regretted that decision.It gets better friends, hold in there :)","1"

"I'm 14 and I just went into high school. I'm not that good in looks pretty fat tbh and people are already spreading false rumours about me. I went to a new high school with none of my prev friends so I only had like 6 I am socially awkward too so it's even harder and I have a lot of anxiety. ( they weren't even really friends cuz I didn't have there social media or anything we just like talked because we had no one else to talk to and all) and people are already spreading false rumours about me. so school isn't really that great. My teachers hate me (Atleast 3/4 of them) and my mom just made everything worse putting a note in my AGENDA (highschool and you still use your agenda??) saying please sign his agenda everyday and make sure he puts his work and stuff on it. So I get bullied for that too (looks, grades too and for using my agenda like  a pre-schooler) So that's my life at school and already feel suicidal about them then my mom makes it like 40 times worse but I don't want it to get too long but she puts me to the edge of suicide like saying I'm a nuisance not needed a waste of space and money and all. And so when I go to sleep I'm always super depressed and suicidal so I just think of ways of suiciding like a noose or like shooting myself when my mom gets home from work (sadly I don't have a rope or a gun though) and I think of a death note like. Finally that nuisance is out of your life or, looks like a different jackass  died (because my bro has cancer and she calls everyone a jackass) and like I finally did something you wanted for once!

Id found out so much about myself, I dated around a bit for the first time in 3 years, I saw a therapist for the first time, a new semester was starting, for the first time in my life Id made music I was proud of, and Id gotten closer to some friends Id neglected. It felt like things were going to be okay and I could actually get by on my own.Then the semester REALLY started. Then I got let go from my job. Then I met her.I failed an exam one day but thought, you know its okay you can work your way out of this. Youve done it before, youre smart right?. Then I failed another one. Then after spending day after day studying without working enough deliveries (I drive as a courier), I started running out of money from loans and savings. But I thought, its okay, i have until the end of the month. School is most important.I thought I would be able to be so successful if I tried and now its a daily struggle to even try. I dont know that Im cut out for computer science, but I dont know what I could do otherwise. Im already 4 years deep into school on sheer loans and grants that are going to run out soon enough. My family doesnt have money. But what am I supposed to do? Work at another call center thats brought me just as close to feeling suicidal as having no money? I get so many collections calls daily from credit card debt I accumulated while I was recovering from heart failure and every one of them just brings all the anxiety rushing back if I had managed to escape it for a moment.Top it all off with this girl. Extremely smart STEM graduate who I can finally speak to eye level after having only dated people well over a foot shorter than me. Weve been on the same page on so many things I never even considered before as important and its like she just GETS IT. Every time Im around her its like I can be comfortable in my own skin and god the sex is fucking unbelievable. I dont have sex casually with people like weve had. It feels so different but she doesnt want a boyfriend right now. And I get it. I wanted to date around too. But the more I date around the more I find that Id rather just be with her. But she doesnt want that and so all I can do is just let the inner feelings of inadequacy take over and wonder why Im not good enough. I told her I could be okay with not being her boyfriend, but Im just not. But I cant bring myself to end it because that means I cant see her again and that sounds equally as bad.And so all of that just compounds on each other and Ive just never felt like such shit. My friends arent around like they used to be, and I cant keep bothering them with yet another crisis because I cant just keep my shit together for a week. I feel like a failure in every sense because even if I try to tell myself I can get better or Ive been working hard so its okay, its all just a lie because all I can do anymore is sit paralyzed by the depression and anxiety thats stuck with me about every aspect of my life.And so Ive reached a point where I cant distract myself anymore or pretend my life isnt slowly falling apart. Rent is due in days and I have no money. The semester ends next week and I have no idea if Ill even pass half my classes. Ive just had it. I dont want to wake up and feel like dying anymore. I dont want to sit in bed at night wishing I even had tears to cry because Im so fucking numb to whats happening around me.And all of that said I havent even touched on the fact that I lost my best friend in the breakup and I have no one who really can even hear me out or empathize with any of this in my life. Ive always just been the _____ guy. Be it the tall guy, the synth guy, the weeb Guy, the weed guy. No one knows me as the person I am as a whole and god I miss that level of understanding so much.At this point this is just incoherent rambling. So if youve made it this far, thanks i guess... I just dont know what to do anymore.TLDR: boo hoo, Im poor, dumb, heartbroken, lonely, and depressed. My problems are so unique boo hoo","1"
"I feel so selfish posting here. I try replying to some heartfelt posts on here sometimes. Idk. I'm sorry, I don't exactly know why I'm posting this, I guess it just makes me feel like I'm still alive you know? I just feel so empty and worthless all the time. Being scared of connecting with people doesn't help. Many months go by without me speaking to a soul. I love people and the good they do, I love this planet, but I'm starting to lose the will and desire to go on. Everything seems so pointless. There's this someone who I've been neglecting and she's the only real reason why I'm still holding on. I'm so tired. I can't think straight. Thanks for reading. Wish you all the best. ","1"
"Really its torturous and there are zero positives to keep me going. Hope of recovery is non-existent, I lost my dignity a long time ago. After being forced to stay stuck at home  being miserable and sick ever single day for the last 3 years the world forgot me, my friends, and so did my family. I am in constant pain, I constantly think of the horrible death thats waiting for me at the end and I just...dont want it. If I had any reason to stay, any reason to be happy I would not want to end my suffering now. But I am completely alone. I spend all day in bed or just walk around the house playing with my dog, and constantly watching videos on YouTube as my only source of human contact because I can not physically do any more without getting very sick. This is it for me. No one is coming to my rescue. I have 1 friend that sticks around, but really I have no friends. I know my family is always around, but my family is probably almost as responsible for my death as my terrible doctors or myself. If I had any reason to endure this horrifying pain, the slow death of a collapsing body, failing organs, insanely difficult breathing, joint pains, now death, I would. I would try at least. I dont want to die, I never wanted to die. I was happy before I got sick, everything was taken from me, the last 3 1/2 years of my life stolen and forced into this hell. I just dont want to suffer anymore, but I want to live more then anything. I dont want my only human contact to be watching people on YouTube or Netflix.TO answer some question, I dont have anything going for me. I have spent 3 1/2 years homebound in this slow boiling hell, there was no chance to make friends when you can't leave your bed. Any other friends I had were lost when I had no choice but to stay stuck at home or in bed because I could no longer take care of myself. In the last 3 years I have been taken to the emergency 7 times because things got really bad, and one time an ambulance droveup to my door because I was suffocating so badly that it felt like my chest was going to explode and felt like I was breathing through a sponge. As a matter of time, I already accepted the fact that I will live a short miserable life. There is no exact number on it, but yeah. I can die any day now, it would be horrifying, probably suffocation or organ failure. If i was lucky I hope to die peacefully in my sleep. At least then I wouldnt have to deal with the terrible pains of my body failing.I am 21 years old. I used to have passions. I loved life. I had a passion for learning, reading, educating myself, art, photography, music, games, exploration. Now...I spend most of the day taking care of my dog, exchanging icepacks from my freezer to keep my fever down, and wishing I wasnt suffering so bad that I could sleep the days away, so I would not have to be awake through this misery. The pain keeps me awake though, every day, all day. Watching people on social media having fun & enjoying life reminds me of how my life is nothing but filled with shit and misery.I wish I had the courage to end it. I have spent so many nights telling myself over and over, that its my only option. That I must do it. But I can't break that barrier, yet. I decided I would rather go out with some kind of control, then wait until there is nothing but agony, to make my death even more horrifying.These days...I dont know if I could even have company honestly. Its simple things like watching a movie with someone, or even having someone in the same room as me that I miss the most. Its been years since I can remember being genuinely happy. Now I wake up everyday being more hopeless than the day before. I cant even remember the last time I was excited to wake up in the morning and look forward to anything. Its been years since I had hung out with friends or have any real human contact. In the last 2 years I have wasted so much of my Little time and energy I got meeting more doctors than anyone should in 1 whole life time & now I would rather die than go waste any more of my little  time & energy I got left going to another doctor ever again.","1"
"I had depression since I was 13 yrs. Old. I was diagnosed at that age as well. It all started with a flick of a rubber band until it slowly becomes red. I always had anxiety to do public speaking and never actually do anything right. At 15 I started to think that the meds they gave me for years wasn't really working. I caused a lot of problems for my family that what I'm thinking right now is to just end their suffering as well as mine. Currently I have a lot of cuts around my body and not just my wrists. My doctor knew I wasn't really going to be cured with just meds and so the therapies began. I think talking to the guidance counselor is a therapy but I kept thinking I'm causing trouble for them so I keep cutting. I can't stop. I know I'm weak. I know that I can't stop doing it. Everyone will be better off without me, right? ","1"
"I'm in college now. As time went on, my nihilism just started to increase, and it's reached a high point. I started to get depressed in HS and I thought that being in college would help me with my problems. But nothing has changed. In fact, the shift in responsibility to me to do everything on my own as resulted in my imminent failure in a bunch of courses. My therapist is helping very, very slightly.To tell the truth, I don't want to be in college. I don't want to work. I don't want to talk to people that much anymore. I don't watch anime or play video games as much as I did in HS. Food has started to taste terrible to me, so I don't enjoy eating anymore like I used to. Nothing is enjoyable. There's nothing to look forward to, except death. I'm going to die one day anyways. Why should I keep delaying it?I don't have a life goal. I can't find one. No one will give me one. I should just kill myself. I have anti-depressants, so I've been thinking that maybe I can swallow them all at once. I can't do anything that I want to do as of right now (which is mainly just to lose my virginity), so at some point coming up, I'm just going to kill myself.","1"

I constantly tell people they're young and they'll find someone. There are a lot of people out there. It's just not happening for me.

"Seems that if I didnt have family, no one would give a shit if I killed myself. It sucks when I see so many people hanging out, and having a social life, and I dont. Its not from a lack of trying. Ive tried to talk to people, and get their contact info, and whenever I talk to them, its always me starting up the conversation. A few months ago, I was a lifeguard, one co worker who was really the only one would I didnt have to start the conversation with, him and I made plans to go out on eat on a Monday. We invited two other people to join. Well that day came, and the plan never happened. And all day I was waiting for them message. It never came. I was too afraid to message the co worker about it because I knew what the response would be. Then later I ask someone else to see if they wanted to hang out three times, and each time they couldnt do it. And I havent asked again because I dont want to go through the pain of getting the same response again. Countless times Ive tried to hang out with people, and countless times, I failed. And I just stopped messaging people, because they never messaged me first. If I just died. No one would noticed. I just feel like no one likes me. It hurts me so much. I wish I had people to hang out with or people who at least message me first. But I guess not. ","1"
"Im completely lost and have no direction any more. I feel trapped and like theres no way forward left. I have no reason to get out of bed in the morning, and no comforting thoughts to help me sleep at night. Im just going through the motions. I have been for years. I daydream of ways to end my life without anyone realizing, so I can simply slip away into the past and never return.I've been self destructive for most of my adult life, I had a rough childhood, bad family relations, social isolation. I was perpetually a loser when i was younger. I did a big turnaround and became one of the most popular guys in my high school, very successful with the ladies, good at sports, academically successful. But I always hated myself. I totally bought into blue pill, thought i'd find that missing piece in my life when I found the right woman. My unicorn destroyed me. I almost dropped out of college. Became an alcoholic. My life at that point was in the dumpsters.Everyone suddenly seemed to hate me. I worked in a supermarket stacking boxes in the basement for a year while I finished up school. My coworkers mocked me, I avoided everyone I knew. I hated the condition of my life, and I resolved to change. I became a stoic and red pilled hard. Stopped drinking, path to recovery. Did another big turnaround that took several years to execute. Took some big risks. 4 years later I peaked, working in a very prestigious industry, good money, great career path with the opportunity to make millions within 10 years. Suddenly I was the man again, it felt great. People came back into my life, men suddenly reappeared and treated me with less condescension, women from the past who snubbed me due to my poor career prospects (we fucked, but they didn't want to stick around with this loser) reconnected with me as well. I didn't take them very seriously though. I still held on to the hope that I'd find my perfect lady and that would finally fill that hole in my heart. Being red pilled, I put all my soul and hope into my job, knowing that this is the way to have it all. The company fell apart. I'm now totally broke. I do have career prospects, but I don't have the heart to carry on anymore. I'm just so empty inside.I don't see the point. I don't think anything can fill that void I think I'm fundamentally just broken inside, always have been. I can't think of any way to put one foot in front of the next and carry on striving and hoping and dreaming. At this point I'd need to do another turn around, but I'll never get back to where I was just not too long ago. I don't know if I have the heart to pull it all together and push forward any longer, and do another turn around. In fact, i think I don't.I've reached this point where I might just be happier accelerating my demise by a handful of decades. I've got enough cash to rent a truck, drive out to the middle of the Gobi desert, and drink a couple aspirin boxes with a bottle of whiskey or 10 beers, or both, and just disappear from existence.Its just all so empty now. I don't know what to do, I've got no one I can turn to. This feeling in my heart these days isn't just today, its always, it might even be a core feature of my personality.I just don't have any reason to keep doing this every day. I don't know what I'm expecting to get from posting here, but just want to share it with you all, get it off my chest. Let someone witness me. ","1"

"Im a few months clean. I get really severe urges every once in a while, but have been able to take care of them this past stint due to the SH pics sub. A lot of it is about the blood for me so being able to see that in pictures without inflicting it on myself is usually enough. It makes my heart hurt that other people are injuring themselves, but it helps me stay clean. Reaching out to people on there and offering support has also helped me stay clean.

"About a year ago I ruined my life. I went to school shitfaced every single day due to extreme social anxiety and depression. Little did i know, my life would only get 100x worse when i got caught. getting driven to this hospital to get my stomach pumped, getting picked up my dad broke my families heart. They let me go back to school a weak later and i was so happy to see all my friends and return to my passion: violin (it was a performing arts school). although i got past substance abuse, my depression continued to grow, and during winter break my parents found my finsta which had all my personal information and feelings on it on my mental health and sexuality and it was very embarassing due to the fact that i wasnt ready to come out. They made me switch schools to a closer one and promised i could return to my old school after i got better. By April, my mentality improved and my therapist said i was good to go back but my parents didnt even try. Im now still stuck in this god awful school in which i cannot truly call anyone my friend. All my friends from my old school have lost contact with me. My parents emotionally abuse me and my sisters every day and they all have an escape with their friends and boyfriends at school but for me life has become one tomultuos torture. I work hard every day to please my parents by practicing violin, working on my grades and losing weight but it is never enough for them. every day i tell myself that once this year is over ill be in college and ill have my own life with new friends and some sort of partner but i cant fucking live this awful cycle one more day. I havent been sober to school in over a month, i smoke my wax pen in the bathroom every single day because i cant stand existing anymore. I havent told one person in my school about who i truly am or anything and everyone else is in a relationship or at least has a fucking friend. I cant fucking hold this in anymore. school is hell home is hell sleep is hell im going to end this awful existence on the anniversary of the day i ruined my life. i keep telling my self it will be better next year, but i also said that last year and now im more suicidal than ive ever been in my liife.

"I will send this thread to her later.She has been depressed since just before her teenage years. She is currently 20 years old. Her depression started when her parents had problems as a couple and they seperated for multiple years. Her dad cheated on her mom aswell.Yesterday things got very bad, and luckily I was on the phone with her. She wanted and tried to end the call, in order to go through with it, but I kept her on the phone, while calling 911. Eventually the police came and took her to the hospital.She is now told by the psychiatrist that she'll be transferred to a mental hospital, as she is a danger to herself. She's scared to be in a mental hospital, she doesn't know for how long, and is very stressed out (to say the least) about this whole thing. Could you please give her some good words, insights and perspective to how this could actually be positive for her?I'm lucky enough to not have depression so its sometimes hard for me to relate.

"i'm pretty sure mines justifiable. but i just need to mostly vent about my problem, since i suffer silently from it. as a warning, this is pretty explicit.im 20 years old. ive always been healthy, went to the gym often and what not. very active and usually full of life, albeit not a social butterfly. earlier this year i was basically at my prime. happy, finally having a social life, going out with friends, fuckin girls. until 5 months ago i countered a yeast infection because i was too stupid to wear condoms. i'm supposed i'm std free. so i go to this doctor , who very, very stupidly prescribes me a strong steroid cream to put on my penis. she told me it would heal the infection faster. i thought ok great. so i use it for only a week, half the time i was told to use it, because eventually i looked up this cream and found out that you should never put that shit down there. i was shocked that this happened to me. i'm a statistic now. the steroid cream not only ruined my skin there, but it fucked with all of the vessels. the cream strongly constricted them, and as a result they are a lot weaker and i have damaged veins as well so i can't get proper erections any more. they are even painful now. i only applied the cream to my head, but this cream was so strong it reached all over my genitals parts of my pelvis. to paint an ugly picture, i now have a red burnt looking dick and red balls/genital area, with sensitive enlarged blood vessels all around. basically there's no cure for this. i've looked and tried every possible thing, but these past couple months i've just given up. to make things worse for me, i can't even enjoy weed anymore because i guess since my vessels are damaged it aggravates them, since thc opens vessels. i'm literally in tons of pain if i try to smoke. i use to be a big pothead, that's how people knew me. that was my thing, my escape, my means of bonding with friends, my way of treating my anxiety.i'm just not happy anymore. my happiness and outlets (sex, weed, even masturbation) were robbed from me because of a dumb bitch ""doctor"".  i'm pretty depressed ever since this happened, and my problem down there seems to be getting worse instead of healing. i'm just fuckin done with this nightmare. i'm tired living like this. i've been wanting to end it all since this happened, but now i think i'm coming pretty close to actually doing it. so yeah here's my rant, hope this made some of you realize that you're not as fucked up as you think","1"
"So first off english is not my first language so I'm sorry already I am a 14 year old boy who is tired of life and everything that comes with it . I had 2 girlfriends one was nice but had really bad social anxiety so I ( like fucking asshole ) left her cause I did not want too deal with it . The other one was a really hard pill too swallow I loved her for a good year ( I think I loved her, I might be too young to ever feel something this strong ) then she told me she liked me too . And for a brief period of time the pain was gone I had the strength too stop alcohol, sleeping pills(not prescribed) and pot and it felt so good kissing her . But it ended too soon and now I have to look at her everyday and it fucking kills me inside.also I don't know if I'm gay bisexual or just in a weird phase and it's just a other burden too wear . Too add to this I have Fordyce spots( a really shitty thing that causes me too have ""spots"" on my ... Dick ... I mean ffs and they cannot get removed) so that really does not help either . I drug myself a lot so I can sleep well or eat without wanting to puke I know I should stop but I just don't have the motivation I don't want to get up in the morning and don't want to train everyday even though I have to . I have to fence ( fencing) everyday and I'm always getting picked on for doing that sport it's a ""faggot sport"" or not even a sport at all ! Plus my brother is better in every fucking way he is healthy , way better looking , has a very nice girlfriend, near perfect grades and my parents like him more and I can't blame them but he always pics on me for being a failure to the family and that I can't get my shit together . I do have other problems but not as big so I will just say them all as fast as possible too show myself that I'm not just overreacting (but am I ? I truly don't know and it drives me crazy) my mother is depressed/suicidal,im shit at school,never loved my body/face,I am a mean overall person and I am a coward for writing this down instead of actually asking for help,my best friend took 20 pills in front of me too kill herself and failed she now is better and I talked too her about my thoughts and she just took off and does not want to talk to me anymore,my all time best friend dad killed him self so he moved to a other City .So too conclude i don't know if it is just a phase or I am truly suicidal it was always a little tough in the back of my head but everyday it grows and gets stronger and I feel like it's only a matter of time before I kill myself . So I am asking you my depressed online friends am I depressed? Or just a drama queen what should I do to get the motivation to help myself and is it just a phase ?","1"
"I haven't felt like this since I was dating my last boyfriend who was heavily abusing me mentally and physically. I'm in an argument with my current boyfriend, who up and left, said he was leaving his phone in his room, and is going out for a drive to clear his head. I'm suffering from severe anxiety and stress over this and other things in my life, and am wondering, once again, if it's better to just not be alive. I don't feel alive anyway, what's the difference? I've never really felt this level of sadness and emptiness in almost 3 years. Does anyone have advice? I feel like I'm having a genuine panic attack.

"A year ago I had everything going for me. I was going to a great school, had good grades, on track to get into a good law school. Then I got sick. My grades tanked, I failed two classes that are only offered every so often, but are necessary for my major. I'd never even gotten a C before in college, so I didn't think it would be the end of the world. The problem is that it was my final semester so I'm out of financial aid, over the unit limit at my school and 2 classes shy from graduating. They cancelled one of the classes I needed in the Fall, so I'm waiting to find out if it will be offered in the summer. Looking like I may have to wait until next fall (after already waiting since failing the classes last Fall, so will be two years total). Meanwhile I'm working a shitty job in sales that I despise because it was the only place that would hire me for a decent salary without a degree. My loans have gone into repayment and I can't afford to quit my job. My advisors have been incredibly unhelpful, one suggesting that I just attend the class at a college that is three hours away, but I'm stuck in a year lease that I can't afford to break. On the commute to work every day I stand on the train platform and think about just ending it. All my friends have great jobs, are loving post grad life. I'm stuck in some sort of awful unending limbo of debt and depression and I don't think I can do it anymore. ","1"

"It's simple. There's nothing wrong with my life as of now, but there is nothing good enough either. I could get up, go to school and do a whole buch of the things that normal people do, but laying in bed and not doing anything is far more comfortable and takes far less energy. So, I consider maybe taking a lethal dose of isopropanol as well as something to make me fall asleep, so I wont have to get up, eat, use the washroom or do anything that requires effort or getting up ever again.I've been thinking about seeing a counsellor or something, but I feel like this is far too mild of an issue for both them and myself, I wouldn't want to take time away from someone who may need it more than me. On top of this, my lack of motivation could be from not having the best life ever, and maybe in order to care more for myself, I just need to wait for myself to heal, and then I could be normal. What should I do?","1"
"I really, really, really don't want to live. Life is awful. It really is. I don't want to do all the things necessary to make everyone around me happy and okay with me and accepting of me - work 40 hours a week, be financially independent, eat healthy and exercise, answer all my emails, practice good social skills, etc. It is unbearably painful and burdensome and I don't want to do it. And I certainly don't want to live with the failure, disappointment, and shame of not doing some/all of those things.But I also don't want to die. I'm less scared of the actual act of dying than I am of not existing. I don't know why that is so scary. I know logically that it was okay not existing for all the time before I was born, so it will be okay not existing when I die...but for some reason I am still so scared. I keep clinging on to hope that something will somehow turn around and life won't suck so much. But I know logically it isn't true.What should I do?","1"
"  I can't take living anymore. I'm a 16 year old guy in 11th grade without a single real friend, a girlfriend, or a reason to live for myself. People tell me that it's okay to be alone or lonely but it's not. I feel like if I had someone just to cuddle with and talk to I would be so much happier. People tell me that I'm ""smart"" yet I keep doing stupid things like staying in bed rather than going to school and not doing projects and other work. People tell me that I'm ""handsome"" yet I've only had one girlfriend who I met in a mental hospital after losing my last (best) friend from having a mental breakdown and saying I was in love with his girlfriend. I was only with her for two months after she left the hospital (she was in there longer for self-harming) and I never even saw or touched her outside of the damn hospital. Everyone else is getting jobs, being with friends, and easily going to school yet I can barely get out of bed. I put so much pressure on myself to do well in school yet my actions are completely inconsistent along with the fact that this year will pretty much determine the rest of my life. Every night if my dreams aren't nightmares they're of me with a girlfriend, someone who actually loves me for who I am and wants hug and cuddle with me. I feel repulsive and stupid. The only reason I haven't killed myself already is because my parents already lost their daughter (my sister) to a heroin overdose and they say that if I died, they would kill themselves because they live for me. They both have had rough lives and I know that it's true. My dad is obviously slowly developing Alzheimer's and his emotional abuse of my mom has gotten worse. My mom is too precious to deserve what he does to her, which is constantly barraging her with insults to further keep her down and pull himself up from his own insecurities. I try to be nice to everyone, I try to talk to girls, I try to smile and pretend to be happy, but nothing ever works. Just typing this is a struggle and my thoughts are all over the place, I really don't want to live, I just want to press a button and poof out of existence. Without affecting anyone. Like as if I never lived at all.","1"
"I don't want to die. I just don't have the will to live. I am in pain. Physical, mental, existential. I am barely alive anymore. I lose more of myself each day.But I know life is worth living even now. I guess while I am not sharing much I just wanted to say something. I am not well. The pressure to live is immense. The world and even those I care about make me feel so guilty for feeling how I do. I want to live like I did before everything happened. I want to triumph over this and find a way to be.But I can't. My health is not going to improve only decline. My memories will continue to fade. My heart continues to torture me. And I find myself a coward unable to face up to it when it happens this early in my life.And even though in moments of weakness my mind tries to convince me to end it all I refuse to accept that. I don't want to die. But I do nothing to save myself anymore.I seek no treatments. I don't bathe or take care of myself. I can barely focus on the things around me.But for the barest moments between the pain I still find moments that remind me how much I love the world and people and things in it. No matter how many times they disappoint me I look for the good and try to help them with their faults.But they handle their problems. I don't seem to be able to do that anymore. Perhaps I never did. I always tried to be strong and self-reliant and there when others need me. So I wouldn't be a burden.Now I am none of those things. I am a crippled, broken vanishing thing. Even saying that makes me hate the pity party I sound like I am evoking. But I don't want to be completely alone. Though I worry others who visit or care for me do so out of pity or something else. I also don't like the pain I see in them when I keep changing into someone else before them.Perhaps I am being selfish. But I am scared. I keep having to chase away thoughts of wanting not to wake up the next morning. And I can't accept forcing that conclusion.But I am not preventing it. I am not eating right. I am not exercising. I am not even bathing properly or doing other hygiene rituals.I know it is just a slower form of suicide. I am wrong to not try. I am wrong to be a coward. I even know it is wrong for me to believe that I can protect others and I am selfish.But I am not wrong on one thing. Life is worth living. Even now.I may not seem to be able to see it clearly anymore but I refuse to believe that pain invalidates life.I love every moment I live. I am grateful even now for my life.I am scared though. I don't want to die. But I can't seem to will myself to live anymore.I can't find a good reason to continue. But there is no reason to quit other than the pain in all its forms.I guess the only purpose I currently have is to find purpose with the time I have left.I guess I just wanted to clear my head. Thanks for listening...","1"
"Hi all,So I've had one hell of a year. My gf of 5 years abused me physically and emotionally and then cheated on me and left me out on the streets. I've attempted to kill myself multiple times but always backed out because I wanted to spite her by making something of myself.Then I met a group of people at my work and we all became quick friends. We all party together and hang out and have alot of fun. They helped me get over my relationship and made me feel life was  worth living. I love them all so much but I can't shake this feeling that they don't have that same feeling towards me. They all have a bond that I feel I'll never be able to have with any of them. And it sucks, it makes me feel so alone. I'm really am trying to accept that is how it is and the bonds we have with each other are going to be different but I want to feel that same love.And it makes me feel even worse because I feel like such a needy piece of shit. They've only known me for less than 6 months whereas they've known each other for years. But I feel so alone. I feel if I up and disappeared they'd forget about me easily. I've never had a set group of friends. I've always been forgot about and thrown to the way side. I do try to maintain my friendships but life gets in the way. I don't want to lose them but with how my life goes I can not fight the inevitable.I really want to end this cycle. I want to stop feeling so alone and forgotten. I hate it. I just want this pain to end. I plan on ending it soon. No last words. No suicide note. Nothing. I'll just disappear. And they'll all forget about me. Like everyone always does. No one cares about me. My family, the one girl I loved, and even my friends. I've tried reaching out. But it's either I drive people away or they tell me to get professional help. No one wants to hear how I feel, but I am the shoulder to cry on for people, I am the one who listens, I'm there for people when they need it. But no one wants to be there for me. Everyone forgets and moves on. But they're so content to let me drown. So fucking tired of it. I'll just let it swallow me  and just end it all so it'll stop hurting.","1"

"Hey I'm having issues finding any real hope for staying alive. I work in agriculture and over the last year I have been having suicidal thoughts for 2 reasons.1) I hate the grad school I'm at.2) I can't find hope for the future of humanity because of climate change.I have dealt with with the first one by expediting my research so I can get my masters degree which is good so I can start working on a degree in ag. education which is what I want to work in. The second is a bigger issue. I can't avoid the issue of climate change because it affects everything in the field I work. It seems like that if we continue at the rate of which we send out CO2 then humanity as we know it will no longer exist. This never leaves my mind and no matter how much help I get from group and from personal therapy. I would like to be happy again yet still know the issues we face in the environment.  I see my fellow colleges with kids and hopes for careers and they know just as much about environmental issues if not more then I do. I just want to be happy but its just hard to get this out of my mind or to deal with it in a healthy way. I have no real vices as I see getting drunk, smoking, doing drugs, ect as a way of not dealing with the issue. Also to be honest many things are going very well in my life, I'm going to be applying to a new school for a degree in what I want to do, I'm healthy, I'm in good shape, I think I'm a good looking guy, ect but I just can't deal with the thought of a doomed future.

"ive been suicidal for weeks. depressed for as long as i can remember. im physically unable to feel hapiness. i can't describe the feeling. the closest i get to it is when im drunk. i have a great life. everything should be fine, im in college and academically succeeding, i have loads of friends who care, my family is together and very nice. but i can't feel any of the benefits of these things. i talked to the doctors weeks ago about it, and ive kept getting worse but they dont listen. every week i get told the help will come next week and it never comes. two weeks ago i was told i would have to be referred before i could get medication, so i got referred and spoke to the mental health service last week. they told me that i need an appointment with them plus a doctor which would be this week. this week comes and i have an appointment but not with a doctor, judt with them again. they have said the appointment eith the doctor will be next week, which is only for a slight chance at some meds. counselling is not helping. therapy is not helping. i have not been given medication and i almost certainly will not be even if i survive the ten excruciating days until that appointment. i don't want to go on like this anymore. i don't want to be alive. it hurts so much the more i think and the longer i have to wait. i don't care about the impact my suicide will have on people. i don't care that i have my whole life ahead of me. people keep telling me those things but i don't care. yes im being selfish, and no that doesn't bother me. im not going to be fixed. so im not going to live. tomorrow im going to go to the train tracks for my way out. hopefully it can finally be over.","1"
"I'm done with life. I'm failing school (dropped a class and getting a D in an important class). Every semester I tell my family I'll do better, but that's been going on for about 2 years now, and my motivation to succeed is long gone. I'm tired of being a burden on my dad who's been fortunate enough to pay for me and my brother's tuition. I can't waste his money anymore. My brother isn't a star student either. At least maybe my dad could use my tuition money for my brother in case he needs an extra semester or two.I know my dad would hate me talking about him right now. For a long time now, my excuse for doing bad has always been my dad getting upset. But as I've gotten older, I realize it's not his fault. It's mine. I know that I'm smart. I'm just a lazy fuck. It also never helped that my mom pretty much encouraged my brother and I to place the blame on our dad. Yeah, he gets pissed, and him lecturing us on how we're lazy doesn't feel good, but it's the damn truth, and if I were him I'd get pissed at me too. He's gone from living in a car to a fantastic career. Yet, here's my family, putting blame on him.It also doesn't help that he lost his job about a year ago, and he hasn't found another one. Sometimes I think that I should stay alive for him, but the thing is that he says that me and my brother doing well in school keeps him motivated to keep looking. I'm doing bad right now in school. Yeah, suicide might make it worse, but at least we'll have extra money (hopefully he will save it for my brother in case he needs more time to graduate).Graduation isn't for me anymore. School isn't either. Me committing suicide might make my family's situation worse, but it will make my situation better.If my parents ever read this: I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. It's all my fault.

"I'm not really sure why I'm posting this, maybe just to get it written out. I don't really want help and I'm sorry if it's a bit long.I am a firm believer that there are aspects of ourselves that we can know with certainty and that others can't or shouldn't question. For instance, if someone decided that they know, deep down with unwavering certainty that they are a Christian or a Jew or vegetarian we accept that. If someone comes out as gay we accept that they know this about themselves to be the absolute truth. I give these examples to illustrate a point. I know, with every fiber of my being that I shouldn't be alive, I'm not supposed to be here and I want to die very badly. I've had this conscious thought since I was 10 years old and every day since then has been torture. I have tried in the past to get therapy thinking that something is wrong with me and I could be fixed. Every single time has been an unmitigated disaster. Fear of being incarcerated in a mental health facility (which has happened the 1 and only time I ever expressed my suicidal thoughts) has kept me from opening up and as a result any counseling I've gotten over the years has been frustratingly pointless as mental health professionals refuse to even entertain the idea that I know I shouldn't be alive.I'm not a religious person but I still pray every day because if there is a non zero chance that god exists I can't afford to miss that opportunity. I pray every time I go to sleep that I never wake up and each time I do I get more and more frustrated. I pray for the strength to take matters into my own hands and every time I lose my nerve I hate myself a little bit more. But I still pray and force myself to really believe that each sleep will be my last.Maybe the frustration is just latent will to live draining away and one day, if god doesn't do it for me, I'll finally be able to do what should have been done decades ago. Honestly, the hope of death is the only thing keeping me from madness.","1"

She told me she doesn't want someone who is suicidal to spend the night anymore, because she is scared they might kill themselves in our home. I've already explained to her that the friend is getting help and they use that journal as a type of therapy. The chances of the friend killing themselves in our home is also almost non-existent, and to me, is something that shouldnt be worried about.

I just tried to kill myself in a mental breakdown I had having an argument with my mother. I am always so close to do it, I don't know what's holding me back. I need to talk to someone so badly...  I'm 20. I live in a constant battle with myself it's so exhausting, it's like if a part of me is trying to give advice to the depressed othet half of me. I try so hard to be positive, to think that it's just a phase, that I will feel better soon. I suck at everything, and I'm not trying to sound dramatic. I have some friends that are just to go party because I know that none of them could ever understand the hell I live in. My family..oh how I wish I had grown up in a loving and understanding family.. sometimes I say okay I'm going to talk to my mom about this, but she doesn't takr my mental health seriously at all, she just called me crazy. I literally have no one. My best friend and I don't talk anymore, he was the only one that could understand and I don't have him anymore because I pushed him away.. I push everyone away. Now I know how is it like when you hate yourself. I see everyone being ""normal"" , enjoying their friends and families, having jobs, having plans and goals and how I wish I could be in their position.. I don't know what am I here for anymore, I feel like I'm never going to get anywhere in life, I'm so done with myself, with my own mind that is my biggest enemy. Depression fucking sucks.","1"
"Nothing in life matters to me anymore. The only people I could ever open up to either are done with me (for good reason because I just ruin everything) or they're too busy making it so if I want to talk I'm basically just butting into their lives and disrupting everything. In addition to not having anyone to truly confide it, I hate my job, I have zero prospects, and everything I once found fun is nothing now. No job appeals to me, no hobby works (I've tried to start many). I'm just empty. I don't see a fulfilling life for me. Hell I don't even see a decent one. And the best way to make sure those other people, my family and friends, don't have to deal with my constant negative attitude is to leave.","1"

I have my ups and downs just like everyone else. Next week I'll probably be on a high and enjoying life again before crashing back down and haunted by these thoughts again. I'll hold out another 24 hours. It would probably break my parent's hearts though. I can't do that to them. There's no way I could possibly write out my emotions and feelings in a suicide letter.

"28 November 2017, the date of my suicide, is almost here. I have chosen my method, worked out my logistics and tied up loose ends.Life just wasn't for me. I tried education and college but dropped out in my final year. After I was no longer a student, I guess I lost my sense of identity. In college I mattered. I was somebody and I had a purpose: to finish exams and get a degree. Now as a dropout, my options are limited and there is no path available to me that truth excites me. I can't work a dead-end job going nowhere and not making a difference. I thought about the military as that would give me a purpose and I would feel like I was part of something more but now I don't feel the same. Suicide seems like the next logical option. I know my friends and family will be shocked and unable to see why I choose to do this. I wish I could explain to them in person exactly why and answer their questions but unfortunately that's not possible. I hope any of you who read this and feel similar to me find your purpose and live a long and happy life but for me that's not the case. Goodbye. ","1"
"No need for description really. I've suffered from depression since i was a child. At 17-19 i went thru a bad relationship with a girl who was out of my league an she knew it. She constantly shit on me an treated me like crap.Fast forward 12 years I'm married but separated as if 1 month ago. All of it is due to me not being emotionally there an not showing appreciation to my wife. I end up have anxiety/panic attacks start 4 years ago. All of this piles into me having zero self worth or self esteem. This last month has pushed me into a very dark hole i have been mildly suicidal before in my early 20s. But this time is worse I've actually made a plan purchased needed items an have the area set up but lacking the courage.I can not live without my wife but at the same time i hate holding her back. I've voiced my thoughts of wanting to die an she only says things like ""you better not harm yourself at all."" Or ""I'll never forgive you!"" I know i hurt her but when I'm in my depression stage I'm like a zombie in the world i don't notice stuff or signs. I've told her i take all the blame but i want her to talk to me an to try to work this out but she has zero interest in fixing it. II've lasted this last month on shear willpower hoping i could fix it. Few weeks back she tells me shes 100% done. An i honestly blocked it out for a few days then had a massive breakdown. Since then I've just wanted to die everyday to the point that I've wrote my letter an gathered needed materials.I know we are told not to be descriptive but i have to say my plan. My plan is to mix a few sleeping aides in excessive amount wait till i start to get tired then get in place[a tree in my backyard] an send out my letter on social media. Then just wait till i pass out an hang myself. I guess im writing this just to really say it instead of just thinking about it. So there it is.

"I'm kind of in a serious situation. It really sucks. Your input might literally save my life, because I've considered ending it over this honestly it's bad. Hear me out. Okay so.I've always been kind of an socially anxious tense nervous ""brain damaged"" kid. My mom never breastfed me, dad was never home working all the time, earliest experiences with others outside immediate family like other children bullied me, girls / first crushes and love like laughed at me and were super mean like giving back my gifts on valentines day or and laughing and screaming at me to get away and the whole class uproaring in laughter, pretending to like me or ask me out in front of their friends, adult teachers being incredibly mean to me making me cry often and embarrassing me, wow, so, I guess I got a little less tense and awkward and anxious around people as I grew up, but it was still kinda always there.When I was a in a fish bowl of high school / college, I had friends. Everyone had commonalities - we were all either learning cool subjects and Majoring in similar things, going out to get wasted and do ridiculous hilarious fun things and chase girls, or in high school it was all about liking the same bands, having inside jokes about the same movies laughing about them together and quoting them, liking similar bands, video games, relationships, movies, similarities like that - like meeting people in your same classes from almost being forced to see them again and again and again, finding common interests, going out outside of school to just hang out and do whatever.. Then you'd work some minimum wage job, meet a few people that way, interact and joke with them or interact with them or whatever, same thing being ""forced"" to see them over and over and over again, so you naturally sort of become close and friends, often at places like the gym or at school, right? So then comes my next step in life after college: Get a career, right?Well, because the social anxiety thing was always with me causing distress, I began to spend a lot of time in my 3rd / 4th year of college in my room. I'm a MASSIVE introvert. I'd still socialize and stuff but since it was ALWAYS painful and I was forced around others through school or work, I decided to try to end the pain by spending more time alone to get relief and pursue personal goals like music, reading, art, and making money online. My roommates would joke and say I wouldn't ""come out of my cave"" and stuff. I decided instead of doing some stressful job around the chaos of other people all day, which exhausts me, I'd build an internet company. Turns out it was a massive success. I made $100k my first year. Right out of college.I bought my own apartment, then a house, all on my own, new areas. I was really scared to go out and be seen vulnerable in distress and stuff I rarely did. Just like to the market, and maybe the beach. I'm not a virgin. I used to get drunk and had a lot of random sex. I can get the engine going if I needed to. Being alone all the time though and having a sex drive, I began to view pornography and masturbating. It became an addiction. I mean who doesn't want to view beautiful HD women doing stimulating things in the privacy and comfort of your own house? I kept putting going out and meeting people in the future ""when I.... [insert excuse]"" because it was so uncomfortable and stressful and not enjoyable for me.Okay so fast forward. The damage has been done. Looking back I have been 4-5 years next to totally alone, I've seen no one but my parents occasionally, the internet business kinda tanked and I've been living back at my parents house I'm almost 30 years old.I now suffer from intense depression. I guess as we age we begin to decline. My brain was always fragile. Now even more so. Mental health challenge. I became a workaholic trying to rescue the internet business (Think me in a room spending time on a computer allllllll day...... totally alone) anyways now I am suuuupppeeerrr exhausted and depressed most of the day. I am like weak and terrified to leave my front door. My looks, youth, and hairline are starting to go.I'm now at the point where I see groups of more adult ""normal"" people my age like going out to amazing places, going on Friday night dates, I just can't take the isolation anymore. And I don't know how to get out of it. The obstacle is that:1) I'm very sick, depressed and tired, most of the day. I'm weaker than most other people my age it feels like :(. I don't have as much stamina. I can't party like I did in college. I have to go to bed early. Who cares? I feel like an old man. So if I begin making friends / dating, how would I keep up with them, and wouldn't any woman my age just hop over to the next normal, socially functioning guy who with a job and friends and who can take her on all these amazing dates and have sex way longer pleasing her more than me and stuff? So I thought baby steps step one for me would be just making friendships and building social skills, networking, just starting going out of the house again, right?2) I have NO IDEA where to go to meet people in the adult world, to make friends, especially being challenged like this so I can practice and build social skills. Sitting in a room alone all day typing on a screen and ""making love"" to pixels has made me somewhat weird, or at least conditioned to be different from most everyone else, I'm sure. So, back to the point, where does any adult go, who missed a career, to meet people and make friends and build his social skills? Like I said I am pretty sick with depression, I can hardly have the physical energy or stamina to do much so I don't think working a job all day around people is feasible, plus, aren't people miserable at their jobs anyways? My parents said I can die in this house and inherit it. I have a car. But where do I go? I feel so weird at this point, isolated, cut off, disconnected, I don't fit in anywhere. I've literally thought about suicide. I don't know why anyone would want to be my friend, especially as I get uglier, older, and weaker, more tired, less fun right? I mean, in the adult world, other than immediate family and work, do people even have friends? I literally don't know anymore what to do, or how to fix myself and fit in again and find love and community. I think I am just going to go walk around theme parks or something. Maybe start going to concerts and hope for the best? But these are events, how would that work for a consistent social network or circle and me being able to practice in a safe learning environment, where I'm not bullied and laughed at by other functioning incredible people? I feel like this Earth has left me nowhere to go. I walk up to people limping and challenged super vulnerable and shy, it's super sad and probably I'm not an immediate pick to be a top choice friend or lover. If you read this far, your input could literally be saving my life, I mean if I approached you at a bar or something, would YOU want to invite me over to hang out or be my long-term lover? I'm so depressed / exhausted nervous and tense around others these days guys, seeing everyone out laughing and normal on a Saturday night is killing me guys, thank you so much for your feedback.PEACE.","1"

"This is kind of long so I will try and hit the key points and not jump all over the place.  A bit of backstory.  My daughter is 14, 15 in January.  She has a pretty good life I think, we are part of the rapidly dying middle class so although she attends private school in LA and sees kids with way way more money and things than she has I don't think it matters much to her and she really wants for nothing.  She is not abused, her mother and I are still married and still ove each other and we give her tons of love, support, attention etc.  She has ADHD and severe dyslexia and has been medicated for these LDs since 3rd grade.  She is currently on strattera and adderall but she still struggles to keep up with the homework load at school and her grades suffer.  She also started a high school at a new school this year and has had some difficulty finding where she fits in socially.  This is very important to her as I'm sure it is for most teenage girls and it should be said that she only attended her previous school for 7th and 8th grade while most of the other students had been there since 2nd and she never really found her placer there either.  While trying to fit in at that school she made two major mistakes, causing rifts within the group of girls she was friends with that she was never able to recover from, these have really stuck with her (if you think it's relevant I will describe those events but in the interest of saving space I'm leaving it out).  Most of the time she is a happy kid but for the past maybe 3 or 4 months all she wants to do is shut herself in her room in the dark and look at her phone or computer.  Most of the time she is looking at pictures of mag con boys, I think I got that right, or watching shows, she likes Teen Wolf and Skins etc.  My wife and I started to think something was up because she never wanted to come out of there to do something with us or go somewhere or make plans with friends but we figured hey she's a teenage girl and being moody, whatever.About a month ago one of her friends from her old school called my wife and said that he got a text from my daughter saying she wants to kill herself.  It hit us pretty hard as can be expected but mostly because we had no idea she was THAT unhappy.  My wife talked with her and she said she feels so all alone in the world and she has nobody to confide in or seek comfort in aside from us.  We tried to tell her that these things take time to happen and she will forge new friendships that will last forever, not like her grade school friendships that most of which have fizzled out.  We took her to the emergency room as there was not a therapist who could see her immediately and the therapist there said that she is not a constant suicide threat, that she has these major depression events and that is when she feels suicidal.  We got her into regular therapy just before Thanksgiving and I'm hoping it will help.Here is where I need your advice.  Ever since then my wife and I don't know how to handle her.  In the past when she has done poorly in school she gets in trouble and there is usually some big blow up and things go back to normal.  Now she is continuing to fall behind on homework and get bad grades and when my wife tries to talk to her they have a huge fight and she goes to her room and we sit there paranoid that she will try and kill herself.  It has crippled us as parents.  I know that we have to continue being her parents but we are not sure how.  There are so many things I want to say to her that I know are the wrong thing to say.  I feel like reading her some stories from the internet of seriously abused kids to show her that her life is pretty sweet, or threatening her that if she takes her life I would have no reason to live and will then take my own but I know those are wrong and I'm not going to say them.  The question is what is the right thing to say?  How do I get through and help her realize that life is worth living and these feelings will pass, hopefully?  What do I do about the schoolwork, I told my wife that we just have to set the suicide aside and be parents and punish her when she gets bad grades but my wife is just so afraid they will have a fight that pushes her over the edge.  Thank you for taking the time to read all this, I'll answer any other questions you have if it will help.","1"

I had abusive parents both mentally and physically, I was an accident, always had financial problems because my mum had me at 16, mum is an alcoholic, dad has always been unemployed, I've always felt useless, never heard I love you, even with the best grades I was never told I made anyone proud, just to ""get a job"". I'm tired of consistently looking at the stars and just pondering why I'm not up there with them, why I look at the fields and why I can't just run through them. Why am I trapped inside such a chronostatic bubble that keeps repeating? I don't want to live anymore.I'm sorry for my formatting and useless sense of direction. It's just a cry for attention and help. I've never used this site before.","1"
"Why does dying have to be so difficult? I wish it was easier, like pressing a button. It was not my choice to be born with this shit life and me. Even something as simple as drinking poison results in an extremely painful death. Guns are quicker, but it's not easy to get your hand on one and use them and even then you might live handicapped for the rest of your life. Life's literally just a fuckin' lottery, and the circumstances and the things you were born with (which are completely random btw) will define the rest of your life. Some are lucky, and then there are the unlucky depressed, lonely shites like me with perpetual existential crisis just waiting for the sweet release of death.","1"
"DO NOT FUCKING UPVOTE THIS PILE OF SHIT.I just want to die. And before all of those retards show up posting ""OMGERD if you really wanted to die, you'd just do it already"" let me express the following.I want a relatively painless end. My life has been very, very painful and I don't believe I deserve to be punished by having a painful death.The only methods I can think of that are painless and safe for anyone else that may walk into the place are firearm and shooting up morphine or a synthetic opiate.I don't WANT to die, but I really don't see any other option. The drugs they give me make me feel horrible to the point where I have tried to kill myself by OD several times. I usually end up bashing my head against the wall of a cell until they put me under.I've posted my history on here before. It's rough. But today, beyond all of that damage I'm slogging through, I'm floundering with my anger over my ex's new husband.Given my outbursts before and anger issues, I really don't want to be in the same room as this guy if he says something. I will go bananas on him. I mean, full retard meets American History X. The compulsion has been overwhelming in the past. I have spent these past several years taking the medication and working very hard on my impulse control issues.That being said, I was fine until the dreams started.It seemed like it was all night. This powerful compulsion to beat the living shit out of him. Over and over and over. I would wake up covered in sweat and angry as hell.I started downing my medication by the fistful just to keep myself from going insane and smashing shit around the house.I am proud to say I haven't broken a thing. I've just deleted my facebook, deleted most of my friends off of Steam and braced myself for her (the ex's) anger as she really wants me to spend time with the girls. And I do too.I've been pretty much unconscious since Friday and the urge to go jump off a bridge, in front of a train or to make H2S has been very strong.People on here keep on saying ""it's easy to kill yourself, just do it"" well no shit retard, but it's much harder to go peacefully and NOT hurt/traumatize people in the process.And I really don't feel like collecting 1 lb of seeds to make a poison either. Does anyone understand what I'm going through? Too broken to be out there, too scared to be in a cage at a psych ward?Because I won't go. Never again. And I will make them kill me before I go back there to all of the bullshit medications, the rolling eyes of the staff and general disinterest in people like me.So instead I've begun a scorched earth policy against my life and everyone in it.I've been torturing myself for years now trying to be ok, but the truth is, I've been too depressed to take care of myself, let alone anyone else and THAT thought right there. That knowledge that I'm too fucked up to be around my girls.... my chest feels like an finger of ice is being pushed into my heart.There's no hope. I'm just too much of a chicken to dig around for a main artery. That and, again, I don't think I deserve such a violent death.Oh and FYI, trying to overdose on street drugs sucks because it isn't pure and I end up just tripping balls and then feeling the withdrawals which is horrendous. Nothing like feeling like a useless piece of shit PLUS feeling like your blood is on fire.","1"
"i don't feel like there is any point to me carrying on living anymore.i don't know... i just hat my life. all my school work is too much, but i am dealing with that.the main issue is my parents.i finally moved out and am living in a hostel. i managed to get away from their toxicity - or so i thought. but all the things my mum has said and done is still affecting me greatly.i have panic attacks whenever i hear anyone shout or speak in a certain tone of voice (accusatory, maybe? i can't describe it :/)i had to stay at my parents house over the weekend due to a leak cutting off all electricity to my floor of the hostel, meaning no cooking or shower facilities.i was only meant to e at my parents friday night. they'd already taken me back to the hostel on saturday but then the leak happened...everything was alright between us mostly. but then sunday happened and my mum just wouldn't stop shouting at me and my dad and using that horrible tone of voice.so, while i was trying to get to sleep last night, i was in a constant state of panic...and my dad is trying to force me to see a movie with my mum on friday night... i dont want to and wont have the energy for it anyway and will be very tired...but i will have to go or hear about how i am so uncaring and selfish... i can't deal with this bullshit.i don't see a point in living coz its just going in this endless cycle of bad and worse. after school today i might as well just cut and keep cutting until i either feel something or hit and artery and bleed out... or i could go into town instead of going home and jump into the thames? Or just jump in front of a train. i just don't want to exist anymore. everything is too much. i don't want to live just to be told how worthless i am by my mum whenever i see her...i could end it right here in school if i wanted. i have my blades. or i could make it simple and just jump off the balcony...i want this to just end already...","1"

I just keep catching myself wishing it would all just end. Life is hard, man, and I don't think I want to go through it anymore, but I just can't find the guts to end it... I feel like such a fucking coward, both for thinking of this easy way out, and for not being able to do it.Add in my constant paranoia about those closest to me, thinking about how they secretly hate me, and I can feel my mind slowly going insane from it all.... I can't even cry it out, only bottle it all up and keep it in, it gives me a constant sinking feeling deep inside. I just want it to end, I just want peace and a reason to live ","1"

"I'm a former philosophy and english major. Whatever academic aspirations I had are long gone. My body is deteriorating. My hair slipping away, but body crashing from drugs, alcohol, and cigarettes. I'm in a pit I can't seem to escape. Tried a few times to die but all the attempts were half-assed. Been looking for answers for a long time. Thought maybe I'd find them somewhere in doomed love affairs, Ingmar Bergman, or Sartre, but all I'm left with is this bitter hopelessness, this infinite veil of sorrow that colors the all fabrics of my banal, broken life. I was born in poverty, and for most of my life I wore that adversity as a point of pride, but the older I get, the worse it feels. Lost the love of my life years ago after two miscarriages. Never fully got over it. I don't see much hope on this horizon. And yet I'm painfully aware at how precious human life is, how infinitesimal the chances were that I was ever born to begin with, and how brutally I've fucked up a life that could have been so much more fulfilling. I used to be able to harness this pain to create cool shit, to try to bring some beauty to this fleeting existence, but I feel so sick now that I can't even write anymore. I can't make music. I can't create beautiful things. And because I lack the fortitude as of yet to pull the trigger, all I can do is make as many attempts possible to kill myself or cross my fingers that I OD on something. I miss having dreams. I miss being able to cry. This emptiness, this depersonalization has gotten so bad that outside of a dull ache in the pit of my stomach I can't feel fucking anything. Wish I could fucking sleep forever. ","1"

But then I think about how guilty I would feel leaving everyone in my aftermath... But I honestly can NOT live like this anymore. I WANT TO DIE! I keep researching overdosage information and I may actually do it soon. I fantasize about it more often now. If it fucks me up and I survive somehow, maybe I deserve that too. I don't know anymore.

"Hey guys (and gals)! Welcome to the third addition of my trilogy of my aimless rambling!I just upgraded my plan to give me another gigabyte of data (only $10 more!) so that I can keep posting. Honestly it's the only thing that's keeping me from going down that dark spiral.I'm sure that it's not only me but I feel like being alone with your own thoughts is just the worst. During the day I'm able to suppress my dark thoughts due to stimulus but when it's time for bed that layer of protection from day to day stimulus is gone. My thoughts are predator to the prey that is myself. Vulnerable and alone they begin to seep into my brain, saturating my cortex with the scariest and loneliest truths like a paper towel soaking up bacon fat.

"Hello. Today, im looking to write one out. It's November 27, 2017, 8:19 pm, Monday. To be honest, I waited for 8:19 to end so that I could record a clean 8:20. Other than that, I tried killing myself tonight that fails every now and then, guessing hope still remains within me. I've been thinking about it a lot these days, how I'm better off dead, how I'd write my suicide note, how I'd say ""nothing"" defines my life and it's entirety. Yeah, I'm depressed, I hide it with a mask of emotions that works well with my friends and family. I guess it works so because i was wearing the mask that I actually am before I got depressed. I am depressed about everything but sometimes, i think I'm not. I guess I would know if i got clinically diagnosed as depressed by a doctor, or not. I think That's what got me depressed, Uncertainty. And got layered by vital things such as negativity, isolation, failures and whatnots. I guess what I'm certain about is that bad things leads to bad things, eventually. However, I still started that sentence with an ""I guess"".I consider myself as depressed in a literate factor. I sometimes feel dark, think dark, feel nothing, think nothing, feel something, think something. That being said, I wanted whatever this feeling is to end could be by ending my life or getting better at life, either way I'm always willing for this to end as I've tried to fill this holes with hope and try to throw away the overflowing tub of darkness.As I lay here in darkness, writing, trying to delay all instances im trying to execute with my self. Nothing interests me in this moment but to write it out, A constant shift of interest comes in way every time. The feeling of being lost and can't find something for a hint of path. The feeling of drowning and can't hold onto something to rise. The feeling of falling and can't cling to something to grasp on. Comes the feeling of wanting it to end and disregarding the ""and""s and ""what if""s.I lay here in darkness, immensely trying to cry and let it out. But nothing falls.","1"
"I'm not really good at writing butAfter being heartbroken to a girl I crushed on for 3 years and then thinging with her for a month and then being dumped without reason. I mourned for her and eventually got over her however through bad descions like turning to bad influences, 2 long years of thinging with girls that never last more than a few months I realized my mistake when I recently had my  first gf and also my first breakup . I didn't treat girls like how they were supose to be treated I took them for granted. I would love the girl at first but after it was all just  lust like  the first base it would just be me filling the void in my heart . I didn't notice my lust that I hurt so many girls through this and I hurt myself over and over agian. I know you probaly think I'm making this up or like how could he be so stupid to make this up but today is the day I realized and I appogize to all the girls I hurt through my own selfish reasons though u all loved me genuinely.I hope the next girl that comes in my life well be treated with the upmost respect that a women deserves Thank you. :'( I hope I get one more chance at loveMan I just feel like suicide is the answer to my problemsLike end it now so no more pain ","1"

"I called the Suicide Hotline twice today because I just wanted to talk - literally just talk because it was a struggle to open my mouth at all today.This is my situation that I know no one will empathize with me for, making me feel even more depressed and suicidal: I'm a 23 year old guy who recently experienced loss of my eyebrow hairs. I got microblading done (natural looking semi-permanent eyebrow tattoo) a couple months ago and the regret has been KILLING me. It's faded and looks terrible and obvious and I spend every waking second wishing I never did it and I'm so self conscious now. I've become reclusive and depressed. Yes, over a fucking eyebrow tattoo. It's the constant thinking about it that's killing me. I feel embarrassed, ashamed, stupid, exhausted, paranoid, anxious ALL THE TIME. The past few days I've just been at home, trying not to think about it, but I can't not. I'm not going to kill myself over this, but it's definitely killing me. And it's hard because I KNOW how dumb this sounds but it's a nightmare ON MY FACE that I have to live with... I can't believe this is my life right now. I've been through actual shit in my life like dealing with my parent's divorce, calling the cops on them, raising my little brother, taking care of my aging grandma, dealing with my friend's suicide attempt, heartbreaks, you name it. But I've NEVER felt like this before because I feel like I did it to myself and there's NO ONE who can understand and will look at me normally now. I've gotten stares, I feel like people are whispering, I can't live like this. I feel like a freak and I don't think I'll ever be the same again...Sigh. Just ranting. Another sleepness night.","1"

I have work at 12 am. I work at home, I never go out. I just don't even go out of my room anymore. This has been happening for almost three years now since I've got my job as a chat moderator/contact support online. My job is fairly easy. But my mental health has been deteriorating.

I cannot go out there and hustle because I have extreme anxiety and depression (professional diagnosed, i only went once or twice but never again) I got hooked on benzos. Almost died at december 2015 for doing lean because benzos withdrawals, man. I lost A FUCKTON of friends because fuck, I don't know why I cant seem to talk to anyone without my brain wanting to die on itself. Everything is exhausting. I sleep 10 hours a day, I go to work, rinse and repeat. My room looks like it's depressed, i look like death in the mirror. Today, takes the cake.I can hear hissing in my left ear. The biggest fear I have is having tinnitus. I thought this was only an episode of an anxiety attack. This started saturday night when my friend was telling me he was going to kill himself on his  birthday (the 29th) and i was trying to talk him out of it, all the while preparing for work. After work, around 8 am, i was having a panic attack because we were fighting, I was mad at him for even thinking to do that - but that's besides the point I hear a hissing in my ear.My biggest fear in life is having tinnitus. This is going to drive me insane. Now, the sound is barely noticeable but this takes the cake. I can feel anxiety take over me. It's bad enough i had a depressive episode (where i can feel my entire body shut down and my chest just kinda turned into his gaping void) but to have this ugly anxiety because of the hissing in my left ear. Is this from anxiety or is it because of what, earwax build up? My left ear has been aching for months, now. What is this? The hissing on my left ear I wouldn't mind if my anxiety just won't stop acting up, My hands are shaking. I feel goosebumps all over my body.Please help. I can listen to music but I don't want to. I'm to depressed to do anything. I can't believe i am writing this, I'm 21, by the way. I just. Don't know. What to do. The hissing stopped, it's an on and off thing. I just want to sleep. man.

"There is a group of people.They are really nice.I met one of them because we are sit next to each other in a class.idk why but i trust him.I told him about me and the shit in my head,my thoughts about suicide...He said that if i take drugs(weed for now) and they make me a part of their `gang`then i will change.He said i shouldn`t kill myself.He didnt really say that much but still.One day i gave him 450Euro(536,8725Dollar) and i told him to buy me enough drugs to die.He can keep the rest.I dont have any expirience with drugs but i think that you cann kill at least 5 people with that much money.He rejected.The next day someone talked to me.He wanted to know why i want to kill myself.He was shocked.Apparently the guy i asked told him.I dont have a problem with that but i feel kind of uncomfortable about this dude.we both have a crush on a girl.AnywaysAny ideas how i can get my drugs?I only have these few people and they wont give me drugs or tell me where they get drugs from.Maybe i wont commit suicideI just want to leave the option open to do so.","1"
"It feels like Im alone in the world but I know Im not. I have a family a girlfriend and a couple friends but none of them could see me today so I just laid in bed.

"Every time I feel like killing myself, I can vividly imagine calling poison control or 911 with tears streaming down my face after deciding to back out of my attempt. I just wish there was a painless, instant ""stop living"" button so there could be no middleman and I could just die instantly.In fact, I know that I'm so incapable of killing myself that I wake up every morning lamenting the fact that some sort of undiagnosed terminal disease hadn't killed me in my sleep. Every day I hope that I end up the victim of involuntary manslaughter in some kind of freak accident, just because I know I would bitch out of suicide. Fuck everything.

"I won't sleep tonight. I'll be awake with my mind screaming, my throat tight, my heart aching and my body feeling cold. And then in the morning, maybe, I'll be alright. Then it won't seem so bad. Life goes on. But holy shit... the way it hurts right now...The worst part is that it comes and goes. For the past five years, as well as studying and recently graduating high school. I have been seeing psychologists. Been on meds. Been in mental wards. And it feels like I'm going backwards. I've tried explaining it to so many doctors that I just can't open up anymore. There's nothing to tell. I'll be fine.So tonight, in my head, things are pretty bad. Really bad. Then when I wake up it'll all be gone and I'll be shrugging it off, because there's nothing I can do, nobody I can go to, to change anything.Here I am, I guess. 5 years with depression and anxiety, or maybe something more or something else, who knows. Went through the mental health system for help and I guess it shat me out, so I'm learning to live with it.Tonight it's bad enough that I'm reading up on suicide again and found this sub, even wrote a post just screaming quietly for help where I know that there's nothing I expect people to say that will help.I'll be fine...","1"

"Late 20's, male, and extremely bored of life. I don't do much of anything besides work and sit around watching YouTube and playing video games. I don't really have friends, definitely no girlfriend. I feel like I have wasted the prime of my life and haven't really ""lived."" I have had suicidal thoughts for as long as I can remember but it was never really serious until now. I'm approaching 30 and haven't done anything with my life. I should be married with kids by now... not even close. It's time for a major change.I have been thinking for a while now about quitting my job and traveling until I get tired of it or run out of money. I have saved up quite a bit so I think I should be able to go for a while. I haven't seen the whole US so I first plan on taking a solo road trip and seeing every state and all of the sites along the way. Then possibly head abroad. The plan is to get a camper shell for my truck and sleep in the bed, take showers at my gym which has locations everywhere, and make food as much as possible to keep it on the cheap. If I choose to do this it will probably be around March when the weather is nice everywhere so there is still plenty of time to plan, or back out...I don't really know what to expect from this adventure but I figure I've got nothing to lose at this point. Maybe I will meet some cool people, maybe I will see some cool stuff, or maybe not. All I know is that my current situation isn't cutting it and I need to do something or I am going to end up jumping off a bridge.Am I crazy for wanting to do this? Anyone have any tips?","1"

"I was born with an Imperforate Anus, which mean i don't have an anus when i was born. My parent sold their house to try to fix me. After 6 years on and off the hospital, i finally got a surgery to fix that but it come with its own problem, i can't really control my bowel. I grow up with that situation where i don't know when i'm going to take a dump. It may sound silly, but shitting your pants at a teenager and have them laughing at you is not a comfortable at the slightest. I tried my best at school but i never really excel, whenever i fail something people would told me that my family spent everything on me and i turn out like this, that i'm a burden to everyone. My closet friend move away when i was 12 and was left alone without any friends for a long time. That was when i started feeling depressed. I live with that depression my whole life, but i did a very good job hiding it, no one know i have it, because i always laughing and joking in class and at work. However, when the night come and i was alone with my thought, i always think of myself at a failure and i deserve to die, but i keep pushing on. I finally have a close group of friends, those that i can called my brothers, and thing was good, for a while.I had to move to the US with my family 3 years ago, leaving all my friends and my grandfather behind. In the US, i was alone, having no friend, my family scatter around, barely speaking the language and have to survive by myself, then the depression come back. There are many days that i want to end everything, but somehow i can still keep going. Everyday was as dark as the other, until the day i talked to her. She was my classmate in High school back in my country, we barely talk to each other on facebook, i used to like her back then but she already in a relationship so i didn't start anything then. One day i chatting her up on facebook, she told me about her divorce, how her husband treated her badly. I was there to talk to her, to share everything with her, and before i know it i fell in love with her, and she fell for me. We started a relationship, and those were the best days of my life. We can talk about everything, can joke about everything, we are just like best friend that love each other, everything was perfect. I waited for 6 months before i can comeback to my country to visit her and my friends. That 1 months with them i could never forget. After i got back to the US, i worked my ass off so i can build an actual future with her, and started to talk less because of my schedule. She told my that she was pregnant with my baby a month after i got back to the US, i was overjoy when heard that news. But bad thing keep happening to me, she had a miscarriage and lost our baby. We cried, a lot. Every night i dreamed of a kid who keep following me, i asked them who are they, and they told me ""Why can't i live with you and mom, why can't we be together?"". I cried my eyes out every single night. I tried to work harder so thing like that would never happen again, I thought that by doing it i can marry her and we can live together forever, but she thought that i was avoid her and no longer love her, but never tell me how she felt. There was that 1 extremely bad week when i was pressured by my school, my family, and my job, i barely sleep and had no energy to function. She also had a bad week and want to talk to me about it, however i was to tired to talk to her properly and i just half-assed talking to her. And that was the breaking point, she thought i no longer love her and her feeling for me started to go away. After that one week i began talking to her normally again, but she didn't seem like she want to talk. She said that she was sick and don't want to talk so i told her to remember to take her medicine, i dont want her to get sick, and i stopped calling her, yet still message her everyday. She never reply. One day I asked her and she told me that she no longer love me. The whole world crashing down on me. I begged, I cried, I explained to her everything, she wouldn't give me a chance. I was gonna ask her to marry me next summer, now everything is gone. I cried for the whole week, many time i was so close to commiting suicide but i held back because maybe i can still win her back. So I kept caring for her, talking to her although she never reply. I thought if I show her how much i really love her she will change her mind. Until one day i found out she already got a new lover before she broke up with me, and that crushed me. I asked her if she has anything going on with that person, and she agressively refused to answer. She told me that do i want to control her, that i always think what i want to think and never listen to her, she never did anything wrong, and she can answer it but she doesn't want to. My heart broke, i just want her to admit it herself so i know that she is still truthful with me, but she couldn't do it. I show her the proof and she change her tone, she said she couldn't lie to me so she couldn't said no. I felt like she has been lying to me for a long time. But i can't bring myself to be angry at her, i still love her so much. She came to me when i was in my darkest moments, she was the hope, the light that help me overcome everything. When she left, she took away all of that, now i'm alone with my own depression, when my mom saw me crying because of her, she told me to kill myself. I was closer to the edge than ever, i just want her back, i begged her and her new lover to let her comeback to me, that obviously failed. I talked to a lot of people, they all tell me that this will past, just try to forget her, everything will be fine .etc. I tried to go on with my normal life but she keep popping up in my head, her voice, her face, her smell, everything, and the depression hit. My kid comeback in my dream and asked me ""Why mom and dad fight? Why you are not together anymore?"". I tried to keep pushing on, I really did, but I can't imagine living a life without her. I can be working and studying 1 moment, and broke down the next moment because her memories came back in my head. I can't keep it going any longer and this time i think i will going through with it. All the pain and humiliation i suffered when i was young, the pain of being away from my friends, the pain of losing my kid, and the pain of losing my love, my hope is too much to bear any longer.I know that this is very long and there won't be anyone reading it, and it's fine, because i only want to say everything out so i can feel a bit relieve so i can concentrate on my plan.","1"

"I'm sick of living, the closest thing I have to a friend is a girl 1/3rds way across the word that I met online. I'm 18 and that's been enough of living for me to not want to anymore. I smoke stoges but I just looked it up and on average it takes 20 years for smokers to develop lung cancer, which is longer then I've been alive. The only reason I don't try to kill myself again is because my family says that it's selfish to do so which I get, like their plan was to be old and have a son to talk to but to me it's more selfish to bring me into the world and I reach a point that I'm so sick of living I would rather die then see if life gets better and say no stick around because it's selfish to make me go through this with out you, that's like dragging your kid out because you wanna do something but don't want to deal with finding friends. My only plan for the future is to go into the military so that in 30 years I can retire and just fake that I'm ok to get through and I have no cares anymore. I just realized the reason in impulsive is because I feel like nothing matters I'll die tomorrow but idk where I got this idea. Idk where to put this or who to talk to so I figured I'd put it on Reddit and see what people say.

"The funny thing is...I am a psychiatric nurse. A cowardly, hypocritical psychiatric nurse.  Tomorrow, I will discourage people from killing themselves, and spoon feed them the classics: ""suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem"", ""you matter""...In my own mind I believe none of it. In fact I really want to kill myself. I have a plan, and I have lethal means. I have ample time alone...I'm just missing the courage and frankly the energy. Life has gotten pretty bleak in the past 2 years.My dad has cancer and is in a coma. We were close. My fiance told me he no longer wishes to get married now...and that he'll ""let me know"" when he wants to get married. I took off a lot of time from work to care for dad...so financially I'm in bad shape. Work is torture because I am clinically depressed...dealing with people all day when you're depressed is a special kind of exhauating.No one really knows the extent of my depression.I ""Robin Williams"" (RIP)  my way thru the days I leave the house...I never let people see me sweat or cry...or even frown. They think I'm ""so strong"".If I can't do that I stay home. I stay in bed for hours and weep bitterly. It's all I can do.I want out. I don't see a point in me being an additional burden on my family. I just can't seem to feel good no matter what I do. I've tried most things...non-pharmocological things anyway. I don't want to take medications, but I'll try them at this point. I don't have high hopes for the meds but hell I'll try. I want to either have life be bearable or not to be here anymore.I actually, in the end, prefer dying. That way I won't have to endure the pain of loss ever again. I am a coward.The other day I found myself in deep envy of a corpse being wheeled to the morgue. I wished so much it could be me.I counsel people going thru worse all the time. Here I am running scared from my life which for all intents and purposes is decent, if u observe from the outside. Inside though it is the blackest of black and I can't deal. Yes I have folks to talk to...I am afraid even that has fallen short in helping me. Wish me luck...I don't know how this will end. Edit:Thank you three who took time and energy to comfort me. You all bought me to (greatful) tears and gave me strength enough to face a few more days. I'm definitely going to try the meds. I really hope they work.

"For the past 6 months, I've been contemplating suicide. I've done my research, looked thtough my options and writing everything down in a little diary. It made me feel ""better"" for a bit, that comforting feeling that takes over you when you know you won't be suffering for long. I was betrayed by friends, ignored by family when I tried asking for help without telling them I was suicidal, I started drinking every day, failing classes/skipping classes...The worst of all of it is not the pain, is not the hangover you get from drinking the day before, is not waking up and wishing you could go back to sleep because you felt a little happier dreaming, is not your mother screaming at you that you need to go to classes despite you told her you were so tired all the time and felt depressed and she told you that was not an excuse, it's not having a hard time sleeping because you always end up crying into the early hours in the morning, is not your friends not including you in conversations or inviting you to plans because ""well we thought you weren't going to come anyways""..it's that they all seem to not careNot care about why are you so sad, why are you so quiet, why haven't you been eating, why do you smell like alcohol, why are you so down...and I just don't understand why..I've always tried to be a good friend, ask is something is wrong, maybe buy a little chocolate or something when I see someone down and I know I can't do something to help, at least that will brighten up their day a little, I've always tried to go out of my way to help people, because sometimes, even if they don't say thank you, they appreciate it, I've been there..But right now, when I need it, there's no one there, no friends, no family, no nothingIs it that I've become so good at pretending I'm ok that they don't believe I'm depressed? do they just really don't care what happens to me? why? am I a bad person? maybe there's nothing in me that they can care about, I understand, you can't exactly get attached to something so quiet, maybe for the bestYesterday I went out and brought some clothes to myself for the first time in 4 years, I felt so happy, I've been through so much lately and this was a little treat to myself. I went to talk to the only person that I talk with nowadays to tell him about my day and show him my new clothes and for some reason he was mad, maybe not at me, but he just..brushed it off...I cried, I was so excited to tell him about it. I went from drinking everyday to 2-3 times a week, I'm picking up a bottle tomorrowI try so hard to convince myself that I shouldn't do it, but everyday, something just takes another piece of me, everyday it's a fight to find a reason to believe someone cares about me, I don't know how long I can last like this..sorry for rambling","1"
"My boyfriend is lying next to me, snoring and probably dreaming of our future. He looks so comfy wrapped up in the blankets and when I pet his head he gives me a sleepy smile. I love it when he sleeps without a shirt on, I love running my hand across his chest and feeling his skin.I have unread messages from my best friend of 7 years, who never really matured beyond 10 years old. She is only 8 days younger than me but her life is so care free, she has no interest in dating and therefore has no understanding of relationships or the problems that can come with them. She has no job, no responsibilities, no understanding of my depression and my struggles. Our conversations are very shallow because she simply doesnt understand what life is like as an adult. My other two friends are my boyfriend's friends. They are men, who think they know everything and try to fix my problems for me instead of listening. I feel like I can talk to no one. I have 4 siblings and a mom but we've all been so fucked up by years of torment and hate from her deceased ex that we dont know how to express emotions to each other. Im too afraid to go back to therapy because I feel abandoned by the ones who understood me most. A new job at a different place for them is earth shattering for me. How many times do I have to sit on a couch and tell my stories, how many times do I have to explain myself?I have a job that I cant decide if I hate, I spend most of my life there and when I come home I feel like Im not allowed to be myself. My boyfriend's grandma is a massive control freak and demands I spend all of my spare time with her watching tv. All she ever wants to talk about is how her grandson is a failure, how he's going to get fired, how he is lazy and fat and going to end up just like his meth addict mother. Some of what she says is true, sure, but if she were to stop yelling at him every day telling him he needs to change every aspect of himself I think things would improve. He tries his best as we all do. He has a bad memory but it doesnt make him a bad person and I think if she were to stop being so aggressive and instigating shit all the time she would see the better side of him.Im ranting I guessI want to die, and Im not even really sure if I want to die, but I dont know if I will ever be happy, or even okay. My mental health has improved so much over these last 6 years. I no longer have voices in my head, or visual hallucinations, or extreme paranoia. I dont explode over the littlest of things. Im actually able to have fun sometimes. So why do I still feel like something is wrong? Something broken inside me that makes me incapable of having a normal life.Whenever I think about killing myself I think of the deaths of my dad and step dad. They both killed themselves. Not with a gun or a noose or a knife, or even intentionally, but they killed themselves. My step dad was a horribly abusive man, even before he got into heroin. Earlier this year in March, on my mother's birthday, he had an overdose in our bathroom. His son, biological son and the only one of us who actually gave a damn about him, heard him gasping for air and found him slumped over of the toilet with a needle in his arm. He called my mom who came home from work and called 911. I woke up to her coming into my room asking for help. Her and I had to get this 400 lb man off of the toilet and onto the floor of our tiny bathroom while we waited for the paramedics arrived. We did it, somehow, and it took three paramedics to drag him into the living room. There were probably 20 emergency people jammed into our living room, either writing on clipboards or working on him trying to save his life. They did. They gave him some sort of counter active injection and all screamed his name. He shot up from the floor asking ""what?"" as if waking up from a nap. He didnt want to go to the hospital. I screamed at him ""you can die, but youre not going to die here in front of your sons!"". He said nothing. He went to the hospital. I went to my boyfriend's house. He was home before dinner that night. My mom let him sleep there then kicked him out the next morning. Two days after my mother's birthday she found him dead in the back of his car in a Lowe's parking lot. He died from another overdose.Almost exactly a month later I found out my dad was dying. I hadnt seen or heard from him in almost 10 years but I decided I wanted to see him. My mother, my sister and I drove 13 hours straight. He was yellow and swollen. His liver had finally given out after over 30 years of drinking. His brain wasnt working right either so he didnt recognize us at first. He keot calling my mom and my sister the wrong names. The only reason he got mine right is because I have red hair. He had less than 6 months to live. He could barely walk. He had a bruise going from his wrist to his elbow because he had fallen on it. The transfered him to a hospice. He died three months later. He chose alcohol over me. He never called, never made an effort to see his kids. When the thing he picked over his family was killing him he blamed us for not seeing him. The last time I had saw him I was 8, and he was so drunk that he did not remember who I was. Sorry for not chasing you, dad.Im lying here right now, thinking about killing myself. Thinking that I just want something to change. Thinking that I want to run away and start over, but knowing that I cant. Knowing that if I killed myself, no matter how long of a note I wrote begging my family and friends not to blame themselves; they would. Knowing they could never ask me why I did it. They could never ask me anything, ever again. Thinking that I dont want to go to work tomorrow. Thinking that Im not good enough for this man lying next to me. Thinking that no matter what, I will never be happy.","1"
"Just want to vent here. I was born into a fairly well-to-do family into one of the top 5 counties for public education. I'd say that I'm at a slightly above average intelligence because before depression hit me I was taking the highest level IB classes with minimum effort. I know that I sound narcissistic and vain, but I'll talk about that later. I feel like I've always been depressed my entire life but it's only taken into full effect now (at 16 and a half). My dad had (maybe still has) depression and I know that it can be genetically inherited. I've got to say that it's hit me like a train. A year ago, my mind was racing at a million miles a second. I didn't have to put any effort into school. I was so efficient that I was able to finish homework IN class. Now I just sit there in class either spacing out or wallowing in my self-pitying mind. I know that it sounds cliche but it feels like there's  a layer of fog in my brain. My thought processes are sluggish and things aren't making sense. I've pushed all of my friends away from me but it wasn't on purpose. I just lost all of my energy and motivation to do anything. I'm beginning to fall behind in classes and I skipped a week of school prior to Thanksgiving. On top of that my anxiety has been almost rendering me immobile. I'm paralyzed with worries that I know are irrational yet I still can't shake them off. On top of that I've developed a gambling addiction. I'm $500 down the drain and that isn't a big problem for me at the moment but in the future that $500 is going to be $5,000 and then $50,000. The only other thing that has been keeping me from suicide at the moment is my future and I feel that dimming slowly as my grades continue to dip. I recognize my superiority complex and I'm watching it all crash down right in front of me. Going from the top in my class to getting so brain fogged that it takes time for me to finish my sentences is really hitting me. Honestly I don't even know if it's worth living out my life. I know it's going to be filled with a whole of of sorrow solely based on my current  mental circumstances. I've tried to fix them (therapist) but nothing is working. My parents refuse to out me on antidepressants. I can see my depression, anxiety, and gambling addiction screwing me over in the future. It's eminent. Every night I ponder if I should just kill myself now and save me the future misery. Life right now is unlivable. I've  got constant butterflies in my stomach worrying about nothing and I know that it won't get better. ","1"
"Brody, brody was a strange kid. He didn't have any friends at hiss school, sat alone in class, doesn't talk much, never went out. Nobody knew anything about him. No one wanted to talk to him. Brody hates everyone. Nobody would miss brody if he disappeared, nobody would notice. Why would anyone care about brody anyways. He's a loser, freak, wannabe. Nobody likes brody. Brody doesn't like anybody, especially himself. Why should brody live anymore?","1"
"Even though i love the subject which i have taken up for my Masters(wildlife conservation), ADHD has prevented me from enjoying it fully or realizing my potential to the fullest. The way i see it, i have only 2 options-stop wasting my parents' money, and take up a pathetic job which pays me little and turns me into a social outcast, or kill myself. I really don't want to hurt my family even though they are insensitive to my condition. But i can't go in for therapy, and ADHD will burden me forever, so i will have to give up on my academic career. I feel ashamed even while writing this, at my age, i should be doing a lot better.

"My life isn't even that bad, it just feels bad. Awful really. My family really sucks though, I can't talk to them for the life of me. They don't really pay attention to me either. Just my younger sister(15) and they always compare me to her. My birthday is coming up, I'll be turning 17 in just a few weeks, I've wanted to kill myself on my birthday for awhile now. I've been in a depressive episode(bipolar disorder 2) for almost a year now, I stopped taking my medication because I'd rather feel depressed than numb- the funniest part is I still want to kill myself on my medication. I talked to my psychiatrist about it and he just uped my dose. It did nothing. I think I'm going to just celebrate on my birthday, write my letters and then //method// I sort of just wish I was alone. I kind of am thinking about breaking up with my boyfriend so he doesn't feel as effected by me killing myself, maybe he'll resent me. I wish I was lonely.","1"

"hey guys, new to this sub Reddit, and actually Reddit in general. I never thought I'd make a post like this, but things happen. I'm a happy person, I live a good life, but a lot of things are missing. About a month ago, I had my first panic attack, and for a week after I was severely dehydrated due to vomiting, and could barely move due to my anxiety. I've had anxiety all my life, im 20 years old, but it's never been that bad. Things got better, I was recovering. Now, just recently, I went on a road trip, and during it I was getting really nervous, remembering my panic attack and was afraid it would happen again. That night while trying to sleep I had my very first suicidal thought, and it felt like I didn't even want it, it just happened. Now I've been having invasive thoughts of suicide, like when I'm unoccupied? Usually I love being alone, but now when I am I'm just scared of killing myself? I don't want to at all, but it's in my head for some reason. I've never gotten help for anything, and haven't even been to a doctor in ten years almost. But maybe I should change that and get help?I'm fine, but it's really scary to keep having thoughts like this. Just wanted to know if I'll get better. Thank you whoever is reading!:)","1"

"It's been a month and a half since I reconnected with this person, she has manipulated me into giving her lots of money, money that I needed to pay my car and my studies for this month, if she doesn't give me it back I don't know what I will do.She told me that she inherited some money but needed to pay for the documents in order to get it. I helped, then she asked for more because they were asking more from her, I helped... it's been a month of this, I am an idiot because I trusted her, because how would someone do something like this? I was happy for her, to help her but after almost months... this can't be anything more than an scam.She says that she loves me, we are a ""couple"" and well I have fallen for her idk if I felt because it was scary to lose contact with her meaning that I would lose the money but now... I don't know what to do...Yes, I'm an idiot, who in their sane mind would have trusted in someone like that? but I felt like I mattered that helping someone was something good. I felt loved... now she tells me that she is trying to get her money in order to pay me, but when I ask for proof she says that I don't trust her that she isn't some scammer.I have seen her cry in front of me, after I told her my preoccupations, that she cares for me, that we can have a future together... but the last couple days have been the worst... every time I talk we end up fighting...She knows about my depression, she knows that I have tried to kill myself, she says that I'm just playing the victim card... I told her that on Tuesday I'm going to kill myself... I'm afraid that I will do it.I'm not in the US so I don't thing the law here can help me, in the end it has been all my fault. I deserve this, I don't have anything left, my car isn't mine, I'm afraid that by not paying my debts I may end up in jail... Idk... I don't have much energy left, I don't know how to get help.I feel that this is what God has for me, the last push to the wrong side, the last string... this is the worse I have ever felt... I'm really scared... Sorry for being a failure, but I won't ever get better, lo siento pero tengan por seguro que los amo, los amo con toda mi alma y espero continen con sus vidas que este dolor que les voy a provocar no sea uno que no puedan superar. No pude pedir por una mejor familia y lamento no pedirles ayuda pero no quiero que se preocupen... por ms estpido que eso se escuche.Los amo, y lo siento","1"
"So things have been too hard lately. I'm 17, almost 18. Just lost my job of two and a half years. My parents don't trust me nearly as much anymore. My grades are slipping and I have two F's. I was supposed to be a smart kid. I got suspended at school when I was only trying to help a kid by returning their bag, but administrators didn't understand. I have no motivation now. The one piece keeping me intact was a girl. My home coming date, probably my best friend, and more. We went to a concert together last time and got fucked up. It's all I wanted. With all the other people grinding around us and guys trying to grind with her, she tells me ""hey, I can't grind with you. You're like a brother to me"". I could talk for hours about her but the bottom line is she's never gonna care the same way, and it's gonna hurt too much to remain as friends. Everything else is going so shitty and I don't know where to turn. After she said that I played it off and slowly worked into the crowd until someone gave me Molly and I just felt so much more amplified and sad. She made sure I got home, but I think that's the end. The plan is to take as many pills as I can while closing the hot tub cover on myself so when I fall asleep I will quickly drown too being a skinny motherfucker. I hope everyone has a good life, and I wish I could've impacted some of you strangers. And I've accepted it. I love you Anna. Goodbye.","1"
"Waking up makes me want to cry but I can't because I need to pull myself together to go to work, my family can't see me cry because they do not believe in mental illness and get mad at me for not being okay so I play along to the meaning of my name Abigail - fountain of joy, they refuse to believe I am anything but okay. I have a couple friends but I feel deeply in my heart that they do not know who I am even after the seemingly deep connections we have made. The person I love the most, my only reason to smile most days can never love me back but it's okay because he needs to be happy and all I want is for him to be free. But none of these friends live near me, everyone is far away but being close wouldn't fix my problems. The best of days is still shadowed by depression, anxiety, violent suicidal thoughts and compulsions, I hate my body, my face my mind for how sick it is. I've been here before many times. Got so high and saw the silver lining but I'm beginning to think that life at its core is not for me. This all sounds dramatic and whiny, obviously I have so much to be thankful for but I am so sick. Life is just circles. Loving with my whole heart and being rejected on every side and every level. Self harm isn't enough nothing is enough I hurt so deeply in my soul. I want to go home but I do not have one. Someone else deserves this life not me I cannot appreciate it here, life is a restless sleep full of night terrors. I don't know what is real everything spins all the time. ","1"

It was all my fault and i had to call my parents to come get me. It took months for me to convince my dad to let me drive on my own and Im normally so much better but I just fucked up today and I feel terrible. I dont know if theyll ever let me drive on my own now but I cant afford a new car and where I live its impossible to survive without one.I finished high school a few weeks ago and now Im just working food service. I have goals and I have interests but I just cant find the energy and patience to pursue them and it makes me feel terrible. I really think Ive given up every hobby Ive ever tried to pursue. I just feel bad about myself in every way possible right now. I cant believe I fucked up as badly as I did today and it makes me feel terrible. I just think so lowly of myself and I dont want to anymore. I dont want to kill myself but I really cant find another option anymore because I have been pushing a shitty life to the limits and Im so close to just ending it. Can someone please help me??Edit: Ive already had 800mg ibuprofen for the pain from the crash and Im scared Im not gonna be able to keep myself from taking more","1"
"Basically my life consists of two things, schoolwork and the typical distractions to said schoolwork that a college kid would have access to. Drugs, alcohol, etc.I feel like I have very little time for fun outside of school and my parents have been pressuring me to get a job which I just do not feel like I can take on right now with my course load. So I get depressed because I know deep down that my parents are disappointed in me and I can only think about the debt I'm putting myself into by choosing to go into college straight out of high school with little scholarship support.In direct result of this I medicate with drugs/alcohol/fast food and I just feel disgusting all the time.

"It's been months ago since I seriously thought of ending my life. I've been depressed for more than 5 years but I never bothered to get myself solutions until recently, which was 6 months ago. I went to therapy for about 2 months but I had to stop due to logistical reasons. I found a replacement therapist but I cancelled my appointment the last minute. I thought I was getting better -- I'm going out more often, I'm more willing to meet and trust new people, I'm starting to like myself again, I'm functioning like _normal_. But I viewed everything through rose-colored glasses. I'm not getting better. I didn't get any progress. I didn't gain friends. I've built this delusion of belongingness and family that I thought I've steered away from the demons in my head. They're still here. They never left and I just made things worse. I hate myself. My _friends_ are better off without someone like me in their life. The world is infinitely a better place without me in it. The voices are back and I just want them to stop. ","1"
"I've been suicidal for most of my life, but it's time. I'm exhausted. I'm a transgender guy, and I have my surgery scheduled, but honestly, I just can't wait any longer. I'm afraid that even when I do have it, I'll be so used to being depressed, that I still won't be able to escape it. I've done really well in school, and I'm starting to see some professional success, but I keep fucking it up because I have no motivation and waste large chunks of time just laying there at home. I can't tolerate being sober, and I spend all day just waiting to get home and get high or drunk. I feel sick constantly because of this, but I also can't stop. I look at my life and imagine everything going perfectly and having everything I could ever want, and yet, I don't even want that. Nothing is exciting, nothing feels good or enjoyable. My sex drive is low, food tastes bad. And I'm alone. It's just time.","1"

I'm not really depressed either, I'm not happy and I'm kinda just sad and dull, I just don't want to be alive. The only time I'm happy is when I'm high, but everyone judges me for that a lot.

I can't get myself to work on school project, i'm always late or never finishing college assignments. I've got an awesome part time job, yet I the happiness mask i put on there won't last. I can't talk to anyone anymore, I pushed so many people out of my life because of depressionI feel like the worst shit for complaining, because i've been so lucky in life in general ; I don't know if i'll be able to survive through all of it. I'm sure I can, yet I won't get out of bed and change it. I think of suicide all of the time. I can't even go through an entire hour of class because the tears just come, I can't stop them. I've been to therapy before, it helped, but almost my whole family is suffering from depression too and they refuse to admit it, I can't continue, i'm trying to help but it's dragging me down to, just as i drag down the friends that want to help me. I want them to understand that it's serious. I hate this fucking illness, what's the point if it's always going to be there (I know, getting help &meds can help, but one slip and you're back in hell) I've stopped school before because of depression, and i came back after a year to be able to get better. But It's my last chance. I'm so weak. I'm afraid i'll do it soon.. It hurts to be alone. I even tried to reach out, in my own way, to tell that I'm at the bottom ; Via social media, on my art account. It was pretty self-explanatory. The only answer I got was a question about the painting brush used. Stupid thing to doBut I can't reach out now, can I ? After it's done, they're always saying ""Oh, she should have talked to me about it"" or things like that. When I try, I lose friends, I lose confidence, people's esteem.

"Hey. So, a whole bunch of things have happened to me recently. I moved out of my dad's (I'm in high school still and it's awkward, cause I can't just split from the rest of my extended family), while my mom is an alcoholic, albeit a functioning one. It's not like she beats me or anything now, but when she used to get drunk she would verbally abuse me, and I just fucking hate seeing her drink, it makes me really really on edge. She tries to conceal it, too, but it's pretty obvious when you've had to be aware of it most of your life. I can't talk to her about it either, just 'cause I'm barely hanging on as it is. I just can't bring another problem on the table. I also am probably getting rid of my horse and I'm not sure if I'll have the financial means to get another one. I know that sounds like the stupidest problem, but horses are my biggest passion, and I've put everything I have into learning to train them and raise them. My goal is to raise them for a living and become an Olympic rider. I've been doing it most of my life, and in some other depressive periods, it's what kept me going, and really the only reason I had to live.I guess the pile up of everything has triggered another depressive episode. I don't know. I do know I want to die. There's not much stopping me, and there's nothing to hang on for. If you're gonna say family or something along those lines, not to be brash, but I don't care. People are not a good reason to keep living, because over time, things change, and they're just not reliable. I've got one person who I might want to keep living for, but the happiness I feel with them doesn't compare to how much I fucking hate living on other days. Everything just feels so fake and not real and so...not worth it. Like everything is used up and so forseeable and why would I continue living for that? It's a weird sense to describe, but just the idea that nothing is real, not like, not real in this plane, but not genuine. So the feeling nothing is genuine. Like I look out over a beautiful sunset or something that used to really make me happy just to notice it, and I feel nothing. I spent 5 hours the other night contemplating a plan for suicide, and I know what I'd do. I don't really want to die but I don't know what to do next. ","1"

"Last night I snuck out of my house, didn't tell anyone where I was going, brought a razor with me, and headed down to the docks in my town. I sat there for maybe three hours just doing nothing but thinking about if i should do it. The only thing that stopped me was that my mother would have to wait to find out what happened to me.I recently broke up with my abusive boyfriend but he won't leave my life. I feel so trapped. He told me that if I leave for good he'll kill himself, and I can't be responsible for a death. Even if he hurt me a lot, I still care about him and want him to be okay. After we broke up I just let guys use me for sex. Cause why not honestly. I know that no one will ever love me or actually want me. My ex told me he just stayed cause he was scared of being alone. I knew that all along. So I've just been hooking up with anyone who wants it to feel like someone likes me even for a second. It just makes me feel worse in the end, and confirms the suspicions that no one actually wants me, or ever will.I was raped by a boy at my school two years ago and to this day no one believes me. Anytime I think someone may actually like me they find out I'm the ""false rape girl"" and suddenly they're gone. I just want it to all be over.I'm under massive stress from school, joining the IB program was a mistake. Anyone who's taken it or known someone who did will know how incredibly stressful it is. All I do is work, I have no time whatsoever to relax. I'm not doing amazing either, so I'm terrified that I may not graduate high school because I overestimated myself. I feel so incredibly fucking stupid. I'm going nowhere in life and I fucking know it. I live with my abusive step father and can't leave my room when he's not at work. He just makes fun of me yells and puts me down. Started cutting myself again recently and it doesn't even make me feel better anymore but I do it anyway. I don't feel much of anything.Things are bad. I'm too young for things to be this bad. I'm too fucking burned out and tired of my life for 16. I feel like this is how I'm gonna feel forever. I've been miserable since my dad died when i was 11 and I don't think it'll ever change. I just want it all to end.","1"

"If you read this, thank you, I know it's a shit show mess of a post.So I'm 27 years old (soon to be 28) and I've really been struggling mentally lately. I graduated college in 2012 with a degree in Communications. I get embarrassed when people ask me what I majored in because Comm is seen as a joke and all my friends did stuff like Econ, Engineering, or CS. I'm basically the dude everyone jokes about that peaked in high school.All my friends have great paying jobs and I see them post from vacations abroad with their significant other and I get so jealous. I had two jobs from 2012-2016 that were really low paying and basically all I could do was afford rent and groceries. I was a fucking idiot and even though I know I'm smart I took the easy way out in college and spent most of my time partying.I'm 27 and I've never had a girlfriend although I've hooked up with girls before, so I'm not like 100% loser, just like 99% loser. Up until like 2013ish or 2014 I was really sociable until I kinda just started this downward spiral towards depression. I've since gained weight, i'm like 50lbs overweight and I hardly ever go out anymore. I don't remember the last time I actually have seen a friend in person. I chat all the time with them through text or facebook chat. It's tough though because all my close friends moved to San Francisco for jobs while my first job was in SoCal.This next part I'm really embarrassed to even type out, but I was just browsing Instagram when I came across this photo of this girl who I guess is like an internet celebrity and I instantly just like fell in love. Now I know I'm not actually in love with her, I don't even know her, I'm more in love with the idea of the girl. And we live like 1500 miles apart, I'll never meet this girl in person.So I actually started working out this month because I thought, ""a girl like that would never want a pathetic loser like me"", and every time I'm at the gym and get tired and want to quit and just think ""do it for [insert that girls name]"" (how fucking pathetic am I?) and I keep going. Seems to have worked, I've lost almost 5lbs since Nov 1st. And then this week I made the mistake of like creeping on all her IG photos, and I found some pictures of her and her ex-bf and I saw the way she was looking at him in the photos and was just like, ""wow a girl has never looked at me the way she's looking at this guy"". And i just started crying, like legit bawling my eyes out. First time I've cried since my grandpa died when I was 13. How fucking pathetic is that? If you don't know the look I'm describing just take a look at /r/girlsmirin I check her IG or Twitter every night before I go to sleep...who am I kidding I check them multiple times a day to keep me motivated to go to the gym or to take my coffee black with no creamer or to eat half as much as I normally eat.Also I forgot to mention, part of the reason I gained the weight was I was rear-ended on the freeway in 2013 by a dude texting and driving. Since then I've basically been in constant pain. Back pain and shooting leg pain. Ever day getting out of bed is an ordeal. I've been working out on and off because it's like a catch-22. Doctors say I need to workout to get better, but working out causes me pain. If I work out consistently the pain does start to go away but then I get lazy again. I know I probably should stop creeping this girls Instagram pics every day but it's the only thing that is motivating me right now.In 2014 I took a job out of state and stayed there till January 2016. It was in the midwest and I literally had no friends other than the two random roommates who I found on craigslist when I moved there. But they were a couple so I was mostly third wheeling it whenever we went out. So for two years I basically just worked this shit job 6am-7pm, 6 days a week, and just came home and did nothing and talked to nobody.I thought maybe I should just kill myself, nobody would miss me most likely. I ended up getting a puppy instead. At least he loves me. But that's just cuz I give him food and take care of him. But at least that's something that cares about me.I finally felt like I was going to lose my mind working that job so I just quit and moved back home into my mom's house. I've been here ever since, unemployed. A fucking pathetic loser. I'm seriously just a waste of space.I took a couple computer science classes this year and I just got accepted into Oregon State's online post-bacc CS program staring in January 2018. Reading the reviews online maybe I'll be able to get through it and get a real job like my friends and actually earn money and not just be a loser.But still that's at least a year or two away from being done. So I'll be like 30 years old. Still probably will have never had a girlfriend or anyone love me, except my dog. Just wonder if it'd be easier to end it. Probably won't cuz of my dog.Literally all I do every day while people are out being productive is take my dog to the dog park, except wednesdays when it's closed although sometimes I take him to the dog park a couple towns over cuz it's open on wednesdays, go to the gym (as of this month), take a couple CS classes at my local community college, run my shitty online business. Wow so much to write home about. I'm embarrassed anytime anybody asks me for an update on what I'm up to.I don't think I could actually kill myself cuz I'm too much of a coward. Plus the thought of my dog being abandoned makes me sad. If you read all of this, thank you. And sorry. I'm sure reading this was a real joy ^/stl;dr : my life is pointless, probably wont' end it just cuz of my dog tho. also i'm a coward.","1"
"Ive been on thanksgiving break since monday. i spent most of it sobbing in my room following a fight with my family. Tomorrow, classes resume, and I honestly cant handle it.I dont have any friends.When i say that, it is not an exaggeration. I eat alone in the bathroom at lunch. Ride the bus alone (because even though im a senior im unable to drive). I have a group project with girls i dont know and was put in a group with rather than picked because no one fucking wants me.No one is really outright mean to me but i know they all think im weird.Probably the thing i fear most is people actually talking to me. Its even harder than just being alone, when someone tries to talk to me and i have to watch them slowly realize im not actually worth their time over the course of the exchange.All day, i cry on and off. I lament my need to binge (raging unchecked bulimia), I lament my need for a cigarette (ah, addiction), and i lament the constant and inescapable crippling dread that comes with social interaction.Knowing m gonna have to put on a smile when staff members ask how I am.Knowing ill have to pretend i understand the material being taught to me.Knowing im not gonna graduate anyway and furthermore knowing it doesnt matter because im too worthless and incompetent to ever hold a job and too poor and stupid to further my education.Its all too much. Its just too much. ","1"

"Im just so done with life these past few months. I didn't get into University this year and I'm taking the year to upgrade a few classes and work. Yesterday I wanted to go to the movies at 10 with a few friends so i told my parents and my dad went off on how I'm never going to get into uni and how I'm a dumbass and stuff and then they kicked me out of my house so i drove over to my girlfriends house and stayed there for a few hours. Im always considered dumb in my family, my brother is praised for his 4.0 gpa and I'm always either getting shaded or being made fun of. I hate it. I hate waking up and feeling like shit. I was so close to ending it yesterday. I honestly think I am going to end it really soon because of the burden i am. I just want to be in peace and not be scared of getting made fun of or in trouble every minute. ","1"
"Im very depressed and anxious, but I know my mom would never let me get depression pills to help treat it, even though my dad is mental also so I believe it runs in the family. So I guess I have to deal with it all on my own. My mom doesnt even know how I feel, she never asks so what does it matter. Honestly couldnt care less, she never lets me see my dad and I know he loves me and it hurts. I know that when he dies Ill regret not seeing him while hes here. If Im gone I wont have to deal with that though, so thats a plus.","1"
"Okay so long story short, last summer was a train wreak. I was depressed, suicidal, cutting, angry, doing drugs, sneaking out ect. I thought I wasn't going to get caught but eventually I did. My parents were pissed off to the max as you could imagine. I was rebellious and abusive towards them because I was so angry. I had been in trouble with the police for being caught with weed and stealing from stores/cars with ""friends"". I ended up going to the behavioral health unit of the Hospital 2 times in a month and the state was threatening me with sending me to a group home because of my past legal history. I ran away to a ""friends"" house thinking I would never be found, but the police found me and took me home after about a week. My parents were upset and said awful things to me. I understand because I did awful things to them too. They said they would never trust me again, and that hurt. My trust with them is completely broken. I was raped and they wont believe me. I need advice on how to repair that trust and how to make them believe in me and love me again. I have no friends, no one to talk to. The only person who I felt cared is gone... I dont know what to do anymore. i cant eat, im failing in school, im depressed and angry and fuck i cant . i just want to end it all. Sometimes I miss the people i used to hang out with because I actually fit in when i hung out with them, and i was ""Happy"". I miss them so much. But they wont let me see them anymore and my life is hell because i made it hell.Please help me fix this...","1"
"Read it or not. This is what's in my head. I'm telling you, reddit, because I haven't told anyone else.For the better part of 20 years, I have been struggling with depression. I learned early on that suicidal threats or actions get your ass hauled to the hospital, and I cannot and will not do that again. So when I go to my psychiatrist or any other doctor these days, I just lie. I don't tell them things like:1. I think about killing myself or being dead several times a day, without fail.2. Sometimes it's a fun fantasy to think about getting instantly vaporized by a nuke or crushed by a building.3. I've imagined what people will say if I'm dead, and all I can think about is everyone saying, ""Oh, him? He shot himself.""4. Sometimes when I'm driving on the highway and the thoughts are particularly bad, I unbuckle my seatbelt and wrap it around my neck. I give myself bonus points if I can bring myself to let go of the wheel for a second or two.5. I honestly did not think I would ever be this old, and now I don't know what to do.I've tried every medication ever, years of therapy, and more. It was really just this year when I resigned myself to the fact that this isn't going away and I'm going to live out the rest of my life wanting to die every day. I guess the real reason I haven't told anyone is that I still want to have the option if I want to check out later. But who am I kidding? I don't have the balls to actually do it. ","1"
"Title doesn't make sense, I apologize.I really don't like myself.Therapy clearly did nothing. I will never EVER be normal or functional, I can't have a romantic relationship and now apparently I can't even keep my FAMILY around because I can't stop having outbursts. I thought therapy would fix me, I thought I was on track to being nice and normal and everything would be in the past.People like me just shouldn't be allowed into the world, where they will inevitably go back to hurting others. I hate me, everyone hates me. There's no point in being alive if you have no one. ","1"
"I'm a 20 yr girl with Borderline Personality Disorder, and what scares me the most is time.I have thought about killing myself for so long, now I would feel afraid if I don't have that thought, it became my comfort, that it's my ultimate solution for my problems. But every day, I tried a little bit more, I still hope and pray to God, one day, something will change, I will be a better person than I am, things will be different. But I can't keep up with time, I forgot how to feel real, how to pay attention, I lost track of time, feels like i were asleep for the whole day, from moment to moment, I woke up and wonder where my time went, realize nothing were changed, I didn't make any improvement so I can go back to school, go back to be functioning normally during the day or in life. It kills me every day, but I can't do anything but staring helplessly, I just want to feel something, just one bit of happiness, I wish something powerful would come into my dream and tell me ""everything will be ok, I got you!"". I convinced myself I was stronger I than I thought, I don't need anyone to help me, I'm not lonely or stupid, just sick, but I think I'm ""a bit"" tired! This is not what life should be, it's not constant cutting or crying myself to sleep at night, not being afraid of time passing by so fast, not being covered by anger, sadness, emptiness, fear or hopelessness. But i too, want to live happily, why can't I do it?","1"

"So I'm pretty sure I'm going to end it all tonight.  I made an attempt a few days ago and it didn't work.  I'm going to overdose and slit my wrists in the bathroom tonight once my roommate and suit mates are asleep.  I've thought about reaching out to someone, but I can't talk to my family (they don't take mental health seriously at all).  I've briefly debated calling a hotline but I've just heard horror stories.  The more I debate it the more I know this is what should happen.  I've said goodbye to everyone.  I've written up my will.  I've made all the preparations so everything will go smoothly.  I'm not writing this for attention, or to get replies like 'don't do this.'  'you have so much to live for.'  or any other shit like that.  I'm calm.  I actually hope no one comments on this at all.  I just figured I'd at least 'say my plan out loud'.  Typing it out makes it more real to me... idk why.  I'm just fucking tired.  My life has absolutely put me through the ringer and I'm ready to fall asleep and not wake up.  But yeah, I guess that's all.  So here ends what many people will think of as yet another selfish, shallow, meaningless cry for attention.  Maybe it is a cry for attention... either way... this is my plan.","1"
"Every day, every hour, I somehow daydream and imagine committing suicide, the place, time, method, my note, and what I'm feeling, seeing, and thinking. But then once I stop daydreaming and come back to reality I feel fear, fear of the physical pain that will come from whatever method I choose to commit suicide with, whether it's a quick painless death, or long and excruciating one. And I'm most afraid of is if I fail. If I manage to survive, and whether I become crippled and/or retarded from the brain damage and I become more of a burden to others. My cowardice is what's keeping me alive.","1"

"I'm in my early 30s, I'm a college graduate and had a decent career going into government/ politics. I was on track to have  a lot of opportunities and on the path to a nice job making good money in an amazing city and state until two years when I let my head get the best of me and I wouldn't leave my room work weeks at a time and spot going to work until I was fired in March of 2016. I lost all of my professional networks. People I can ask for recommendations, my reputation is irreparable. I lost a huge part of my identity. I had a prestigious position. Especially for someone from out of state with zero family or university connections. Even my parents were surprised I earned the position I had.I hospitalized involuntarily. I slugged along not working for a year. I took a class at a community college in a trade but dropped it because I was really shitty at the work I lacked natural talent in the field and was too embarrassed to ask for extra help and unmotivated to put in the effort. Then last fall I decided to pick myself up I started to eat healthier and exercise. I lost 25+ lbs that I had gained in the last few years. I went to therapy and was on medication. I started to reach out to friends I had cut myself off from. I took a job washing dishes for a 2 months period after Christmas and worked for my hands off. Literally, they were wrecked. I was an awesome employee. I won an award for being such a good employee. I was in talks with someone to run a new non-profit. I had a way to hopefully repair my working reputation. I was excited about the work. I had a sense of purpose. I was rebuilding a part of my identity I had lost. But the job did not work out.After that job didnt work out I started to spiral downward. Gained back all the weight I lost. I started isolating myself again. I have had 2 interviews for 2 jobs I was qualified for but failed to get one that was entry level. I prepped for the interviews. Asked people who previously worked at the company for advice. Prepped questions I thought they would ask and composed responses. I prepared questions to ask. I created a 4-page document to help me prepare for the interview. But failed.I have applied for 6 jobs in the last two months that I am qualified for and heard nothing. People are looking over my resume before I send it in and say it looks good. I have 6 years of experience in public policy/ government but it is very specific to the state I live in now. A lot of non-profit openings are for development which I have minimal experience and would only be qualified for such a position after unpaid or low paid internships. I did an internship to get my foot in the door initially. I worked 2 jobs 60+ hours a week. I dont think I have the motivation to do that again just to get my foot in the door.Unemployment in the low 4% in my state and I can't get hired as a barista. I have applied to 3 coffee shops. Got one interview but zero job offers.I'm broke. I need to file for bankruptcy because I am $40,000 in debt. My bank account is negative. I am selling my car to pay rent. Without a car, my job search is limited to a smaller area that is accessible via my bike, walking, or public transportation. All my options going forward are bleak. I will never be able to have the life I want. The chances of getting back into my career are slim. My future earning potential is low. I have no retirement savings, Im getting priced out of my neighbor by rising rent. The hobbies I had are too expensive for me to participate in now. There is nothing that gives me purpose, or happiness or even contentment. My question is why is now not the appropriate time to give up? Ive tried and I failed. I have lost a major part of my identity. I have no one that depends on me financially. Im ready to quit.","1"

I wish that I had killed myself long ago. This world is madness. Even if I could I wouldn't want to fit in. I'd rather die. Maybe I should. Maybe I will. I'm more alone now than I ever have been.

"Objectively, I have no reason to hate myself or feel the way I do. I have a job, a girlfriend who loves me, friends who support me, etc. But it all feels so meaningless and fake. I feel like every person I meet just wants to use me or doesn't care about me. Most of the time I think my friends are just my friend because it's easy. I don't ever see them except for band practice. No one texts me regularly except my girlfriend. I feel empty inside. I had goals and aspirations but I think I've lost those and I don't know how to get my drive back. I lost my dream job and now I'm working a job that I despise just to pay bills. However, I can't even do that because despite working full time, I don't make enough to cover all of them, so I'm always having to ask for help from my family whom I'm almost certain think I'm a huge disappointment at this point. I just feel worthless. Like this is all I'm good for. I don't deserve anything good in my life. Suicide used to scare me, but now it's starting to seem like a viable option.

" I am stupid. I'm failing two classes, I'm such a sack of shit. I'm a statistics major and I'm failing pre-calc. I have to take up to differential equations and then a programming class..I'm such a failure, how the fuck do I expect to do that? The other class I'm failing is fucking economics, how does that happen? I hate myself, I hate myself so fucking much. Finals week is about 20 days away, everytime I calm myself down about this I freak out and have another panic attack over these classes. And no, I can't drop them and I never could. I have a scholarship where I need to take at least 12 credits and if I go below I have to pay for the missing credits (1,000 dollars per credit).  I'm such a failure, I hate myself so much.  I got a 45% on my second economics quiz, and no they don't drop the lowest test. I hate myself, I hate that I'm such a stupid fuck up. All I do is fail everything. All I am is a worthless sack of shit who will amount to nothing. I keep swinging back between having bulimia and not having it, I feel guilty whenever I purge but at the same time I feel like a failure if I don't. I purge to the point where I see blood but that's not enough, it's never enough. I'm still ugly.  I have a panic attack when I eat and don't purge, I feel like I ruined my life. Whenever I look in the mirror I cry, I have beautiful family, beautiful sisters, beautiful aunts and cousins and then there's me. I'm a waste of space, I'm an eyesore. I lost the genetics lottery.  I spend 200 dollars on makeup monthly, 500 dollars on clothes monthly, yet I'm still a sack of shit. I'm still ugly and nothing will fix that. I want to cut my skin off, I want to hide every mirror I see. I hate that I'm the ugly sister the ""WOW, are they really related to you?"" comments.

But I have had a couple heartbreaks in the last couple years. I don't feel like I am any use to anyone. I actually feel like I hinder people now. I have taken one of my friends on a spiral of drink and drugs with me as he's tried to be there for me. It's shit to see for him.I've had fights and arguments with my mother and other friends through what I think in hindsight is my behaiour. It's hard to tell as I don't see what I've done wrong and most of the time think I'm right or hard done by. But by afterthought or seeing others go through this I guess I see maybe I am the common problem. I'm the one that always has the issue or causes the issues. I guess I have depression. My latest ex tried to get me to see someone about it. But I've never felt I'd need to do that. In fact 5 years ago I was the least likely guy to ever have to do that. I've always been the one to be there for everyone. The constant happy guy. The party guy. The helping guy. The guy who would pick you up. The guy who would take you in. Now I feel like no one wants to be near me. I am drunk and on drugs just now. Alone. I don't have anyone to talk to. I've thought for the last 2 hours about jumping in my car and fucking off or finding a cliff or bridge. But I know I really don't want to. Just that it might be best. I guess I just want to vent.

"I'm really hoping this is a safe place.  I don't have many other options right now.I used to be a high school teacher, but an affair with a student changed that.  She was of legal age in my state, but this state still has a statute that classifies improper relationships between educators and students as second degree felonies.  The thing is, this wasn't some seedy one-off thing where I pressured her into doing something.  We had grown close over the years she was in school, and eventually (long after she was out of my class) we realized that we were in love with each other.  It was the most painful feeling of my life at that point to realize that I yearned for someone I wasn't supposed to love in that way.  Again, I feel the need to stress that her age was not a factor in this issue.  Had I not been a teacher, or had she not been a student, everything would have been above board.  Hell, if we had waited until right after she graduated, we would have been safe.  That wasn't what happened.  Despite neither of us naturally being risk-takers, we made the decision to have a secret relationship, and we succeeded.  In fact, it actually lasted for a year and a half, through her first semester of college, before word of it somehow got out and the district was forced to investigate.I thought we could beat it, because we had been very careful to cover our tracks, but apparently not careful enough.  Whatever information the investigators claimed they had, they used it to get her to spill everything about our relationship.  As a result, I went to jail.I'm obviously not in jail now, but my future is so uncertain.  I'm not allowed to contact her, because she's considered a ""victim"" by the court, but she could reach out to me if she wanted to.  She hasn't.  As you can probably tell, we're not together anymore, but it feels less like a breakup and more like she died.  After all, people can usually still talk to their exes if they really desire.In jail, there were many times when I thought about killing myself.  After I got out, I still had those feelings.  It's been months now, and I want to think I've gotten better, but those intrusive thoughts still hit me.  I definitely don't want to serve a prison term for something that isn't even illegal in some states, especially when I know I didn't hurt her.  I can't shake the thought that if I do get sentenced to prison rather than probation of some sort, I'll probably kill myself the first chance I get.  If I don't, and if I somehow survive a prison term despite the misconceptions surrounding the charges (I was threatened by other inmates for being a pedophile when the news broke, because people didn't pay attention to the full story), I don't want to live life as a felon.  I know what I did was unethical, but I don't deserve this.  I just want to be happy, and I was with her.  Now I'm empty, broken, and I feel like I have far too much baggage and drama for anyone else to love me the way she did.","1"

The stress of keeping good grades and mental stability at the same time is too much. Ive been having intense mood swings lately and Im either too happy or way too sad to function. I dont know how to keep up with that. And whenever Im not super happy or upset, Im just empty. I left my closest friends recently and now I have nobody at all except for my therapist. And overall, I just feel like a talentless person who will die without making a difference. Ive been depressed for quite a while, but I never thought I could actually commit suicide until recently. I keep having thoughts about what I would put in my suicide note or when Id do it. Im scared of it, but with every day that passes, it feels easier to do. The only thing keeping me alive is an appointment with a psychiatrist in January, but I dont even know if thats enough. Im scared that I might do something stupid one night soon.

"I'm an 18 year old guy, senior in high school, and I'm just tired of life. I very very rarely experience happiness, and if I do it's short lived. I think the last time I was truly happy with my life (somewhat) was 6th grade, my last year of Elementary school. I have decent amount of friends, but I've started to hate the majority of them, well my friend group anyways... I have a few other nice friends outside of that group. I'm sick of being sht-talked, left out and their ""I'm better than you"" attitude towards me. I'm real sick of my parents too. I wouldn't say I'm the typical teen that hates their parents, but I feel like such a failure to them, and they tend favorite my other siblings more. Family gatherings don't feel the same either. I feel awkward and out of place from everyone else. Along with all this, I loathe going to my shitty job and school right after. I have an apprenticeship through my school at factory with really bad pay and a dirty, grimy, dangerous environment. I hate it. And I'm on a contract so I can't quit until High school. Because of this, I have a lighter workload for school, but I can't even find the motivation to do any homework AT ALL.

"I'm depressed and lonely normally, but with the holidays and having no family nearby it always pushes me to the edge on my darkest 'nobody cares about me thoughts.I'm 40, not very attractive and have a borderline Aspie personality and haven't dated anyone in 10 years.The only people I talks with are drinking buddies on a Friday, and they're not the type nor is it the situation that they want to hear me open up about my problems.I feel a loser among most people because my depression makes me feel an underachiever next to them so I either avoid talking about it or just lie to fit in about my status.To be honest I doubt anyone would even care if I died, and I base this on the evidence that no one notices at all if I'm not around for weeks.So should I just do it, because my life will never get better than this?","1"

I had NEVER seen 1% of such laughter anywhere, regardless of its context. I was the only one in the gym.I get that as an physically inferior male I deserve as much pain as possible but instead of laughing next time do something that is mutually beneficial. If you hate me enough to laugh at me then bring a gun and kill me. That way you'll be regaled as a hero for ridding the world of my inferior genes and I will finally stop feeling this pain","1"

And more context on this ""bleed"" is when my emotions (this so called blood) come out from my body it covers me, and after awhile, it dries. But you kno what's left?

"Im so tired of being lonely... I want friends and people to talk with and hang out with, but at the same time a very shy and withdrawn person and get uncomftorable in social circumstances.... This has led me to feel very isolated and unable to relate to other people, but this loneliness, also makes my depression worse.... I have a girlfriend but it's a long distance thing, and she's been able to keep my depression from getting the best of me, but recently her father had woken up in the middle of the night while we were calling and talking to eachother and since that happened she got in trouble for it and now, my already limited time being able to contact and call/message her is in jeopardy and with her being the only person ive had contact with... Im afraid that if our time together messaging and calling stops, and we cant contact eachother anymore that ill be completely alone and forgotten.I've been contemplating why i even bother staying alive... The one person who makes me feel the most alive and makes me depression feel like nothing could end up being not being able to contact anymore.. and if that happens everything bad just rushes back... i dont see why i should live... when all i live is a very lonely lifestyle.. have no friends besides my girlfriend.. dont have a social life.. my family doesnt like me that much... i dont know what to do...","1"

"Why doesnt the thought of losing your relative frighten people? Why are we so tone deaf to how we put ppl down until theyre history? Why is the thought of wanting to die a joke to some people?Why dont we take depressesion seriously until we have to bury someone we know, say goodbye to a famous celebrity, or feel it ourselves. Why did we laugh at Ronda Rousey for saying she wanted to kill herself after the cyber bullying due to that loss. We know damn well if she did, we would be showing fake concern for retweets and likes such as #RIPRonda.Death, self inflicted does not matter to society, because its our fault, according to them. The pain I feel everday, you just feel like walking to a isolated area and giving up. Depression is like a sand castle, builds up as if an invisible force wants you to be frustrated and downright done.Anxiety, anxiety, anxiety. It owns my life like no other. I cant even explain how demon possesed I am with it, it is cripling. My family is struggling, if I die, I can only imagine the downward spiral it can send them. But I cant reach out either.Why would I? So some bitch on the other end of the phone line will contact the cops and send them to my adress? So I can be locked up in some facility? So my school counselor or therapist will contact higher authorities and get my ass busted?!If my family finds out I am LGBT, I am so dead. So I doubt that getting help is what I need. The only option is death, or continue drowning in unrelatable anxiety. ","1"
"They were right. Growing up in abuse, in neglect and poverty really does impact children into adulthood. It's like a viscious cycle. My therapists have all always said they were shocked and amazed that I didn't developed a drug or alcohol problem. That I managed to push through and make something of myself. That I was a good person and a joy to be around. I want to be remembered that way. But I'll just be another statistic.To survive everything I have, to beat the odds and now be facing homelessness in the next week, I can't breathe. All of my friends, all of my support system, it's like they can't seee me. Or they don't want to see me. I'm drowning out in the open and everyone can see me and no one saying or doing anything. Please. Help. I'm not a religious person. Am I being punished for this? Am I wrong? Is this real? I'm drowning under water so shallow others can easily wade in. They see me. I'm so alone but surrounded by everything. I shouldn't have asked but I'm drowning and asking for your hand, but now I'm ashamed I asked. Why did I ask? Because I'm drowning. It's 4 out and I'm going to be homeless. I don't have children so my life doesn't matter. I'm losing everything. I'm a good person. I'm a hard worker. Why? I'm such a fucking good person after all of the awful shitty things that have happened to me in my life, why is this happening? I feel so deeply alone. Just nothing. Everything was fake. A show. Everything I knew was a lie. Everyone was a lie. How will I sleep in the uhaul with them, the dog and the cat? Will my office let me sleep there? Where do I go? It's so cold outside. I just had to empty my head to let everything flow out until there wasn't anything left but the truth.My husband lost his job. The job market is oversaturated with applicants and although he goes to interviews her doesn't hear back despite going to multiple interviews. He has been without work since July. We finally got to where we could no longer afford our rent this month on my and the roommates income alone, I got sick, and we're now being evicted. Court is Wednesday. We asked our parents for money as did our roommate, but no one can help. We won't come up with enough money to pay off our rent this month or for a deposit and first month rent on a cheaper place before the court date. I'm terrified the judge won't give us any more time. None of our friends have offered us any help or even a place for Thanksgiving dinner. I am afraid we will be homeless come Wednesday night. I live in Alaska. It's 3 outside right now. I have a good job, my roommate has an okay job, why the fuck is this happening to me? I'm not sure if we can sleep in a uhaul with three people a dog and a cat...I don't have a support system. I've ruined my work life by asking a co-worker for money to help me. I feel like I have to quit and I can't go back there. That was inappropriate. I'm just panicking and reaching out for help.I feel like I'm having a breakdown. I don't know what to do. If I disappeared they would go their separate ways without me with their respective parents. I can't show my face again at work. Not after what I asked. I've ruined the relationship. It will be forever awkward. I'm not going to have enough money either way to pay my rent or move into a less expensive place. I'm losing my housing and won't be able to keep up my job after that. It's so isolating to feel like you had so many friends and family members but no one will help me. I'm a good person and would give anything to my friends in need, a seat at my table, shirt off of my back or a place to sleep. No one has offered me a anything. I'm so alone it's deafening. I'm so afraid. I've never been so afraid in my life. I've never been so deeply depressed. Through neglect and abuse, and this is what happens to good people. We're all brutally alone. I'm so scared.","1"
"I want to die. To fall asleep and never wake up. To fall headlong into the abyss of my dreams where there is no one for me to hurt and no one to hurt me. I want a fortune teller to drop her crystal ball and cry for the tragedy of a young death and turn to hold her children close before they turn to dust in her arms. I want to apologize  for what I've done and be apologized to for what's been done to me. I want to feel the love of my parents just once. I want to stop the bleeding but all that I have is broken glass and memories of bandaids with smiling little stickers. In the end I can choose to die or not die but I'm tired of being hurt by my own mind and I'm tired of watching myself ruin my life and I'm tired of seeing myself drive my friends away and I'm tired of not being ready for death. Every morning it's a struggle to get out of bed and every afternoon it's a struggle to eat and every night it's a struggle to hurt myself and every second it's a struggle to stop breathing in and only breathe out. For 3 years. It's not a long time but it's enough time. Every moment of those 3 years has culminated into a grand total of nothing, with this spiteful mind of mine fighting tooth and nail with this selfless mind of mine and now both of them are just battered to hell and so fucking tired. Why push a boulder up a mountain when the chasm eating at my heels is calling me by name? Is this a suicide note? I might never know.","1"
"I guess some background, I am a 22 year old male--currently in nursing school.  Please excuse these ramblings.  I know there isn't a lot of form to it.  Worked 12 hours today, tired, and currently drinking.I guess I have been feeling kinda shitty for the last couple of months.  Thoughts of suicide have been becoming more frequent, and I can't get them out of my head.  It started out thinking about what death is really like, realizing it isn't that bad, realizing I would be ok with dying, being apathetic towards being alive, and now not really wanting to live. A friend of mine committed suicide in early November.  This was the only time it seemed to get better.  For about a week I had no thoughts of suicide as I was grieving.  Then I had a thought.  ""It's selfish for me to want him back.  For him to live in suffering for my benefit?  Of what?  Just for the sake he's still alive?  And if that is true, can I really blame him for what he did?  Can anyone really blame anyone for making the ultimate decision of human autonomy and taking their own life?""I have a good life.  Finances are ok.  I am in a 5 year relationship.  I plan on proposing soon.  When thinking about suicide, there is one huge criteria I think one has to meet to commit a reasonably justified suicide.  You can't have anybody that directly relies on you.  So essentially kids.  I feel as if my time is running out to control my life.  Once I have kids (which may be awhile, or at least I plan on it being awhile), I no longer have the option of committing suicide.  I just want someone to talk to.  For whatever reason, the closer someone is to me the more difficult it becomes.  Although I love her dearly, I think my significant other would either think I am lying, over exaggerating,  or trying to get attention--which is the absolute last thing I want--from anyone.  Shit.  When my buddy committed suicide earlier this month I felt like I couldn't even show any emotions because it would somehow take away from his death, or inadvertently have people feel sorry for me.   I have thought about talking to a close coworker of mine, but I don't know how to even bring it up.  My aunt whom I love dearly has stressed to come and talk to her about that sort of thing and how she would never want me to do ""something like that"", but it just seems too taboo to bring it up.  The person I have been surprisingly the most comfortable talking to has been one of my nursing school professors.  She is so non judgemental and understanding.  She pulled me aside one day and just out of the blue asked how I was doing with my friend, that she has been meaning to call me into her office, and if I ever need to talk, feel free to stop by her office.  After about 30 minutes of debating to myself, I did.  We talked about my friend.   But there is something deep down I couldn't tell her.  I think his death bothers me not just because I lost a friend, but it was someone who I never would have thought of committing suicide.  It gives it a sort of legitimacy.  All of a sudden what I was thinking about had a real concrete example.  She gave me the number of the counseling center, but I have to drive 60 miles to get to it since I am not based on my school's main campus.  Because she is so comforting and understanding, I want to just go in and tell my professor I have frequent thoughts of suicide--but am really afraid of the consequences.  Will I be brought to a psych ward?  Will others find out?  Will I be deemed 'Psychologically unstable"", and can't go to clinicals?Before leaving her office she said she was going to file a BIT report, (Behavior Intervention Team) but from my last college we used them exclusively for high risk students.  So I think she has an idea anyway, but I don't know.  That was nearly two weeks ago--and I haven't heard anything else.What I am saying is, I don't know who or how to talk to anyone, I don't know if I want to kill myself, I just would rather not be alive I guess.  I am afraid of the consequences of talking to someone.  I thought all this would subside after a week or two but it just has gotten worse and worse.Thanks for those who stuck around.","1"

So I go and get there coffee and tea and I come back and they said it was late despite the fact that they were second in the queue! They began to shout at me and degrade me and they both said that I should kill myself! What a thing to say an already depressed person, cunts!

"I don't believe in God. If I kill myself, I believe one of two things will happeneternal nothingness, or reincarnation. If I fade away after I die and just become nothing, I won't care. If I become a new person, gain a new body, I can have the chance to start back over. Suicide seems, to me, to be a faulty reset button.I can't find it in myself to care how other people will feelor rather, I want this more than I don't want to hurt the two people who might actually care. I somewhat hope that finding my body will make some people in my family realize that I _was_ here, that what I've gone through _isn't_ a joke. I hate that they were angry and dismissive when I failed last time, and right now I want them to hurt.There's one person who this will have a lasting effect on, I think. Everyone else might cry and say they wish they'd known or done something, but I can't imagine they'll think of me or miss me at all after the funeral.What I have planned will kill me in a matter of minutes, so I can be gone by the time anyone realizes.The next time I'm alone, I'm going to make a video explaining things, then it'll be over.Because even the people who care can't even begin to imagine this. My life is the worst I can imagine, it's a living hell right now. They don't understand that I mean it when I say anything would be betterI'd rather be born sane and ""normal"" into an abusive family, I'd rather be born and starve to death at some point during childhood, I'd rather be born and have a disability or chronic illness that means something (because apparently if you aren't permanently hospitalized you're just trying to get attention). __Anything__ would be better.If I kill myself, there's an approximate 50% chance, in my view, that I'll cease existing and not care anymore, and not hurt anymore. And an approximate 50% chance of being able to do better, or live a better life.""Restarting"" in this life isn't possible anymore. All that would do is delay the tiny, infinitesimal hope that there is for some point in my future, and seeing as it's already not enough for me to want to keep living, it'd just be a waste of my time.""If you're going to kill yourself anyway, live the way you want to first."" It's just not possible. There is nothing I can do in my own power that would let me live as myself for even a second. If I want to ""be myself"", I have to wait 20+ years. I might never get there. It's just not worth it anymore.I suppose I could joke that I was born into ""nightmare difficulty"". I'm aware that the problem is my mind. It doesn't change the fact that I can't deal with this anymore.I remember stuff in my past that apparently never happened (schizophrenic, and I guess anyone could deny having done something and I'd have to take their word for it because of that). As long as there's no evidence, it's the word of a crazy against theirs, so what are people going to believe?Given how much people say I'm hurting them for wanting to be who I am, I guess it'll be a relief. I wonder if they'll share it at or before my funeral; I wonder if they'll deny my identity even after I'm dead. I'm just ready to be gone.","1"

"I have the worst luck in the world and everything I have done in life is a joke. I have always suffered from depression and out of high school when going to college I didnt have the self esteem or drive to do well Im school. I graduated with a degree that is not worth much and got a 2.8 GPA. I had a hard time finding a job after college and enlisted in the military when I was 26.For the first time in my life I felt ok, I had purpose and drive. I did well and I liked my job. My first assignment was amazing. I started working a masters degree and finished with a 3.95 GPA. But the next assignment I found myself over my head and realised Im not smart enough to do the job. This caught up to me.  After 4 years I was deployed. I had some strange things happen in which I started to lose touch with reality. It alarmed my leadership and had to go to mental health. I ended up getting diagnosed with schizophrenia! Now Im not allowed to continue service. When I returned home I got so depressed about this, I started drinking a lot and ended up getting arrested one night for trespassing (went to the same bar not realising it after being told to leave). Now I only have a month left in the military and once Im out Im screwed.There is so much competition for jobs these days, having this arrest on my record will screw me, I also lost my clearance so I cant do the job Ive been doing for nearly the last decade. My masters degree was from a for profit school and no employer will take it seriously. I only got it because I was guided by leadership telling me it was a good school and I believed them.So here I am 35, about to lose my career and have no hope of starting a new one. Not only this but I have no friends, no gf, no reason to try anymore. I have a horrible personality, Im quiet, Im not that smart and now I have this medical condition and a criminal record. Now its a very unserious crime, but given the nature of the job market today, it will make me not to be considered by employers. I feel lost, hopeless and like everything I have done has been for nothing, I have worked SO hard and its worth nothing now. My life is a joke and its difficult to conjure up the will to continue on. Im getting uglier each day and feel like I have no purpose. I dont know what to do or how I will overcome this. Ive had thought of ending it as I see no future in my life. Im a screw up and a failure. I dont understand why god let me come so far to only let me fail and block any ability for me to recover. I have no hope. ","1"

"It all starts with 4 years old me getting bullied until I was maybe 8 or  9 it completely broke my heart since I had no friends growing up but it effected me in a much deeper way completely destroyed my self esteem I've been always hiding my identity,my face,my body from everyone the last 5 years I've been hiding in my room even if I can't really do that.I've passed all my teenage years online doing nothing but killing time.The major problem is that after that whole depressing phase this year started great with new friends I started being really interested in my school lessons until mid October when I completely stopped doing everything and felt a void inside me.And here I am now I was wishing for a fresh start trying to build everything again from scratch and here comes the person who insulted me telling me I'm ugly and fat while in class I felt completely ruined I tried starting laughing but it didnt work it just turned into an unimpressed face that moment I immediately  thought of running outside and jumping off the balcony. The person who was sitting next to me almost died from laughter and was staring at me waiting for me to cry,I did not .I continued my school time as if nothing happened and then came home to crying for maybe 8 hours straight.I wished with all my heart for him to actually get involved in a car crash and die since he destroyed my self esteem for maybe forever.I had a similar circumstance with that same guy when I was 11 or 12 which hurt a bit but then I realized that we were just kids and didnt know...But what about now when we are fully grown up?And we are supposed to actually think before speak.I'm seriously thinking of committing suicide since I have nothing to give on this earth,Ive always been a disappointment for my parents and someone to hide for my friends.I have nothing to live for.I thought of actually killing the people that hurt me and then committing suicide.I'm a miserable piece of shit and I do not deserve living in this planet.

"Hello. I've had depression and suicidal ideation for years now. I was diagnosed with depression at a young age and have had suicidal thoughts daily since I was around 9 or 10. Depression seems to just be something I will always live with; I don't remember a time it wasn't there. I would have gone through with my death years ago but those I love is what keeps stopping me along with the future. Up until this year, anyway. I met my goal of getting to college. I always meet my goals, even if it kills me; I lost over 50% of my hair my senior year of HS due to stress because I wanted to get an honors diploma last minute along with some very hard classes and taking care of my grandmother.Now the future is uncertain and I don't entirely want to be here to bear witness to it.To me, life only has purpose if you give it purpose; what that purpose is is at one's discretion. I don't see it.Suicide has always been a comfort to me. Why does everyone fear death? I don't see many asking that. The default response is always, ""don't do that, it's bad!""... but why? There's many on this earth and I would only be missed for so long by the majority of people who know about me if at all. In the grand scheme of things, I don't really matter. And to me that's freeing. I just want to go. I'm tired of the fight. I feel like I'm only living for others even as I'm getting a near-full ride to uni for my own sake.","1"
"I'm sixteen, no friends, never talk to anybody, rarely leave the house and am years behind in school. Suicide honestly seems more merciful than anything at this point. I have been depressed and anxious my whole life and suffered from dissociative disorders ever since I was little. I just want to know the least painful way to do it that will actually work. Please help me. I just want this misery to end.","1"
"I'm going to preface everything by saying that suicidal thoughts have been going through my brain for over half of my life. It's something that I've always dealt with and inevitably goes away, but it's been lingering for almost 6 months now and I'm getting tired of it. So here's my story. Earlier this year I fucked up horribly bad. I broke into my parents house after being kicked out, and completely trashed the place out of frustration. Afterwards, my life completely shit spiralled. I lost my girlfriend, my closest friends, my family support, and became homeless at the age of 20. It took a few months before I could use social services and figure out a place to stay and find work, and have slowly been trying to figure out how to repair the emotional scar left on my parents and family. I'm still dealing with what I did to their house in court 8 months later, but it's all too much. Everything is too much. Losing the girl I wanted to marry, losing friends I thought would be around forever, and having my family look at me like an alien has been too much. In July I was diagnosed by a psychiatrist with major depressive disorder and general anxiety issues, and have been taking 6x the starting dosage of an antidepressant with another one to help me sleep. Nothing seems to help. I've decided that I'm going to apply for a hunting license so I can get a gun and shoot myself.","1"

"I feel super isolated and it's steering back into my suicidal pit.None of my friends have responded to texts in 3-4 days.  I'm totally alone and if I killed myself I honestly don't think anybody would notice.  Usually when I get this low (as in researching methods of suicide) I force myself to go do something (like running), but I just feel so drained and empty.  Called my local suicide line, but I was on hold for 20 minutes before I hung up.I really just want a hug.  Not to be melodramatic, but I really can't remember the last time someone hugged me.  Or touched me non-accidentally.I can't stop thinking about an ad I saw for Big 5 - shotguns for $250.","1"
"I have decent grades, my SAT score is a 1520, I've been in student council the last four years, there are friends who invite me to hangout and my parents love me. But despite this there are these issues that I know are nothing compared to what other people deal with that makes me miserable.None of my friends actually care about me. The ones that do I always push away. There's a poison within me that pushes away everyone who gets close to me, it a quirk I have. I've never experienced love, I've never felt a girl with love. There's no one I can sit down with and tell my problems to that I know will truly listen to me and care about me.I'm built to lie. I lie about all sorts of things. I lie that I had my first kiss. I lie that I earn 1000$ a week from gambling. I lie about stupid things to make myself feel better about myself. I don't know why. It's like a papercut to myself everytime I do so but I keep doing it.My parents buy me so many things despite money being scarce because of my expensive ass education. Yet, it's not enough for me. I want the newest designer shoes or the newest game console. Why can't I be grateful for what I have? Why am I not grateful for what I have? I should be. I hate myself for this so FUCKING much. Sometimes I even steal money. I haven't been caught and I've stolen over 15,000$. It stresses me I can't get everything I want so I resort to this. I need help and I should stop but I can't.I have a mental issue that I don't know how I will fix. Sometimes I just want to attack people. Sometimes I do, I haven't faced legal consequences because of this. I hate when I do this and I want to stop but my fucked up head makes me lose control sometimes.I'm scared. Soon I'll leave Asia and I'll head to a university in America. I want to live my life happy but there is just so many issues that shouldn't be issues. I should just be grateful for the wealth I have. I should stop pushing friends away. I should seek mental help. But I just can't I know how pathetic I sound. BUT I FUCKING Can't. I don't know what to do. Please help me. Please.Sometimes I even feel like I was born as a villain. That there is no path for me in life than to be the bad guy. Sometimes I feel like if I die, the world will be a better place considering all these shitty things I do. I don't know what to do.","1"

"Hi there. Ill try to keep this succinct and fact based. Im in my late 20s and have been battling depression since middle school. I made the first of two attempts at taking my own life when I was in college but none since then. Im doing well at work, but I couldnt care less. Im just a corporate husk thats good at what they tell me to do. I think I used to find it fulfilling, but Im realizing how much navet I had in thinking there was something more at work than just positioning and politics. I think at one point I had a vision for what myself or my company could do. That all just seems so silly now. I havent been in a relationship or had any kind of meaningful date or interaction in a decade. Im not socially incapable or awkward. Intimacy isnt something i experience anywhere or in any fashion. Ive done the whole online dating thing and had a few convos and went on a few first dates. Nothing bad, nothing good. Just a wave that calmly crashes and unremarkably rotates back into the sea. I think I have friendships. People that needed something from me or got something out of interacting with me, I guess. I think I should have held people more accountable for my needs or feelings. Or something. Im on enough meds to turn Elliot smith into Jimmy Buffett, but idk. Sometimes it feels like its making a difference. Its just been so long without a real change. Im an only child too, if that helps the armchair psychologists out there.I never really felt good about my family. I think abuse I had as a child made it so Im always trying to impress authority figures as a surrogate for love I never got as a child. But this is nothing new. I shook a drinking problem almost two years ago and havent drank since. Each day gets harder and not easier. The consequences of my alcoholic life seem so far away, and the rewards so near. Ill stay the course for appearances sake. But its not something Im particularly proud of or care for. Oddly enough, I got some very negative health news, my pancreas isnt working again, which is functionally turning me into a type 1 diabetic. But this seems like a footnote in the grand scheme of things. And the gap in taking my own life has been the courage to do so. Maybe this is a way out? Idk. Theres other tidbits and news I can reference here, but Id prefer not to identify myself and theyre all just flavors of the same straw thats breaking this camels back. But I digress. Its weird. Ive lurked here for over five years. Idk, something about these notes or cries for help gave me some sense of perverse comfort in knowing that Im not alone.... or something? But idk I just feel nothing now. Suicide was always this thing I was in the throes of, this big emotional fuck you to the rest of the world. But now it seems so simple, so easy, so obvious. Just this natural conclusion. Ive had my fill of whatever this is and would like the check, please. Its now a comforting place for me to go and honestly makes be weirdly a bit serene.  So idk. Not tonight, but I suppose soon. I want time to think of how to do it. Perhaps Ill at least wait until my parents are gone. As Im sure with many, the only thing keeping me from offing myself is how much it might hurt my parents. Whether they deserve that kindness or not... I have no idea. Thanks for reading. And if you are suicidial I hope you can get some help and make some different decisions than Ive made. Yours,GobbleDibbles ","1"

"I'm ready to die. Sooner or later this gun will be used. I'm done, just done. No more. Better off dying sooner than later. I keep listening to this Radiohead cd on a loop ""i'm better off dead"", ""i'm better off dead"". I really fucking am. Everynight, sometimes when I do actually cry I don't - I actually bleed myself to sleep with a razor. The only thing that keeps me up, anyway, but I don't want to be up. I wish I never opened my eyes on that day of August 8th, 1999. Why was I born? I didn't ask to be, I don't want to be, and I wish I never was. Your idiot god apparently thought it was a good idea, though. He also thought it was funny when back in 2008 I walked in on my mom dead on the bathtub overdosed on herion and when my dad shot himself right in front of me in 2010. After a year so far in the group home In 2012 I got mollested. In 2013 I got raped. 2014, I overdosed on ibuprofen once trying to end my life, again in 2015 when I tried to hang myself but got caught in the school basement. Got expelled over that, got arrested for stabbing a bully in the stomach at the group home, spent a year in juvy where I got jumped and most of my teeth knocked out. Here I am, got out last month when i was 18 and I can't eat, can't sleep, pattially blind and can barely see, I lay behind the streets and have mice and bugs eating what little clothes I have. I still love going to the library, here right now. I don't talk to anybody though. I really don't have any hobbies besides reading nor any talents nor a real reason to live. I walk around downtown in the cold and look around and see a dark depressing world I just don't want to live in. I mean it when I say I'm going to kill myself. I'm better off dead.","1"
"I had to write that title to confirm it. Im going to use a rope and attach it to a wooden plank going across the top of my garage, and Im going to use a chair to finish the job. I havent decided which chair yet. There is no way that can fail. I wont be able to breathe. No one will check on me for a good hour or so. What changed? I dont really know. I just kind of realised that Im well and truly finished on the 25th of November. I wish I had a cooler date but maybe this is the one god had in mind for me. Id rather die then go back to day to day life as of now.Ive just been listening to Lone by Tyler The Creator. That will be the last song I ever hear most probably. Ill listen to music for about an hour beforehand.If anyone wants to know a bit more about me, Im 16, male, in college. Never had a girlfriend. I couldve, but I didnt due to anxiety. Part of me wonders if it couldve been different if I was born quite good looking, and I had a girlfriend. You know, that emotional and affectionate kinda relationship with a best friend that you care about. Im going to die a virgin but I dont think I care. Ever since I got acne my self esteem plummeted, and I cant shake it off. I dont want to say acne killed me, but I think its finishing me off.Im passionate about football, well I was, but Ive gotten too depressed to even look at a football. I dont even care to watch it anymore. Nothing interests me. I only go to the gym so no one thinks there is anything wrong with me. Ive been seeing a doctor but therapy is too long of a wait. Haha, I hope they dont show my school photo in memorial to me. I fuckin hate that picture. I shit you not, Im just going to put in my suicide note a personal message to my college to explicitly NOT put my picture on the big screen. Im evidently insecure in the afterlife My family. I dont want to talk about them. I love them too much and I hate the fact that Im about to put them through pain but its temporary. Its all temporary.I am a popular kid at my school. Thats not me saying Im this great cool guy at the top of the hierarchy, but theres not a single person in that college who I hate and couldnt be their friend. How do I think theyll react? I dont know. How do you react? Cry? Maybe for a day or two. Then theyll be fine, right? Funnily enough, I spent my last day ill, doing nothing, just chilling. I watched a few funny videos, I think Im going to go on Xbox later and try fortnight battle royale as people tell me its really good. Plus its free.Why am I making this post? A final message to Reddit after 2 years or so. And more importantly, I want to know if any of you, have lost anyone to suicide. I want to know how people reacted afterwards. I want to know whether everyone will be okay without me. If its attention seeking then Im sorry for that. But I dont want to leave having said nothing at all, you know? I used to read these posts and make comments all the time about a year ago. Never in my life did I think Id be on the other side.I think thats everything. Thats all of my concerns. No more schoolwork, no more stress about the future, no more pessimism, no one judging me, no more judging myself. Im going to go have dinner. Play some Xbox. Grab my headphones and phone, turn on my playlist, and hang myself. In 3 hours, my story will be over. Crazy. ","1"
"Hi, I'm depressed as all hell. Have been since 5 years old. I have an abundance of disorders and problems. I HATE my body/face EVERYTHING about myself. I hate waking up every morning, my days are blurring together. I hate looking in the mirror. I hardly have the want / desire to shower or even brush my teeth. I'm bored out of my mind but refuse to leave my bed/home. I want to feel happy, for myself for my fiance.. family etc.. I want to be beautiful, I want to feel beautiful but I'm fat with a not so cute face and small boobs. (Average i guess.) I hate my legs and my tummy i hate my eye color even though everyone ""loves"" it. This list of ""I hates "" would literally go on for ever but eh. I want to off myself so everyone around me can feel and be happy. I want to off myself so my fiance can find someone prettier, Skinner, more mature. I want to off myself so i dont have to look at myself in the mirror anymore.ice been having extreme thoughts of self harm, but have kept myself from crossing that line as i am a few months clean now.  But i look at my fiances belt, or something even slightly resembling a noose and my thoughts are on that for hours. If i get in a fight with him, or family my brain automatically goes to suicide as a way for me to retreat ""well they dont want me. Listen to how theyre talking to me."" Not only that im a bitch, i can be mean.. and i cant control it. This makes me feel 100000000x worse even if its in self defense or because I'm being ignored. I wkll feel horrible for it. I'm tired of being fucking walked on.. I'm tired of being looked down on and treated like fucking shit by everyone that pretends to care. I fucking hate myself.I'm over it.","1"

No amount of politically correct Jedi mind trickery or Marxian moralizing could negate this reality.I just can't stop thinking about suicide these past few months. Every. Fucking. Day. Sometimes it's an all day thing. It starts when i wake up usually. My brain actually hurts sometimes due to the sheer self-hatred. I hate how i keep using the word ""sometimes"" in this post. I'm 32 and my 23 year old half brother has me beat in life accomplishments by light years. Any normal person would. Why couldn't i be born normal? Anyway. I know it's not going to get any better, due to being biologically inferior. I hate myself more than antifa hate Trump, or Jews hate Hitler. I can't look in the mirror. I can't even make a fucking good reddit suicide post. And it's not just self pity. It is objective reality. I'm sitting here with my fathers side of the family and it compounds my suicidal urges, seeing normal happy people enjoying themselves. I'm not jealous, except maybe of my half brother, it's more like being a self-aware roach on the wall of a museum full of beautiful art, or restaurant full of delicious smelling food. Should i go to the hospital for this? I can't take the pain any more and need a short term fix. Are there any wars i can go to and fight in so that i might go out in a blaze of glory?","1"

All I ever wanted was to look after others and find someone who cares for me, But that's not happening and it's the cold hard truth, Even last time I posted on here all I ever get is generic responses - No one actually gives a fucking damn about anyone else only themselves, Why is life so goddamn unfair I fucking hate everything right now","1"

"So reddit, boyfriend broke up with me couple of hours ago. He said he just didn't care about our relationship anymore, and my presence and our time together wasn't making him happy like it used to.During the last month we haven't spent as much time as we used to since I have been studying very hard (I am in med school) and I was hoping to catch up with my studies to have more time for hanging out in the following weeks-we still went out 3 to 4 times per week. The thing is, we used to spend every day together before, had sleepovers often etc.We already went through a breakup once, but that was under different circumstances, due to some things that happened and there were fights and anger involved from both sides. But that time I knew that when everything calmed down, he would eventually understand and at some point we would get back together, and that's how it was. The situation is different this time, since there were no fights involved and nothing abnormal happened, There are certain reasons though, why I find his decision very difficult to explain to myself.1. Just 2 months ago, my boyfriend got very drunk and in those situations he becomes really talkative, honest and open. He said at that time how I meant everything to him, how I am the best person he knows and how he loves me very much.2. He got in a fight with his parents due to reasons I found very irational so he moved in his grandma's place. His behaviour changed a bit after that. We had some arguments over his decision and relationship with his parents, but nothing big or serious.3. I complained to him this week how I was afraid of him drifting further away from me since I was busy with studying  last month and how I wanted him to know that I really missed hanging out with him and was really hyped for us spending some longer time together today and in future. He sent me a message where he said how he's happy I'm a part of his life and how he really cares about us (when I mentioned this to him today he just said that that was how he felt few days ago but not anymore-wtf?)4. So when we met today we went out to play some board games but I noticed how bored he looked like and he complained how he was tired so we left earlier and got to his place where I mentioned how I was kinda sad that he wasn't as hype as I was since we haven't seen each other for so long and that it was making me nervous (I have some anxiety issues). He wasn't giving me satisfying answers, and I kinda started freaking out. He asked me to come to bed where he was lying, hugged me in a way that was supposed to be comforting  but I just didn't feel he was doing it from the heart. He started saying some weird things then, like how I was gonna be okay and stuff like that and that was enough for me to get the hint. I got my stuff, waited a bit to calm myself since I started crying and went out where I waited for my friend to pick me up. All the time while I was crying, my boyfriend was just lying in bed and was on his phone.I just don't know what to do. I don't have many friends, and I love my boyfriend dearly, he is the first and only person I ever felt 100% comfortable with, the first person I got in love with and he accepted me for who I am and I really felt adored. I went through a breakup once before with him as I said and those were the worst months of my life where I felt like an empty shell of a human-I managed to operate ob auto-pilot and even do great in school and at the gym, but that's what it was, like I turned on auto-pilot mode and I thkught abkut him every single day. I really think I won't be able to love like that again, and to open up to someone. I know I am not capable of going through this again especially now that I have a strong feeling this is the last time of us talking. I just want not to feel and make everything go away, nothing seems to matter anymore, I am really scared for the coming days.TL;DR Boyfriend of 3 years broke up with me today due to undefined reasons, I think I can't go through a breakup for the second time.

I never wanted anything like this to happen, I dont know what I did wrong to deserve this I just feel myself tearing away from this shell..more than half the time I just think about how everything couldve been avoided had I never have been born or that I just died, everything would just be easier for everyone around me. No one would have to stress out, yell, or leave. Ive always hated that part. I really just dont know anymore, I feel like just ending it. I honestly dont even feel like Im the same person I was 6 months ago. I feel like a complete stranger in my own skin. I just feel so uncomfortable here.","1"

"I want to make this sound as least selfish as possible, but it may be difficult. I recently turned 14 and everything is getting incredibly overwhelming.To start things off, from the age of seven I was abused physically, emotionally and verbally. I now have a protection order against him for roughly three years. From the age of 11 I have always considered suicide. Its a thought that has just hug around, I never go a day without thinking of it. Theres a barrier in front of me. Like yeah, I can be happy I guess, but theres always a wall just in front of me that stops me from getting to complete happiness, to deal with that, I usually blast music until it vibrates through my entire body, it is so deafening it kind of gives a release. I also cut severely, my arm is beaten up but I am not satisfied. I have a goal for how many scars i want and I do it because I want to see my body be destroyed at times where I dont want to die. My best friend Zara commuted Suicide in 2016, and my other close friend Raechel on September 8th 2017. I think about Raechel every day, Zara is in the back of my mind but not as much. Its comforting knowing that when I die I will see them. I know that they are in heaven, I am a Christian, and I am pretty sure I will go to heaven (I have done much research on this). But anyways, I have been to mental hospital 6 times, and Im just fucked up. Im always so tired, I never want to get out of bed, I am diagnosed with clinical depression. I just want something to live for, I litterwlly have nothing.Yes, I have friends, I am so grateful to have incredible friends who are there for me and I know that, but I still feel so lonely. I know there are people going through the exact same thing but still. I have even considered having a child just to give myself a reason to be alive, and Im seriously considering it now. But I know its unfair to bring a child into this world when I honestly would have no idea what I would be doing. I know that this will pass but waiting for it to pass is too long, Id rather give up no.I take setraline for my depression and add, thank you for listening. I just need advice. Thanks:/","1"

I ponder on existence and think that I am a worthless, insignificant asshole who only cause pain. I also went to a private mental hospital but all it did was make the situation worse.

"I am here mainly to vent. So basically, about 2ish years ago My mom died and caused me to go into a depression. It got harder and harder until I snapped and tried hanging myself a few months back. I tried again a week later. I then told my dad about my depression a few months ago. I got thrown into an immanuel twice and am on a good amount of meds atm and am seeing a therapist, but nothing is working. Every day I feel as if I lose more and more interest of my life. There just isnt a point to life for me. May try hanging myself again soon, but got this far because of the overwhelming amount of love and support my family has given me. I just really want to get better, but I feel as if nothing will. All i do is go to school play video games smoke weed and go to work. Life is so fucking repetitive, and I have no motivation at all to continue. I mean, I really dont want to hurt my family, but Im getting really close to my snapping point again","1"
"Been around 10 months since I vented here on this throwaway and my life has actually changed a bit. I have some friends who I'm quite close to and I go out a lot with them, but I don't feel like I could ever actually open up to them, even if they do open up to me about personal problems. The other day one of my housemates described me as someone who doesn't really get upset by anything and I really wanted to correct him but I don't want anyone to worry about me.I feel like things are just constantly either getting worse or just not changing at all, sure I have a few people I could consider close friends but I still feel as if I barely ever feel anything and I'm pretty sure this shows through my actions quite a lot, I wish I could give specific examples but I'm really paranoid of anyone ever finding my posts.I've fucked up again and self harmed for the first time since the very beginning of this year, I honestly have no idea where I'm going with this post and I have an inkling it'll get removed for how overwhelmingly negative it is but I honestly think it's just inevitable that I'll die by suicide, there is no other way. Everyone says things get better but I honestly don't think it can for me, maybe it can for other people who aren't giant fuck ups but I think I'm just a fundamentally broken person and the only reason I haven't killed myself already is because my family seems to be dropping like flies and I don't want to put the burden of yet another funeral cost on their shoulders.","1"

The girl I've liked for over a year dislikes me, I'm a very ugly, stupid, bland, socially inept and generally very bad or uninteresting person, not to mention my horrendous voice.Worst of all, I'm in agonizing pain every moment of my life. I have not known what it's like to be pain free for years, and worst of all, since it hurts more to move, I can no longer do any activities that make me happy. Of course, I can sit down in a chair all day and waste my life and school and the internet/video games, but I get no entertainment from that. The treatment that barely dulls the pain, and it costs thousands per month. I live in the U.S. but am a Canadian citizen, so I cannot get a job to support my family with the payments.

"Hey. 25 male here. Since the beginning of the month I've now lost 27lbs unintentionally and every day is roughly 70% stomach pain. I've had fits of throwing up blood and the doctors have no clue what's wrong. It's 12:40 AM right now and I'm still in pain. For the first time in my life I just want to give up. Life like this just isn't worth it. I went from being fit to fragile in less than a month and nothing I do makes me feel any better.The doctors gave me a follow-up date of February 14, and I'll be honest. If I'm in pain like this every day day, there's no way I'm letting myself live that long. I'm going to make it through the holidays to see my family, but that's all I have left to look forward to. Today my brother told me to stop being a pussy about it, and I know he didn't mean any harm... But I've been faking optimism from day 1 and can't do that anymore.

"I've been depressed and suicidal for several years now, and I figure life is only going to get more difficult as time goes on. I recently turned 20 years old, and I spent my entire birthday either crying or sleeping, just because I was so disgusted at myself for being alive this long and not having killed myself yet.I've been in several therapy programs and tried countless medications, and they seem to help a little bit, but the problems are still here. Because I figure that life is only going to get harder as I get older, the only way for me to truly be happy is by being dead. I believe that once I die my consciousness will cease to exist, and that is exactly what I want. So I feel that by undergoing all this work to heal myself, I'm only making things worse by bringing my thoughts further away from suicide. I often even try to sabotage myself by doing various things that I know are emotionally unhealthy, all in hope that maybe it will make me miserable enough to have the will to kill myself. but it hasn't worked so far.I don't know what to do with myself. I am pretty sure what the ""right"" answer would be in this situation, but part of me feels that by trying to emotionall/mentally heal myself, I'm ultimately only going to make myself more unhappy by prolonging my life. I feel like a coward for not having killed myself even after contemplating it for 6 years. I'm actually not sure what I hope to gain from making this post, as I suspect I know what kind of responses I'll get, if any. I'm always getting the ""it gets better"" talk but as much as the words seem to make sense, I I honestly don't believe it.I guess I'm just saying that I feel that me ""getting better"" would only make things worse. there's a part of me that wants to want to get better, but there's also a part of me that would rather be dead than be ""better"". I've been trying so hard for a long time now, and I'm just getting so tired. ","1"
"I dont know where to start with this because there is so much that has stayed inside me for years but I feel like I need to finally let it out.  So here it goes for those that read.Depression has run through my moms side of the family. I have an aunt and cousin who are diagnosed with it currently. When I was around sophomore year of high school my life started to change. I remember how I wanted to get accepted into the naval academy and from there go into the navy as a commissioned pilot. I struggled in school to get good grades and I slowly saw my dream slipping away from me.  These events led to me feeling depressed in which one day my mom found me in my closet with a knife crying. After this I went to start seeing a counselor for about a year and a half before he let me go and said I suffered from a form of schizophrenia(I dont remember what exactly).  I began taking medication, feeling better and realizing I could still be a navy pilot it would just require a ton of effort.Flash forward to senior year of high school.  I was hanging out with friends all the time enjoying life. I started to smoke pot but quickly grew away from it because I didnt want it to interfere with school.  Christmas break comes along and my group of friends wanted to have a secret Santa/party with us all.  Somewhere in the midst of things I had told my friends it was on my bucket list to try cocaine in my life. They said if we get it for the party will you try it and I said yeah. They ended up getting the cocaine and bringing it to the party and I tried it. While on cocaine some of the friends within the group were girls and I dont know why but some of them were in a room and I was walking by and overheard them say who would ever date AmazingRob, he is so ugly. As soon as I heard I ran out of the house and sat outside. I was shocked. I had a few girlfriends before myself and just couldnt fathom what was said. To this day I have never told anyone about this and it crushes me deep down inside.I began college and was enrolled in the Air Force rotc program. Our first day we had to fill out a bunch of paperwork and one of the topics was about our drug use. I hate myself sooo much for this but I put down I had tried cocaine and smoked some weed early my senior year of high school. Two weeks later I was called in my the colonel and told I was dismissed from the program and no waiver could save me but he had tried. I was so mad at myself that semester and got put on academic probation. I truly was depressed and lied to my friends, while developing an alcohol Addiction. I had sex for my first time after this and shortly after I began hanging out with this girl that I started catching feelings for. At this point I began to feel good about myself and that those girls were dumb/ignorant for saying that stuff to me. It got to the point with this girl that I was going to ask her to be my girlfriend when she suddenly dropped theres another guy and I dont want you anymore. This troubled me but I got over it. She texted me later that summer asking to talk cause she missed me. I found out she had been doing cocaine with her soccer coach so I didnt want to take anything to heart but you know how that goes. She told me that while I had a great personality she did not always find me attractive. She said she wanted to start talking again but at point I was pissed at her and blew her off. I forgot to add I had a cocaine addiction that started freshman year where I dont know where I was going in life just moving with a flow. I was passing all my classes but I just didnt feel the same. I got my first job working for a grocery story my first semester of sophomore year. I began making new friends and laid off the drugs sometime. I started smoking weed with my roommates shortly after and felt any depressed feelings I had go away. That year was fine I just went with the flow of thingsJunior year of college is where things started to get shaky again. I was still smoking weed 24/7 is what it felt like just to feel happy. I ended up getting a D in a class for my major which put me even more behind in school. I remember after figuring this out that I once again wanted to kill myself thinking Im worthless, wasting my parents money, and so on. One day I snapped because I was cooking burgers on a grill and I just couldnt flip them because they were breaking apart(I know now to add egg to hold them together) and I got in my car and took off. I called my parents and told them I was going to drop out of school and join the marines to put my time in and earn an education by making my own money first. They consoled me and said they didnt care I didnt pass and what not. I cried that night and it had been years but at least for now I had avoided either joining the marines or committing suicide. After this event I began taking the gym seriously and went from 155lb to 195lb by the next summer. I was fit and in good shape I guess I still am as Ive been working out ever since. Beginning of this year in college I had a friend who was a girl telling me I looked hot and was going to be getting girls left and right. I felt like I could because girls noticed but still in the back of my head I was ugly and no one would ever date me so I never really tried to put myself out there. I meet a girl that I have two classes with and we started to talk and hangout. I began to have feelings for her but kept them hidden because I found out she has a boyfriend that she did not tell me about her friends did. I thought she was beginning to like me too but now my suspicions led me to a conclusion that she doesnt shes just a sweet person. This is crushing me to this moment because she will still text random things. Also to add to it I have gone out and danced with girls but I just cannot pull together any confidence because of what was said about me senior year. I began to have real suicidal thoughts again. All my friends would have their girlfriends come over and I would just be by myself. I would hang out with them and act like everything was fine but deep down Im hurting worse than ever before. I feel like I will never find a girl because of my stupid insecurities that have bothered me for years.So this last week I finally quit my job because I felt like it was wearing down on me and giving me even more suicidal thoughts but I dont thinks its helped.  I could talk about so much more but I feel like this is a good spot to end. Ive thought that these are my last days Im just going to go for a drive with my rifle to a beautiful spot and do what I should have done years ago.  Thanks to anyone that takes the time to read thisWith love,AmazingRob","1"
"I attempted suicide three years ago. I got some help - I'm on meds now, I did therapy, the whole damn thing. I honestly don't feel like they did anything but pull me an inch or two back from the brink. I feel like I ruined my life with my depression and inability to function for those couple of years. I attempted shortly after getting out of college, and my severe depression kept me from finding a job. Now I'm three years out and I've never managed to get one. I'm unemployable because I spent so long just trying not to die. I have a large amount of student loan debt I'm never going to be able to pay off because it's collecting interest while I can't find work.I also gained a significant amount of weight. I've been trying to work on it and I've failed that over and over, too. I lost touch with all my old friends. I reach out to them and they just don't answer. I can't blame them - I dropped everything, including them. I just hate it. I don't have any resources with which to rebuild my life. I cannot imagine how any of this gets better. You'd think I'm fairly young but I don't have anything or any energy and I hate where I am so much.","1"

"I'm a senior in college (early 20s) and recently finally felt like I was on the right track in terms of my career/mental health/social relationships after years of struggling - with depression, crippling anxiety, and uncertainty about the future. I felt like things were finally starting to come together and I was making progress. Then I had a surgery that did not go as planned, leaving me with functional impairments that have destroyed any hope of pursuing my dream career, have brought back my depression and anxiety in full force, and are starting to tear away at my relationships with friends and family. I don't want to go into detail about my medical situation in case any friends/family stumble upon this, but it's an invisible chronic condition. Doctors look down on you or turn you away if they can't find the answers; and friends and family think you are exaggerating, or crazy, or simply lazy and always making excuses (before I was affected by this, I have to admit that I probably would have also reacted with the same amount of doubt/indifference). Worse, the surgeon responsible for this has abandoned me with the problems he created.I can see things only spiraling downward as time goes on -- no one likes to be around someone who is unwell and is not getting better; after only a few months I can see that already. I used to be hardworking, a perfectionist. My one constant that kept me going in life even as I struggled in other areas (socially, emotionally) was my ability to get things done and do work well. Now I barely get through the day, spend the majority of my time sleeping and the rest of it trying to scrape by doing the bare minimum. My impairments have made it impossible to enjoy anything anymore - work, school, friends, family, hobbies, entertainment. There is a chance I'll get better but I'll need to spend the next several years of my life in this state, while chasing treatments and doctor visits most of which will probably be futile, and spending thousands of dollars (getting myself and/or my family into debt). I'll lose everything that I feel like makes me who I am -- so even if I find a successful treatment, what for? I don't know if I could rebuild my life from scratch several years from now after losing all my relationships, academic and career progress, and the stability in my mental health I'd worked for years to get to. I'll probably be reliant on my parents years from now, when I had been planning to move out immediately after graduating and support myself.I feel like I'd rather end it here, before my life deteriorates to that point. I've spent a good few hours every single day for months contemplating suicide. I used to try to handle my depression by living 'in the present' (practicing mindfulness) and planning for a better future. Both of those things are extremely challenging now as I'm constantly under physical stress, and I have little to look forward to as all my short and long term future plans have been shot. The main thing keeping me around is knowing that if I end things it will absolutely crush my dad, who already isn't in good health himself. I also know that I'm not truly suicidal in that I don't want to die-- if I could revert back to a healthy body right here and now I would absolutely continue with life. I just don't know if or when that will happen, and until then every day is an excruciating and draining experience. I feel trapped.TL;DR surgical mistake ruined my life. Living just to live. Wishing I could end things - sort of.","1"
"I bought a gun. I'm waiting until the holidays are over, to spare friends and family from extra pain. Don't really have anyone to talk to, people all say the same things. ""You're a good person."" ""You can move forward."" I know better, I know myself. Dropped out of college because of depression, failed a suicide attempt, never went back to school. I can only get shitty jobs without a degree, the shitty jobs make me angrier and angrier until I quit with no back-up plan. Then inertia and depression take hold again. My work history is a series of 9-12 months working with 3-6 months of nothing in-between. I have no explanation for the employment gaps, the places willing to hire someone like me are increasingly shitty. I've proven to myself time and time again that I'll never get it together. I've barely left my house since September. The only thing that tempers the constant anxiety is drinking, but with how much money I spend on booze my savings won't last long. I lack willpower, I give up so easily, I've been that way since I was a kid. So now I'll give up one last time. This post is pointless, sorry for carrying on.","1"

"I only have one reason left to live, my daughter. I don't want her to go through life saddled with the burden of her father abandoning her. I also don't want her to go through life saddled with the burden of having a father who is a broken shell of a man. I have seen therapists, I even was trained as a ""peer helper"" (basically student suicide prevention) in high school, i know all the things people are supposed to say, and all the things I'm supposed to think. Nothing helps. The truth is that my life is an epic failure. I am extremely talented and creative but have been unable to turn that into a living. I have been given every opportunity, including attending the second most prestigious music college in the country, but made nothing of it. I am still madly in love with my wife. She is beautiful and smart and caring but hasn't been in love with me for a long time, and last night she confirmed that it's been years since she's desired physical intimacy with me and would prefer it if we just didn't anymore.  My whole life I have felt that a day job is worse than death. I have failed at every job I've tried.  I have enough college credits for a masters degree, but they are all random and don't even add up to an associate. I sold my car, my most prized possession, in order to pay the rent for a few more months. I have possibly the greatest kid in the world, my daughter who is 3, but i feel our bond breaking as the darkness creeps in. If i were to describe my situation in third person to anyone I know they would say ""wow, that dude is a worthless piece of shit, she should leave him and find someone better"" and they'd be right. I keep thinking maybe I should check myself in somewhere, but besides the fact that I don't know if that's even a real thing for someone in my financial situation, nothing would change while I'm there. My problems aren't imaginary things that can be talked or medicated away. I would still be unemployed and unemployable, my wife would probably be even more distant but also never feel at ease again, my daughter would feel abandoned. Plus it's the holidays and that would ruin their Christmas. I want to want to be alive so fucking bad. I don't think I have for a year, maybe two. ","1"

"I know it's late and not many people are on at this time of day, but what is the meaning of it all? I don't know what to do anymore and I feel lonely and depressed sometimes.  I'm about to graduate high school and I feel like I didn't really have fun. I know what I'm doing afterwards for college, but I feel like I won't have any friends. Do people typically make new friends in college? I feel like I wasted a lot of opportunities due to me being socially inept and fearful of it. I feel like I will end up alone after this school year with no one. If I fail in college I feel like my life is completely over. I'm not feeling too bad today, but I want to hear some input from people here. I don't want to take resources away from people who are in urgent need right now. Do you have a reason for living?","1"

"I dont know what to do anymore... theres this guy that I cant stop loving we broke up about 9 months ago because I was just a horrible person to him. Since then Ive bettered myself Ive been happier and Ive looked within and stoped hating myself Ive changed Im overall a better person than who I was long ago. I wanted him to see this but he doesnt trust me anymore.. so a few days ago he sends me a message out of the blue, I dont know how he got my new number, and we start talking and my feeling for him instantaneously came back I was trying to bury those feelings. And hes in a relationship and I was like ok thats good maybe now I can finally get over him.. a few days later he cheats on his SO with me And at first I dont want to do that because I had respect for him and his relationship but he kept pushing and Im so weak and says he loves me and it was everything Ive ever wanted, and it  happened multiple times over the course of a few days... A few days later he told me he was confused and he couldnt choose between me or them... he was basically playing with my feelings... and today he blocks me and I just want to cry and die I didnt do anything wrong this time... and I know how stupid it is to cry or kill yourself over a man but my heart is just full of pain I hope it just stops on its own at this point.. I just dont want to live life without him thanks for reading about my stupidity","1"
"I am a kid, but please know that this isnt some kid messing around, i just really want to end myself or talk to someoneI have had a voice in my head for quite a few years, saying stuff like ""you should hurt your friend"" ""you should kill them"" and I knew that this stuff was wrong so i haven't until now. A few hours ago, i attempted to poison my parents. they kept nagging me and i was In a bad mood and didn't want to listen to them, and they yelled at me after me yelling at them. I put bleach in their tea and waited, i was home alone. I realized that the bleach wouldn't work after a while then i dumped out the tea and realized what i had just done. I had just tried to kill my parents. I'm so disappointed and disgusted at myself. I want to end myself for this awful thing i have done. That weird voice in my head though always tells me to hurt people. I got in school suspension for hurting kids that don't deserve it, twice. I realized all of my past actions and my actions today, and I want to end myself for this awful thing I tried to do. If I don't end myself, I will end up telling my parents and they will submit me into a mental hospital, I don't want to go into a mental hospital. If i don't kill myself then I will just suffer forever until I die. I don't know what to do, and I'm scared.","1"
"I tried to kill myself when i was 8, drunk shit ton of pills because I dont want to go to school the next day. Then attemp after attemp at shitty methods I just try to live with it.It get worse lately, I tried to drown myself, thought about jump of a high place or just something to end my life again. I cant go to theraprist, I have no money, family wont understand and telling them will just make it worse.

"I've been thinking of killing myself for ages and a few years ago I made a proper attempt by jumping of a bridge which landed me in a hospital which I survived as you might have noticed. I spend some time after that talking with people and kinda just acted like everything was fine since it didn't feel like the talking was helping.It's not necesarily that I hate life, it's just that I find it kind of useless and don't really see any use for it which makes me think things like ""why not just end it right now"" but the thing thats keeping me back currently is what if I fail again. If i fail another attempt everyone around me most likely wont be very happy while I don't really care that much (I know it sounds kinda selfish) it's just that it brings a lot of problems which I don't really want to deal with. I know it is kinda selfish to throw my problems around and let other people help me solve them but I've been stuck with this for ages and I just don't know what to do anymore, so I'm sorry for that.","1"

"I feel like I've tried a lot of options, and it all just falls back to the same mindset. I have gotten help, made friends, talked to a counselor, and gone out of my way to try and be productive by getting part time jobs while improving my grades to nearly honors. I've been talking to a counselor for months and on Paxil for months and gone up in dose a few times but it all just eventually falls down again. Sometimes I feel alright when I can distract myself but I don't want to live on distractions like that. I don't know how to explain my state of mind, I guess it's that I don't have that much stress but when I start to lose interest in everything and nothing is fun or worth effort than I don't see why I would try to endure any stress. Even when it's just having to do a 5 minute assignment, when I can't find anything motivating besides getting punished for not doing it (which has worn out as a motivator too to literally nothing) i just blank out I guess and it feels the absolute worst. I wish I could be rich, so I could just relax and sleep all the time, with no worries or obligations. I don't think I could ever make it as a functioning adult for long, I would crumble. I'm just so lazy and tired, I don't know if it's something wrong with me or if I don't deserve to be serene and I phased by anything. I bought pets and keep reminding myself of my family to make myself committed to obligation, but that's been whittled down to the bare minimum to where I wouldn't care. My dad has clinical depression, and so does his mom (its genetic), so there is a big chance if I died he would kill himself. That thought stopped me for a while but now I can't even bring myself to care. I've called a hotline and just rambled for a while a few times. I have no ideas anymore, I don't want to have to struggle to get out of bed for no reason, I just don't know what to do","1"

"Well, I don't have a normal family. They don't even talk to each other and they really hate each other. My father even used a knife to threaten my mother in the past. Every single day they would constantly badmouth each other. But I think they won't divorce because of me and my siblings. My parents won't ever change. I'm also anti-social with no friends. I'm also that shy kid who is afraid to speak up. I also have no ambition, no dreams in life. I also work in Mcdonalds which makes me more depressed. I work there because I have nothing to do and I usually spend my day watching youtube videos or play video games. Sounds pretty pathetic right?  I also rarely go outside. In Mcdonalds, some people are really really nice towards me but some are just mean. The words they said really hurt me a lot. I'm sort of new to the place and not quite how to do things fast. The mean things that they said to me really made me more depressed and hurt. There was once a manager scolded me really bad but I held my tears. But the moment I reached home I cried secretly to sleep. I had no one to talk to since nobody would understand. When I said I wanted to die, my siblings and parents don't take me seriously and joke it off. I really want to die but I'm too afraid of hurting myself. I am always restless too. Life has no meaning for me. I am many insecurities about myself like my weight, face, and confidence. I really wish that I have a complete family and friends who can understand and help me. When people ask me when I was happy, I can't even remember when I was really happy since in my life I was never happy in the first place.Thank you for taking your time reading this. Really appreciated it.","1"
"I dont know what Im expecting from writing this. I'm sorry for the wall of text. Today I got a letter from my high school. I'm about to get kicked out of the third school. I'm 1 year from graduation. I've tried three times and every time I convinced myself that I will pull through with a fresh start. School itself, was never really a big deal, apart from maths. Its been the exact same rundown of events on all 3 high schools. New surroundings. New friends. The Term starts off, I feel great for about 2 months, everything is perfectly in order. Then, Im beginning to stay home for a day - then a few days and suddenly I realise that Ive not been going to school for 2 weeks. The stuff Ive missed out on, starts stacking up and becomes this outrageously big pile of work. This is when Teachers start talking to me. From this point on its a rollercoaster of emotions. Some days I feel extremely optimistic and enthusiastic, like I can easily manage to catch up and get everything done in a breeze. These up-phases usually wear off very fast, like a crash back into reality. Afterwards I tend to ignore my problems for a while, convincing myself that there are other things to do, like cleaning my apartment or spending the night playing videogames. Then the down-phase kicks in. 0 motivation, 0 energy. Days go by and Im just lying in bed without eating or doing anything but sleeping. This phase varies in lengths, typically between 2 to 10 days or even longer. The down phase is followed by an enthusiastic up phase. The whole cycle continues, while my school attendance shrinks. I miss out on important assignments. Tests. Then Im given a big warning by letter: Last chance, get your shit together or we have to throw you out. No problem. Im telling everyone that its no problem. Everything is fine. Worst of all, Im telling and convincing myself that everything is fine. The cycle continues. Up-phase .. crash .. down-phase and so on.Im 20 years old. Reserved, quiet and trying to always be friendly. I moved out when I was 17, because of my single mothers schizophrenia, which had gotten worse over the years and turned into unbearable conflicts, for a 17-year-old. I was very depressed and had suicidal thoughts in the time leading up to this. The rest of my family lives over 800km away from my place and we barely have contact. My mom disallowed contact with them, so the first time I met them was after I moved out. Theyre very nice people, but I dont really feel like a part of the family yet. I avoid contact with them. I have four cousins and the youngest, who is 2 years younger than me, is about to graduate this year. The other three cousins are attending university already. I never told them that I changed school a second time, because I was ashamed. I just told them that everything is fine.Now on to the last thing. Im kind of addicted to videogames. Not a specific one, just games in general. Ive spend thousands upon thousands of hours in League of Legends, Counter Strike, MMORPGs and various other games. I got my first computer when I was 12 and I immediately started fleeing into the world of games, to hide from bullying in prime school and later the problems with my mother. It started off as being a winter-season thing but evolved into excessive gaming in all my spare time. I gave up gaming for a year after moving out to another city, where I worked for a year before I started in the second school. After school finally started again, I slowly fell back into old gaming habits. I was used to hiding from sadness and problems this way. And I still am. Im not playing that excessive any more, but still around 30 hours a week. This contributes its share to the whole slump Im in. Ive tried quitting gaming, but I just found myself swapping to other distractions, like binge-watching YouTube.At this point I dont know what to do anymore. Im tired of trying and failing. I dont see myself managing to get my shit together. Im kind of just silently watching my life break apart finally. The sadness has gotten to the point where I dont feel like crying a lot anymore. It is more like acceptance. Like an Antelope caught by a Lion. Like someone whos falling off a cliff. There is no point in struggling anymore. Like Im already dead inside. Still Telling everyone that Im fine, everything is fine. I dont want to bother people. Im ashamed of myself. I want to die. help.","1"

"My cognitive dissonance is difficult to ignore, but also difficult to notice. I've put myself into a dissociated state so that I can fulfill what I believe to be my life's purpose: causing as little trouble for other people as possible. I'm aware of the fact that this is likely untrue, but through much internal arguing, I've determined that I should live in this unrealistic reality. The trouble is that the ultimate way to cause no problems for others is to cease my existence. Since I am still arguing with myself over my amount of self-worth and whether or not to depress my will to live, I am willing to ask for help in order to make absolutely certain that suicide is the right choice. Thank you for reading this post, I appreciate any responses.","1"
"I feel like a part of me is just damage and filthy and broken and that I can't fix it. There's so much shit in my past that went wrong that I've bene dealing with and trying to just let go because there is no way I can work though it all. But I just feel like I've lost purity or wholesomeness and I feel like I'm just this depressed mess that I can't fix. I'm 18, none of my family knows that I'm depressed or have any mental issues, it's been so hard to live with them because they argue constantly and make a really unhappy living environment. I finally got good friends that love and support me and they know about my awful depression but we're all graduating this year and I'm so so so afraid to lose my friends because I don't even want to make new ones. Life doesn't seem worth it anymore, I don't get the point of it all, I'm just going to die one day and there's not much of a difference if I do it know, and I know it would upset so many people and I feel so bad about that but I just don't want to live at all anymore. We work so hard in life for nothing, so many people are hardly ever happy with their job or house or whatever else, this world is not forgiving or kind. I do not want to be a part of a place like this, I'm so exhausted. ","1"
"Hello everyone. I just wanted share my view.I am in my early 30's. Not child and not veteran. As i see life right now, it is colorless and without taste. My earning is ok. So, no difficulties based on money. However, all my life is spent on career. I do like my work. It is my hobby and job. Information Technologies. Played a lot of games, watched animes, read a lot of mangas and comics. Nothing of those give enjoyment. Friends you will ask, All of them is Fake.No one cares. Even if i split my veins right now, only relatives will grieve for me. No one else. they may get upset a little bit and then they will judge. But for me it will be meaningless. Cause i was not alive for that moment. But Topic is not about it. How to fill emptiness? People, Society, life itself demands that i Play role. How i can fill emptiness when everyone just wants to use. Even i am ok being used in some circumstances, in order feel alive. But it is just for a moment. Main issue for me and for a lot of people there is no one try to understand. They just Judge, they bash it. I can't lie or use someone. How to get over it? Tell lies, Pretend to get someone like you. Get friends like in childhood. When person grown up, it is very difficult to get new friends... And in my case, no friends from childhood. Not from school, not from works where i worked. Maybe it is my fault, cause there was time range when i was in repeating and continuous Depression. BY relatives issues. I don't know. Solitude is killing me slowly, but why wait? Why not make it quick???In the end, Human being only do thing which benefits them... those who do it without thinking, is just....","1"

"Due to a lot of factors, but the biggest being excessively loneliness and isolation, and a long history of self-loathing, i wandered home one day last week a little drunk. My roommate was out of town for the day, so i was alone. I had this very weird sensation of having my life in my hands, and i remember sitting down with a bottle of rum and a shotglass, and deciding to see if i could drink myself unconscious. Shot. Shot. Shot. I have this little voice in the back of my head that freaks out whenever i do something dangerous, and i remember it saying ""watch out, patrick. People have died from drinking too much."" And i remember feeling encouraged and sort of disoriented at the same time. More shots. ""No,"" i thought. ""Im just drinking until the pain stops. Im not actually trying to die. Just pass out in bed, is all.""I remember writing to a friend ""is that why its called a shot? Cause it feels like sitting here with a loaded gun in my hand.""What happened was my roommate came back a few hours early. I was embarassed so i stopped drinking, ended up vomitting, and just went to bed.I don't know if this could actually be considered a suicide attempt. Part of me thinks there were definitely moments in that ""session"" where i was pushing to die. But part of me is like ""no those were just random thoughts you had. You were just drinking cause you were lonely. You would never ACTUALLY have done it.""I dont know. I dont know how to process this event. I dont know what i did, or what it really means.","1"

"I was late. I've always been late, for everything. I've always had this desire to stop. Not really to fail, just to stop doing anything. Somethimes, in the morning, I would heat up the water in my shower. I would undress. The mirror would fog up. But I'd just stand there, then slink to the floor. I'd lie on the floor and just do nothing for an hour. My family would always tease me about how long I took in the bathroom, both to get ready and shit. I lied to them, when I was in middle school. I told them I was always sick, that I always had diarrhea or constipation. IBS the doctor called it. But I had no issue. I'd just sit there, on the toilet, for hours. I want to say immobile but I was perfectly capable of moving. I had the same problem in my dreams. I sleep through earthquakes and gunshots but also alarms. I hear them, though, half awake and lucid. I, in my most lucid, ignore them. I'd always rather dream. The antidepressants didn't fix this. I said I tried to kill myself, but I gave up halfway through the pill bottle. They gave me zoloft. It made me thoughtless. For years now, ever since I started taking the meds, my whole live has felt like watching the bathroom mirrors fog up. I couldn't even cook or exercise anymore.In school, I did fine. I payed attention when others spoke, always. But when I got home or sat in the library, I had problems. I would barely do homework. I would sleep or play dumb games. Video games were the only thing I did. They feel like dreams a lot of the time. I rarely watch shows or movies, just play grindy video games. So I didn't do well in school.What I did that made my boss fire me was that I showed up at the wrong hours. I was supposed to work 11 to 5 but I thought 5 to 11. My family's going to be upset again. My father finally thought I'd made it out. I could barely hold a job before this, but it felt different. I don't know what he's going to do, I'm still sitting in my car in the parking lot Ironically, what kept me from committing suicide before was the requirement to plan, to have action. But now I don't know. I don't want to confront my family or friends or bosses anymore. I let them all down, even the teachers who believed in me. I would rather die than go home, but it's hard to put the keys in the ignition right now.","1"

She is married, but not happy, and then she told me how much she loved my eyes and voice, could listen to me all day, how much I made her happy. Then she stopped it and we went on as friends.I Left work, she got me a card saying Thank you sooo much for your friendship, for listening to me crying, for laughter, for understanding me like no other I told her I loved her, and then a few weeks later she was angry because I told someone else I had feelings for her. Then she stopped replying, I begged and pleaded to just have the friendship back, she blocked me in everything and havent heard from her since.I got her through a tough time this year, and she just left, same as my ex who dumped me one month after I got her through an emotional breakdown abroad. These people tell me how wonderful I am at the start, heap praise on me, but nobody sticks around for even a year.I must be a total fuck up to ruin anything, nobody is really interested in me and Ive got nothing to offer and think Ill be alone forever.

"I am 33, diagnosed schizophrenic since 21 and just now diagnosed as epileptic. I have lost my ability to even drive. I have 20 or more hospitalizations for observation, multiple previous attempts with one involving a firearm. There is no getting better. Functioning and remission basically mean I am not psychotic. I still barely eat. I forget to shower for days or a week or more. I still hear voices.That's on the medication. The medication gives me fast heart rate, constant nausea and extreme fatigue and lethargy.

Im a monster, and monsters deserve to go to Hell, dont they? Sorry if I didn't make much sense, I'm just really tired right now. ","1"
"EDIT (11/25/17)I just want to tell you all thank you so much, I'm feeling less pain as before, I'm really thankful for all your support and I feel a bit better, I'm currently getting the help I need.When I was 4 years old, I was diagnosed with Aspergers, ever since then, I've recovered and now function as a regular human being, and I don't struggle with those symptoms anymore, yet I'm ashamed for even having Aspergers in the first place, and because people know I had it, they verbally abuse me and it still hurts me, even though I don't ever see myself as ""autistic"". I don't want to be seen as different, I just want to feel normal, yet society won't let me. Everyone tells me to ""embrace"" having autism, yet I can't, everybody hates me for having it and sees me as a freak. I just want to fucking kill myself, but I live in a Canada, a place where I can't just painlessly shoot myself in the head with a gun. This life is no longer worth living, I just want to die right this second if I could.","1"
"I was told to take this story here for advice. My husband recently sent a text to a friend of his saying he was going to kill himself. The friend reached out to me and it was all taken care of.

"I'm a 19 year old girl. I don't want to die. I'm terrified at the idea that I will one day be gone regardless of anything I do, so I feel like I need to take control of that and decide when my time is. I was abused for years by my dad and sexually assaulted by another man but people don't believe me and somehow I seem to get the blame for these things. Even being conscious is unbearably painful. My heart feels heavy and my body feels numb and I feel trapped in my own body. Everyone says I'm very pretty and I'm very philosophically and artistically intelligent and I feel like I have the potential to do amazing things- even change the world, but none of it seems worth anything. I can't use those things to do anything worthwhile because I'm stuck in the body of someone who feels pain just being awake. I can't even hold down a minimum wage retail job so how am I ever going to progress from there? I am alone in this world even though I'm not and that's the scariest place to be in. I have been to A&E before telling them that I'm suicidal, only to be told to go home and treated like I'm wasting their time. If anyone has any words of comfort at all it could make all the difference, thank you.","1"

"I'm not really sure how to word this, so I'm just gonna write down some reasons why I'm killing myself. I feel kinda shitty making this since I don't wanna seem like I'm baiting for pity comments, I'm just making this as a last little message sorts thing.. Sounds kinda  stupid, doesn't it? Its not really like anyone will be looking for this on purposeSo basically, I cracked the top of the skull open in daycare and had be rushed into the hospital. Its kinda funny became I remember the cause of it was I was running around being a character from a show I loved to watch, I think he was called ""Diesel"" or something and he had a claw. I was chasing my friend and my head hit the top of a poll in the playgroundI was also molested by my father when I was 7, I didn't realize the things he did was bad until I was 10. My sister is a slut (literally) and my brother has anger issues so living with them was hard.All I really do is play video games, watch Netflix, I'm a huge waste of space. My life dog named amber passed away recently. He was a shitzoo, just watching him being put down was terrifying.I was bullied in school a lot. Had my noes broken, right leg twisted and a bunch of cuts. Those are the main reasons for why I'm killing myself. Tried sleeping pills, still can't sleep. I'm extremely depressed, got a phycologists and I'm still depressed.I think suicide is something people look onto as a bad thing, but its really just a shortcut for life. I mean, we're all gonna die anyway. Suicide isn't selfish in my opinion, being an edgy attention whore is. I'll be taking knockout pills and standing on a chair with my head in a noose, the plan is that I'll fall asleep and get hanged. If it takes too long, I'll just do it myself","1"

"Long story short, her job is emotionally crippling her. Her co-teacher keeps commenting on how useless she is and the AP of the department is very close friends with the co-teacher so the complaints are brushed off. The principal of the school is very apathetic to the situation as well, only really telling her to get along with the co-teacher. She would leave the job except she's in a program that helps pay for her Master's and if she leaves, she's out of the program and any amount that has been covered has to be paid by her.Today we spent time together and I fell asleep. While I was asleep, she wrote a suicide note on her phone and made sure I knew the password to her phone. After I made a comment about how her stress right now is similar to how it was during middle school when she was heavily bullied, she showed me the note. I managed to calm her down and I gave her a contact number for a college therapist and I'm gonna talk to my sister in law's sister since she's a psychiatrist for the military.

"Hi,This year was not enjoyable for me. Got a job, t'was easy but then I quit for another, but then that job was pretty downright toxic so I gave notice and left.Currently have another job which I'm not really cut out for to be honest. The pressure with unemployment pushed to go through with the job, it's not that bad except the role itself was just not made for me and I'm going 3 weeks in.I am very sad, unhappy, dissatisfied. Everyday I just contemplate on just killing myself and ending it all. As a child, I was pushed by  my parents to do hobbies/things that seemed productive but to me were the biggest hassles in my life and that influenced me to be the indecisive, cluster fuck that doesn't know what to do next unless pushed by some external force.I deserve to be unhappy, I guess. I'm not a fucking saint at all, but I'm no demon. At the end of the day, I'm lost, I don't know what to do, I find solace in doing things I'm good at , but those things don't bring in money, just plain emotional satisfaction.I want to kill myself lmao and I mean it. Everyday is just such a fucking burden. There is no point to all of this, playing, studying, getting a job, eating, sleeping, breathing. I don't want to bother anymore. I do not have close family ties, I prefer it that way. I've been raised in a cold environment, better than an abusive home/environment, but that's just me providing insight. I've got nobody nor do I feel the need to socialize.I guess that's it for now.","1"
"I did absolutely nothing during middle and high school, no homework, no chores, no hobby, no responsibilities.I was kinda ok in english. So i went to only uni in my city with english-related degrees, i would get bachelor and become english/french teacher. First two years were absolute boredom, i still had no hobbies etc, french was very hard for me. I barely made it thru 5th semester. Most of classes or whatever they are called were either useless for me or very easy or i would pass them because teacher didnt give a fuck. I felt worthless, i did nothing but played games all day, i started skipping classes, even if i did show up lectures were basically useless and regular classes were boring as fuck, i dont think i learned anything  new, last time i was in class teacher told us to find epithets in text, same shit as middle school just in other language.So i failed  6th sem because i skipped every class, i just played games. I tried to go ""pro"" but i was either too bad or unlucky. 7th semester comes, there is almost no way for me to recover, im deducted. I love my parents, they love me too, but i dont think they believe in me, they know im a disappointment. For the last year im just leaving home at random times and they think i still go to uni.I talked to them last month, i told them that i want to drop uni that i hate my life and want to end it all. They said i shouldnt, they hate their lives too but i should carry on, but its too late. They still dont know. I need a ""reference"" from my uni that says im still at uni to get a extra bit of money. Today i got a mail that says i should go to army, you only get it if you're not in uni. I told my mom that they fucked up something, i still havent talk to my father. I lost my parents 1000$ playing games instead of studying.im waste of human life. i dont think i have guts to end myself, im ashamed of myself. I can recover at uni but  whole thing might happen again. If i do they will know and despise me, same thing happened to my brother 10 years ago and my mom still didnt recover. im completely unambitious, i dont want anything, i dont deserve anything. i hate myself and im afraid. i will go to uni in 30 mins to see if i can recover and get that reference, sem is almost over so i might have a chance. my mom really wants me to get bachelor and i dont want let her down. i would tell them everything this evening if i knew they wouldnt get mad or sad that im such a disappontment, even if i recover i dont know if i can keep up but i will try.Im sorry if this post doesnt belong there, im an idiot and barely deserve any pity, but my parents are good people and i really REALLY hate myself for being such a disappointment. uni is easily worst thing in my life and thats the only thing they care about im also fat and unattractive i wish i didnt exist","1"

"I can't seem to get anyone to think I am important or valuable enough to stick around. I really fucking hate this. I ask myself every morning, but particularly on days like this. why was i born? I didn't ask for this.I'm in the early half of my 20's and I am, in spite of all of my problems, a highly successful individual. I already work in my dream job of being a researcher and I am pursuing a PhD. However, despite all this success I am a garbage human being who nobody loves. Sure I am a good scientist but why does it matter if nobody wants me? If i am only good for what i produce why do I have to be alive?I am at my last straw. I was violently abused for my entire childhood and I have PTSD and severe abandonment issues because no one ever loved me. I developed chronic illness and pain at 19 and for years now have never had a day in good health or no pain since. I've been depressed since I was like 10 or so... Until I was about 14 or so my only friends were online. I managed to escape my abusive household and moved 3000 miles away only to end up in an abusive relationship for the first half of my undergrad. he was emotionally abusive and then it turned physical. he hit me, he raped me constantly, i hated it. i managed to get away from him. i made friends. life seemed good for a while and then I tried to start dating again. well, over these last (now exceeding) 2 years I have been horrendously unsuccessful. every time I spend a few weeks~months seeing someone I think they actually like me and then when i breach the subject they dont want to be with me. at first it didnt bother me so much but after it being a pattern for 2 yrs now. it makes me want to dieduring this time i've also developed a very successful career as a scientific researcher. this is my dream. i work directly on issues that make people's lives better and i have been thanked by the communities i work with. this is the only good thing in my life. work is funding my phd. it is the only time i am happy. everything else is shit.all my friends moved away this last few months to pursue their lives while i stay in the same city we all went to school in. i also significantly reduced my friend group this past summer because a friend of a friend decided it would be cool to rape me involving the use of a weapon. i didnt want to be friends with him anymore because his predatory friend hurt me. so anyone i didn't trust enough got axed.so fast forward to a few months ago, i met someone online who i immediately really clicked with. i think it's been a little more than two months? we hung out a lot and cuddled and stuff and i felt very emotionally close to this person. i finally found someone i enjoyed being around because of the person they are, instead of just trying to fill a void. i thought things were finally going well in this sphere. last night we ended up having a conversation about how we felt and he said he didnt know what he was looking for and had an aversion to something more serious right now. i respect that but i also can't help but feel despair. the person who i thought really cared doesn't.also, i have ASD. it makes it so hard for me to socialize and be normal. but yeah, surprise, people with autism do have emotions and feel very intensely. i was so excited i thought i found someone who cared about me and didn't care about my weird ass flaws. i was wrongi really hate being alive. it hurts. i am going to go to a lawyer this week to set up a last will and testament to ensure my remaining funds go to my little brother to help him with college since i know my fucking parents won't help him. i am so sorry to everyone. i can't do it anymore. i give up. i can't deal with a world where i don't feel like i belong every. fucking. day.it doesn't matter how successful you are if you can't find someone to share that happiness with. i am done. i already have a plan. i haven't made a plan like this in years because i thought i was stronger than this. but i am not.if somehow anyone reading this knows who this is by virtue of details then im sorry. i love you. but i cant. anymore. im so sorry i am weak. life hurts too bad. i was dealt shitty cards but i don't want to play them anymore. i want to set my hand down and i want to feel like i feel when i'm asleep because it's the only fucking time i don't feel this agonizing pain of both my body fucking destroying me and society rejecting me outright. i wish someone would fucking kill me so i didn't have to do it. i really do. but i know what i need to do to make it happen. i will tie up loose ends and ensure my legal ducks are in a row, but i am going to be dead by the end of the year. i quit. i fucking quit.","1"

"Almost a year ago, on New Year's Eve, I stood on a beach and was on the verge of jumping in the water (in the middle of winter in Chicago, mind you), and drowning myself. The day itself was rather terrible - I had not been invited by anyone to any party, I had been turned down by a girl I liked (it broke my heart, but in retrospect, I realized that it wouldn't have worked out), and I was depressed that I could not find work, no matter how hard I tried. At the very last second, a voice in my head - or my heart - stopped me. Alive, but still depressed, I drove back home.The months to follow were uneventful, until out of the blue, I got a call in May from a family friend who offered me a summer job working as a site supervisor (and practically as an interim building manager) during a renovation job at a subsidized living community. I said yes, the hiring process was expedited, and I started working as soon as I could. $20/hr, 8 hrs a day, M-F, an hour from lunch, not even 10 minutes from home, met some great people, and enjoyed the environment so much, that it sparked an interest in property management and construction/development as a career choice.In the beginning of July, I had lost my best friend, due to a falling out where he accused me of something that I never thought anyone - let alone my best friend whom I've known since 5th grade - would accuse me of. Needless to say, it was hard. Though I felt that we were slowly going in different directions in terms of life plans, that disintegration would have happened over the course of a good year or two, but to have this happen so suddenly - thank God I had work to keep me occupied.Losing my best friend had an impact on my social life; it was difficult to socialize because I am an introvert (or, I suppose 'extremely guarded', or simply 'reticent', would be the appropriate term; I can be quite sociable, but it takes me a while to warm up to people), and when you lose your best friend of nearly 15 years, it doesn't tend to make you the life of the party.As work came to a close at the end of August/beginning of September, I applied, and was accepted, to a 15-month MBA program at a nearby university (it's well-known and well-respected, particularly for business, but I won't say which), which is going really well.My depression has started to kick back in as I've still not found a new job (and I am genuinely hungry and driven for new opportunities now, compared to a year ago), and...well, this girl (there's a lot of that on here, but bear with me).My love life has been rather stagnant this year; I've gone on a few dates, but none of those girls really interested me. I didn't feel a connection, so I didn't get hung up on it - I simply moved on. But this past Tuesday, I saw a girl who I met a year ago, and something came over me. A year ago, we met at a get-together at her Grandmother's house that I went to with my Dad (he couldn't drive due to his hemorrhoids, so he asked if I would mind), I was in a rather shitty mood that day for some reason, I didn't make much effort to converse, we 'hugged goodbye', wished each other well, and I didn't think I would see her ever again.Fast forward to Tuesday, my Dad and I went to the party (he drove this time), and the moment I walked in the door, everyone remembered me: her parents, her grandmother, her grandmother's sister (who made it a point to tell me several times how handsome I am), her uncles, and when she saw me, she practically power-walked over, gave me a big hug, and stood no greater than two inches from my face to talk to me. It was great, easy-going, no pretensions, no nerves, just a good conversation. As I saw my Dad getting ready to leave, I didn't even think, but it was rather instinctual, as if my mouth had opened on its own - I asked if she wanted to go out some time. She immediately replied with an excited ""absolutely!"" and said ""let me give you my number."" She put in my phone, we hugged, said 'bye', and I felt good on my way out.Yesterday, I texted her 'Happy Thanksgiving', to which she replied with the same. I then texted 'What are you doing Saturday?', and until this very moment, not a single reply. Now, would any guy feel a bit confused? Sure. Considering how great of a conversation we had on Tuesday, and how eager she was to give me her number, I don't understand why she didn't; respond. In my desire to understand, I went so far as to check the times of each message; her first reply was about 10 minutes after I texted, after which I texted about two-three minutes later, and...no reply.Perhaps I'm overthinking. Maybe she's busy (yesterday was Thanksgiving - I'll give her benefit of the doubt, I suppose), or I'm not a priority, but not a single response? The reason I'm upset by this, is because I actually like this girl. I know, someone will say that I like the idea of her, but I honestly feel a good vibe with this girl, especially after our conversation. Now, I'm racking my brain thinking:Am I not good enough?Is she replying to some other guy? What does he have that I don't?Why couldn't she just reply 'sorry, not interested'? I would appreciate the honesty.What the fuck did I do wrong?I know all of this is not constructive thinking, and it will get me nowhere, but for the first time this year, I meet (or, meet again) a girl that I actually like, and I wasn't even thinking about dating or relationships when we spoke; again, it was as if my mouth - not my brain or even heart - that asked her out.All day today, I've not eaten, because I'm hungry, but can't eat. I'm anxious, nervous, and now depressed. Those feelings from a year ago have come back. My possible failure with this girl has made me come to some heavy realizations: after turning 26 last week, I have no friends, no job, no girlfriend - nothing that a normal 26 year with a healthy life should have.Why do I feel this way? I don't care about someone filling out the 'role' of a girlfriend, but rather, I want a companion - someone to share things with; and when I think back to how great that conversation was - yes, I get a bit excited. Throw into the mix that I've spent almost my entire life bottling up my emotions and never truly expressing myself, that when one thing upsets me emotionally, everything starts to come out. And the fact is, I am actually comfortable in my own skin to want to express myself and open up to someone.It's only been a day, but it's been an entire day of asking myself if I'm loveable, and if I'll ever have a meaningful, fulfilling life. Why is it so easy for others? Why does everyone I see have a life that is happier and more fulfilling than mine? Don't I deserve an ounce of love and joy? The world doesn't owe me anything, but I'm human - I need love and joy like everyone else - when will it be my turn? It's really the companionship I long for; I feel that I am at a point in my left where I am ready to let someone in. A step at a time, but let someone in nonetheless. I am afraid that if I stay single for much longer, every ounce of love I have to give will have gone forever, and should someone come along who wants me for who I am, I may not be able to feel anything.Again, it's only been a day of these thoughts and feelings (and I've actually spent the day writing a short story to help take my mind off of these thoughts), but they remind me to much of where I was a year ago, and the pain is unbearable. I have a little over a month to go, but I may finally jump in the lake on New Year's Eve.If anything, one less emotional over-thinker in the world, making room for at least one lucky person with a bright future to shine, and have all the love and joy they want.","1"
" (Long repetitive rant I apologise..) I'm young and I have a lot of potential, but I just can't do it. I acknowledge how ""great"" I could be in the future, but it seems the longer I go on, the worse I get and I won't get better. Nothing will, this planet and the people on it are all turning to shit. I don't even feel connected with what is going on, it feels so unreal. I don't know what the actual fuck I'm doing with my life. Since January I've been incredibly depressed, it initially started as overthinking, then to disassociation, to full on emotional breakdowns every other night and a numb feeling. My birthday came along I was happy for a second, but then I felt sad, it was a strange feeling and it just kept getting worse. Especially then I was extremely stressed out about a certain regional band Audition, I didn't want to disappoint myself, my parents, my private lessons, my directors, etc.... And I didn't.. to some degree.. I ended up being in the top 10 players out of all the people who play my instrument in the region I live in. I was happy and excited for once, my achievement was amazing especially for someone my age with a bunch of older experienced players I was competing against. But in the next two days, my parents decided to break the news to me that I couldn't do it because I had failed one of my classes. I felt wonderful.  I had one week to fix the grade and the teacher in that class could've let me turn in, and she did let another girl turn work in, but no, not me. She deemed me lazy for not turning three unfinished assignments in, nope it wasn't because I constantly was unmotivated due to the fact that I was fucking majorly depressed and didn't feel like doing much at all, it was because I'm a lazy ass bitch who doesn't care. Yes. She didn't take my ""excuse"" because I was apparently ""lying"". That broke me, I worked so hard and I mean at the end of the day, I was still in the top 10, but it didn't mean anything, because someone had to replace me and that took something from me. And obviously, no one likes it when someone says their depression isn't real or ""that bad"". One the only times I was happy this year and it was taken away from me, now I'm back to the constant state of wanting to die. I want to get help, but because of old experiences I don't trust therapists or my parents much, so I turn to my friends. Turns out ""I'm going to kill myself"" and ""I want to die"" is what all the kids say now and it's ""a fucking joke."" I can't even go to my friends or anyone online, because I won't be taken seriously. It's now the holiday time, and I normally should be happy, but after all that happens ,unlike my previous years, I feel nothing and it's.. sad. I give up. Before, I used to be a little bit afraid of death, but now I don't mind, you can't escape it. My younger self would ask ""what would ____ think if I killed myself?"" and ""wouldn't  that  teach  them  a  lesson?"" I don't care much about that currently, it's not about teaching anyone a lesson, I don't want their pity when I'm dead. I don't want pity right now, either. I want help, but I don't think I'll ever get it. I've tried to kill myself when I was 11, I'm now in highschool and thinking about doing it again. I wish someone would understand how terrible I feel. I'm constantly trying to distract myself, but to do it every single day.. my life is a fucking mess. Every night I'll try to sleep, roll around for hours, and eventually I'll fall asleep and dream. It's the same dream each night, not necessarily a dream, but a nightmare about being raped. I've never been raped, but even in a dream it's traumatizing and I can't even get a break when sleeping. I am so tired and I just want a break.  I get the urge to slit my throat or wrist a lot, and I might actually do it. I'm done with all of this. ","1"
"I truly believe that life is meant to die. Nothing anyone does between life and death matters. We all trick ourselves into thinking that things we do matter, but they don't. If someone that cared about me said ""I wish you were dead,"" what a relief it would be. I could finally let go of this stupid life. But, I am forced to live in a hell of degeneracy, ignorance and poverty. I haven't met a single virtuous person in a long time. I am completely alone so suicide is the next logical step.","1"
"I want to live, but I can't in my situation. I'm trans and every day is a struggle for me. I can easily forget that I'm trans if I isolate myself and wear a lot of clothes, but if I somehow remember, or even see the word, I get a lot of dysphoria. It feels like I'm dying, and my brain is screaming at me, telling me something is wrong but I can't do anything about it. I can't even use the bathroom or take a shower without crying. I've been living as a boy for 2 years now, and as time goes by, I've realized that I can never live my life to the fullest. I'll never be seen as a real guy. I've always wanted to be a musician, but can't because if an old friend or something outed me, I'll forever be known as a ""trans musician"". It really hurts because making music is my passion and the only thing that keeps me alive. I can't make friends, either, because they always seem to find out. One of my friends is obviously questioning my gender and I've just been slowly avoiding him more and more, because that's pretty much all I can do. And even if everyone forgot that I was trans, I would still know. I would still have to live with the fact that I'll never be able to have biological kids. I'll still have to know that I'll never have an actual childhood, I've been extremely depressed ever since I was 5 and never got to experience the innocence and joy of being a kid. I'll never be able to do boring, mundane things that men do, like get a prostate exam or something. I'll always have to hear my grandparents refer to my brother and cousins as ""the boys"" and me as some weird other creature. I'll have to spend thousands of dollars and go through extremely painful surgeries just to not want to die every time I look in the mirror. I'll never be able to date. My first and only girlfriend fetishized me and didn't see me as a real boy. She lied about being bisexual so she could date me. My friends will say that they accept me, but will attack me for being trans and misgender me when we fight. My mom's side of the family says that they accept me, but shame me for taking hormones and wanting surgery. My mom says that she loves me and sees me as her son, but threatened to not sign the papers for my name change when I made her mad. She knew how important that was to me and used it against me. If my hormones didn't mess up when I was in the womb and I was born as a normal boy I wouldn't be suicidal. I guess I just need some advice and positivity.","1"
"Ill get straight to it. I'm so fucking alone.The few friends I had in the past were holding me back from moving my life forward so I removed them from my life. My family doesnt understand me at all and my 3 siblings all have another dad. We had very different childhoods, they basically grew up with a real family while I grew up in a split up family since 4 years old with an alcoholic dad who would always have parties with his bum ass friends when I was there every other weekend for pretty much my whole life up until I cut contact with him in my early teens. I have my mom who tries to help me and give me advice and I listen but I always leave with more questions than when I came and no answers. I live totally alone and 90% of my neighbors wont even make eye contact with me even though I try to be outgoing. I have 1 guy online Im very good friends with but he just doesnt understand my lifestyle at all and cant help me or give me any advice. The only friend in my life has nothing else to say except ""Sorry man I really wish I could help you"" every single time that I try to make him see I need help. Low-key crying out for help on social medias almost daily but theres not a single person who gives a fuck. Not one. Ive started doing xans heavily and they make me feel absolutley amazing because I have no stress about anything. I keep popping them as soon as the effects wear off and deep down Im just wishing they would kill me already. Ive tried getting a meeting to see a psychologist but I missed both appointments I had due to no sleep and honestly not even caring about going. I know all the steps I have to take to improve my life but I cant do it. I just cant. I havent been to school in 2 weeks. I havent applied for my welfare check so I dont even know how Ill get money for rent this month. I go to bed at 6-8 in the morning. I barely eat. I dont cook anymore. I dont shower. I dont even brush my fucking teeth. This all started after my breakup although Ive had alot of these slumps in the past.I had a girlfriend. She was my best friend and my true love. The most sweet, caring, supportive and understanding girlfriend any man could wish for. She would put her whole life on hold without a second thought whenever I needed her and I tried my best to do the same for her. We went through so much bullshit together when we were both at our absolute lowest point in life and we helped each other every single day. Her family would constantly treat her like absolute shit, I'm talking shit like her mother telling my girl she is completely worthless in her mothers eyes if my girl would commit suicide when she was heavily depressed. My friends would always take their insecurities out on me by ridiculing me and trying to bring me down for wanting to do something with my life while they only wasted theirs. None of that shit phased us because we had each other and that was all we needed. I motivated her to get her drivers license and education and a job and I was so happy for her. I finally helped her become the grown woman I always wanted to see her as. I wanted to marry her and made plans of how I could get to a point in life where I could settle down with her and start a family together. Her life improved but... mine, not so much. Atleast not enough for her apparently. So she left me. She said that I'm holding her back. Im guessing she saw me going self-destruct mode once again and simply didnt care enough anymore to make an effort to help me. She put herself first and she fixed her life. I cant be mad at her for that. I still think about her every single day and occasionally check if she has unblocked me yet. Now she's living good but Im more miserable than I have ever been in my life. I cant get our last conversation out of my head. She finally told me she loved me again for the first time in probably a month before we broke up. She kept saying, ""I hope one day we will see each other again"" over and over and over like leaving was the last thing she ever wanted to do. Yet she did. The breakup was very respectful and mutual and we wished each other the best even though all I wanted to do was scream until my lunges collapsed. The one and only person who understood me and helped me through this hellhole of a fucking life is now gone. The one I searched all my life to find and now she's gone. She seems unsure of how she wants our current relation to be and to be honest thats the only reason Im still here. Waiting, hoping. What I think is funny is how she left the one who gave her everything he could and instead turned to her family who has done nothing put her down and make her feel worthless her whole life. We have no contact anymore as she blocked me but she keeps showing me support with my music making. I know she still thinks about me and that all just makes it worse. Im not the kind of man who cries, rarely ever. Once per year if even that, not even in my slumps do I cry. But now Ive cried probably 20 times in 2 weeks. Ive smashed my entire apartment up in rage fit which will cost me alot of money when I move out of here but thats the least of my worries right now. Waking up to an apartment that looks like someone broke into and smashed it everyday affects me heavily psychologically and I dont have it in me anymore to soldier up. I just wanna stay in bed and forget all of this constant pain. I used to be filled with testosterone and confidence about everything I did. I thought deep about my life and made the right choices. Now all I make is the wrong choices. I got 900 bucks this month for a 3 month job I did in the summer. Thats already all gone. Spent it on xanax and weed and ready-to-eat food. I feel like a teenager again just struggling to see any reason at all to keep going. I want to end my life so badly but Im scared of dying. I have visions of myself laying dead in my bathtub soaked in my own blood being found by the only people who love me and I would never wish that upon my worst enemy, much less the only ones who care about me. I cut myself really deep recently and my old online friends saw it and didnt really care that much. Never asked if I was ok or if I needed to talk. They were too busy smoking weed and gaming. It feels like Im dangerously close to just slitting my throat next time I lose control of myself due to these anger issues I have. Ive researched ways to kill yourself painlessly but Im not ready to do that. I want it to be fast and over with.Every single day is the exact same repeat. Wake up, avoid thinking about life, sigh, go back to sleep. Wake up a few hours later, check my phone to see 1000 missed calls and messages related to appointments and meetings and I just click them all away without checking them, go back to sleep. Eventually my stomach grumbles violently and Im forced to get the fuck out of bed and go buy some sandwitches or some shit. Come back home, take drugs, make music, feel like everything is perfect while my entire fucking world crashes and burns around me.I dont have fuck all left to live for. I dont have a single person in my life to tell me that what Im doing is meaningful and that I can do anything I put my mind to. Im completely alone in this journey of life and I just cant handle that.Not to sound like a complete asshole here but please save your ""You can always message me"" comments. I struggle to even keep myself together and stay in touch with my family, much less complete strangers online. Honestly I dont even know why Im posting this. Im not expecting any good advice because whenever Ive asked for advice Ive only been told shit I already know or it ends with ""Sorry, cant help ya"". I guess Im here because theres nowhere else to turn.Thanks i guess.","1"
"This isnt fair. Im 22, and I feel like I can probably have a happy, normal life but Im in a constant state of discomfort and disgust with myself. I cant even walk across my own universitys campus without an intense feeling of anxiety and self-consciousness. After outing myself last year to my now-ex, who then outed me to some of her friends, and destroying our relationship, Im still terrified to pursue transition. I have complete respect for everyone who does, but Im not strong enough to do this. I have support from some family and friends, but I dont want being trans to be all Im about. I want to be seen and treated as a woman, for better or worse. I wanted to cry at the table yesterday, because last thanksgiving I hoped I would at least be somewhere by now but I still get overwhelmed at thought of leaving my room in womens clothing.I just want to know what my childhood wouldve been like. I want to know what being a girlfriend, wife, sister, and daughter feels. But this giant asterisk will follow me until I die, and Im scared that itll be soon. I think about dying at least a couple times a week. I dont want to all the time. I feel like Im doing an ok job at keeping busy with school and work, but when depression or dysphoria hits, it hits like a train. I hate this.","1"

"I've just gone through a break up. We've been together for just over 3 and a half years. She was the first person I came out to as bisexual, or at least having feelings for both men and women sexually. She was the first person I came out to as being sexually assaulted as a child. I identified as a strait male my entire life. And with her i felt it. However, I was toxic. I always ran away and led her to believe I was fooling around. That was not the case.I've recently started therapy to try and deal with a long undiagnosed depression. I've begun to show improvements.

"To simplify things, I've been suicidal since I was around eleven or twelve years old. However, only late last year had I decided to make concrete plans to commit suicide within the next few months.The reason I'm suicidal is essentially because of the agony and grief caused by an intense, rather unexpected loss in my life and also because I don't have and can't see anything in life to do that would bring me enough happiness to outweigh the constant sorrow I feel even while doing things I enjoy and consider meaningful.I've tried CBT, I've tried self-help I have a good and diverse and caring support network, I have multiple interests, I've tried lifestyle changes, I've tried exercise, I've tried meditation, I've tried reading philosophy, I've tried Zoloft, I'm currently trying Venlafaxine/Effexor, I've kept an open mind. I haven't tried DBT, although I don't have problems with acceptance/mindfulness/emotional regulation/self-harm and I only have a diagnosis of depression. I am just not quite sure what there is to do at this point. I'm doing everything I want+can do with my life and I still constantly want to die even when I'm in a good or relaxed mood. Should I try electroshock? Magnetic stimulation? Homeopathy? I don't have insurance and I'm not wealthy and neither is my family, so I don't even know if I can afford those things.","1"
"Things are messed up right now. That's an understatement. One of my best friends has been getting close with my other best friends girlfriend. They were BFFs a few days ago. He had been talking inappropriately with her which he didn't realize until it was too late. He had been warned before but I guess it wasn't very thorough. He doesn't have feelings for her. He just really valued their friendship. They clicked really well, shared dark pasts, connected well, etc. She made him feel safe like a sister. Her boyfriend was perfectly fine with things but find out he was too friendly via text and during a near-breakup he got mad at her boyfriend because her boyfriend put all the blame in the relationship on her and she kept going to my friend for advice and someone to talk to. He took her side and bad mouthed her boyfriend to her. Everything got bad. Her boyfriend became worried when I told him he was self harming himself and he called making sure everything was alright. He felt a little better, he was scared to lose them both. I'm the only one here for him. Now, she's blocked him on everything. He feels betrayed. They've shared a lot of inside jokes, talked about how she would be an aunt to his kids someday, praised his music and said she would be his no. 1 fan, wanted to go on double dates, etc. I could tell the friendship meant a lot to him. The four of us are a pretty close circle. We're like a family. He tells me everything and he thinks of her like a sister. He's been alone most of his life, bullied and never had many friends besides us. She was pretty similar. I think they bonded over all that. He never found her attractive or looked at her in that way. He just wants to stay friends. He wanted to fix his friendship with them both. He's been friends with her boyfriend for nearly ten years and her boyfriend introduced him to me. That's how the three of us guys met. We have history. Now that's she's blocked my best friend though, he wants to kill himself. He said that he doesn't know if he can get over how betrayed and lied to he feels. He trusted her and opened up to her and she wanted him to feel like he could tell her anything. Then this happened. I don't want to lose him. But I have been having trouble helping him. He keeps talking about all the memories we've all shared together. He's a long distance friend. Flew him out a few weeks ago. We all mean the world to him and I alone aren't enough. He wants us all and the friendship back. We all mean everything to him. He hates himself. He says he's worthless, stupid and the guilt is eating him alive. He keeps saying he wants to go back in time and stop himself from saying the things he said to her so that everything would be okay.I guess, he feels like his life is over with everything this way. I'm still her friend, her boyfriends friend and my best friends friend. But all he has is me, and hopefully her boyfriend will forgive him. How is anything going to be okay if she keeps him blocked while on good terms with me and her boyfriend? That is if I can prevent my best friends suicide? Our entire family is all fucked up and he might kill himself over it. He was gonna fly back in Summer. Now What? Do we have to hide him from Her? Again, if he isn't dead by then!","1"

"20 Male and married. This is a throwaway because I'm ashamed that I'm even like this but I just want to say these last few things before I go. Not to mention I don't want anyone to know the real reasons why I did this as to make it easier on the people around me. I recently got married happiest day of my life away from my negative and ruling parents had a women I thought I loved and two beautiful daughters. Time has flown by but every day seems to continuously get harder and today was the final straw. A few weeks ago My wife was cheating on me. I chose to forgive but I could not forget. Few weeks later she leaves saying she's going to the gym, me trying to be supportive and not trouble her with my paranoia and dwindling mental stability, I acknowledge and keep my insanity to myself. Eventually I break she's gone and I can't control myself and I check her location on Snapchat (the entire time we've been married I've only went through her phone once, the time she was cheating.) I saw that she was not at the gym and was rather at a street address. I'm familiar with the area so I know it's residential. I call and call and no response finally get ahold of her and she tells me she is at the gym finally I confront her and get the truth from her. I explained that she lied to me and it's worse because she has already broken my trust once. She doesn't seem to understand she seems to get upset that I'm constantly paranoid despite constantly trying to hide it from her. Yesterday thanksgiving night her male friend calls her and she rushes up the stairs but not before I grab the phone and hand it to her. Again my trust is destroyed and I can't believe a word she says what makes it worse is that we are at her brother 6 hours away from home. When I get home I want to end it all I'm tired of constantly judging her and having these thoughts of her because what if she isn't cheating what if my insanity is ruining the best thing that could happen to me I'd rather kill myself and leave them in my will. I can't control the thoughts that run through my mind it's constant and debilitating and I all I want is for them to stop for good and my wife to be happy, with or without me. ","1"

"That everyone who tries to help you, just drives you further into a grave. I hate myself and I don't think my life is worth anything. I go to help lines and chat lines and the conversation gets cut short because they don't know how to deal with me or because their one breathing exercise that they all use doesn't work for me, or they think if I say/type everything I feel it'll make me not want to die. Before you say try this line, or try again, this has happened 20 times, I'm good. I wish that was an exaggeration.Or worse, when you tell someone you think is a friend that you want to die. It's not their fault all they know to say is that they're sorry and they wish it weren't that way. But I can deal without the promises to be there for me and that they'll talk to me the next day, because anywhere from weeks to months to a year passes by when I have to initiate the conversation and they act like I never had a problem. I can do without the attitude or defensiveness when I give you the out of saying that you don't have to make that promise, and you stick to your guns. Leaving my idiot self to sit here thinking that any day my phone is going to ring and I'm ring to talk to someone. I can do without the barrage of generic phrases like""it gets better"" or ""hang in there"" or ""you're going to be happy soon"" because if you believed that why would you avoid me and my life. Why when I tell someone that someone else said all of those generic things, then turned around and told me that they didn't care about me or if I killed myself then proceeded not to talk to me again, that you call them idiots then essentially do the same thing? You're not just proving them right, you're proving me right. Then you continue the cycle of going from stranger to ""friends' to stranger and rant to the void that is the internet only to realize that none of it matters. You can get a bunch f messages saying ""I care"" you can talk, you can spill your guts and then you can say you feel better and leave. You can also lie and die later. Because that's what someone broken does. They don't respond well to breathing techniques and generic sayings and fake promises don't bring hope. All this crap that seems to work on everyone else that you get in yet another pamphlet about depression and suicidal thoughts means nothing anymore. All the games they make you play to trick you into saying that you care abut something, you still manage to lose. hen someone asks what's the one thing that matters to you, you literally can't think anything. All the help is just confirmation. fuel to fire. So you stay silent. At least, you're mouth doesn't move. But you're mind is buzzing with loud voices reminding you of the option that's most permanent. So you think of your friends like everyone tells you, and you side with the voices.","1"
"In April I've decided this is my last year. The closer the year got to an end the more I believe it. I'm not going to talk about why, no point. I guess I just needed to let someone know. I have what I need now it's just about where. Just know, I don't want this. I can't change this. I have tried getting help, been diagnosed with multiple things. It's just made it all worse knowing I'm stuck with this feeling until I die. There's no point in continuing.","1"
"I got anhedonia from PT-141.Im convinced that my life is over since this isnt going away. No amount of CBT or mindfulness is getting rid of it.I think I suffered a tragedy of this kind to have a peptide induce this hell. Every day I am constantly obsessing about what this did to me. And the thing is going to therapy or mindfulness does not help because it does not change how I feel. The MOST important thing is FEELINGS. I feel this way and have been since I did the peptide therefore it did something to me else I would not be feeling like this. Its simply not possible to get this anhedonia out of the blue. I cannot believe what has happened to me.Also CBT just is not kicking in. They say do behavioral activation and I try but the thing is its not actually having an effect on my symptoms. I still have to deal with this after said behavior. So I get obsessed do I need to do this 1,000,000 times or 100,000,000 times or 9999999.67822 times to achieve the cure? I understand there is no set time frame but im not patient enough and I just want to commit suicide since the wait and effort to cure this is too much","1"
"My life is going down hill. I don't know what to do. No one gives a shit about me and the last time i tried to reach out for help and call a prevention hotline, i got locked up in a psychiatric ward with a bunch of teenage girls (im a male). I'm so fucking depressed and I don't feel like I can go on in life. I just want to be wanted and loved. I feel like a drain on society. I started taking some meds but they didnt help at all. I might go jump off a bridge. There is no hope. All i can do is piss all my friends off and be a burdon on everyone around me.","1"
"I'm 22, F, and for as long as I can remember, I have thought about killing myself.(Currently drinking, please excuse any and all spelling mistakes)I always thought having suicidal thoughts and tedencies was normal, because of the people I hung out with, but as I got older, I realise that is no longer the case.I've been on and off medication for about a year and a bit, ad the first batch on meds I was on, was the worst thing ever (sertralie 50mg), I took that for about 6 months on an off, just to have a bit of normalcy in my lif. Recently, I've been put on a lower dose (Citalopram 20mg) which has started out great. I didn't feel like a zobie, i didn't feel weak walking, or even sitting up. I could keep food down. I felt like a normal huan being. That was about 5 weeks ago. I've always been suicidal, from a very young age, but I never told my family about it. Now that my family knws about it, they keep sayibg I have no reason to feel or be suicidal, just like m=I have no reason to be depressed. I took a day off from work today, and I got told, I'm throwing everyone in the shit for today, which ust piled on to how I was feeling.I'm currently drining wine, and may drink another bottle, and see if I am coscious enough to take some pills. Ive never really used this place, but it seemed like a good place to just kind f let things go. I dont expect any sort or form of response on this. I guess I just wanted to see if it would get posted or whatever.I apologise if this was a wste of time. But I feel like a waste of space.Thank you to anyone who took the time to read this. I always thought I'd join the 27 club, but I'm not famous enough for it, but I've got a drug habit anyway that I' not proud of.Thank you.I love you, stranger","1"
"I'm expecting legal difficulties soon. I got myself involved in something I shouldn't have, and I'd prefer to leave it at that. I am 1 year out from my bachelor's in engineering and I know for sure this is going to get me expelled. I'll be labeled a felon and never be allowed to work anywhere real, let alone finish my education.It'll humiliate both me and my parents. If it weren't for them and Zoloft, I'd be long gone. But I now see suicide as a way to get out of this. I have long wanted to die, this seems like the time.I'm not sure what I expect out of this, but if it weren't against the rules, I fully expect you'd agree with me.","1"
"She showed alot of the signs in the past few days/weeks (cutting people out, telling me she didn't know how to get over it, getting off of social media) and while I didn't think she'd hurt herself tonight I didn't want to risk it, I know she's tried to before. She told me not to come over and I was going to let her have her space but then she texted she wanted to cut everything out  and then she stopped responding to me for an hour of me asking her to just tell me she was ok. I told her I would come over if she didn't respond but now I feel like an idiot who overeacted.   I've never been close to someone this depressed and this ready to cut people out of their life so I just wanted to overeacted rather than an underreact. It honestly freaked me out because I didn't want to be one of those people who thought she wouldn't do it and then it happens. Now, though, I'm just sitting downstairs from her in her house feeling like an idiot and she's mad at me.I don't know what to do, I honestly feel like I have no clue what I'm doing and I don't want to lose the is friendship and I most definitely don't want to distance her and then her really be alone and the worst happens. Any advice is welcome, thanks guys. UPDATE: She seems more relaxed now. I was just sitting downstairs in her house finishing a remote work shift (only way she let me inside) and I was planning on leaving but she subtly (not outright) asked me to stay and finish an assignment that I had told her about as it would ""make her feel better."" At least she's out of her own head. I'm still giving her her distance, of course.","1"
"It happened 2.5 years ago. Back story: I was diagnosed with ADHD(how original) 6 years ago while i was in Uni. Since that day started to use my ""serious"" medicines. It was short and long release adheral like medicines. I haven't been fine for last 6 years. Almost every week thought of doing it. But every time my written DNA forced me to remember how many people would be affected. And than one night popped some long release pills. Grabbed hand full and swallowed washed them down with some beer. It was at night time. You know how i did it? I tricked my brain to it was just a ""drug that would not kill me"". Pills started kick in my heart was pounding hands were shaking. But best thing was ideas were coming and going soo fast. Like in the movie limitless. Tried to calm my self to sleep but no it wasn't possible. In the morning went to local hospital were our family doctors was working. She saw me and said "" what did you do"" i told her everything. She was trying to call an ambulance. But i didn't want it. I was really clear and confident. Told her that my friends were waiting outside. They were going to take me to hospital. There wasn't any friends. I don't know why but I called my abusive gf. She panicked and put me into taxi and we went to emergency service. They washed my stomach and nothing happened of course it was 8 hours ago. Also made me drink apple juice with coal inside. Told doctors that i took only 3 pills there wasn't anything big. Asked them to write rapport to work that says food poisoning and they did. I know it all sounds fake and fiction but where i live this things can happen easily. Noone wants to do their jobs so you can manipulate them to choose easier way to do it. And than nothing happened no one knew what i did, even myself.At this day i realized i really tried suicide. But you know what nothing has changed I am still a misfit that don't gets the purpose of so many things. I wrote this thing to remind my self and share with all of you. P.s: I am not a native speaker, so please excuse my writing and structure of it. I know it sucks :)","1"
"How do I start? I am a 32 year old male. I was born sterile and engaged twice. I am struggling to find a reason to continue.  I was emotionally abused and sexually assaulted when I was young. Intimacy and social interactions are still difficult for me to handle. Most of my friends have settled down, moved away or deployed with the military. It makes it hard to vent with someone as a result.  I don't leave my house except to go to work and grocery shop. Career wise, I am stuck in this area because of debt and taking care of my grandparents. But my career is a major part of my depression. I have worked at the same company for 11 years. My pay has only increased 5 % since I started.  My cousin whom I am close to is 27, has 5 kids and never went to college. He makes double the money. I envy him because he is making a good living and is able to have kids naturally.  I feel like an outcast at family functions. No one talks to me or seems to notice when I leave. At this point it makes not want to attend them.  I've done everything right in my life. I have never done drugs. I drink 5 times a year. My grades were great in college. Everyone is surpassing me in life. It has always felt this way. Lately, I have been trying to find a new way to live or improve myself. The fight in me is gone. Everyday, it gets hard to carry on.  I read back on my words and feel like I am coming off petty. It is not my intent.","1"

I regulary asked him how he feels and today he told be that he wants to kill himself after his parents are gone [he is a minor]. I dont know any personal details from him besides his steam, discord and instagram account.

No hobbies and I struggle to find interest in anything aside from sleeping.

"I want to kill myself but I never do. I almost did once, but my husband took the gun away from me. I have Borderline Personality Disorder and Type II Bipolar Disorder. Type II means I don't get mania, I get hypomania, the less fun one. I spend most of my time depressed, though. The BPD makes it worse. I don't feel like I deserve help - I'm getting therapy and meds from a non-profit mental health place, where I found out I don't need help. I don't do drugs, I'm not an alcoholic, I own a car, I've always been able to hold down a job, and I'm working on getting my B.A. with two majors and a minor with a 3.78 GPA. Also, married to a guy who's basically perfect.Describing myself, I sound like someone who shouldn't be hoping for death. Yet I do. I fuck shit up. Husband is sad? I find a way to make it worse. Money problems? It's all about me. Today we went grocery shopping and ended up with $82 for food because my husband didn't work one day due to being sick. Didn't find this out until we were paying for the food. My husband unloaded the cart and put all my food, even my freaking ice cream, on the belt. He has two dinners for the next ten days of work! But apparently my ice cream is more important because if I don't have a reward system, I won't be able to successfully continue watching my calories. We're poor and have been living with his mom since we got married two years ago. His mom initially didn't like me cause I'm white, then I worked to establish a good relationship with her. When the engagement came about she told my husband she actually didn't like me at all, she was only pretending because she figured we'd break up eventually and she wouldn't have to put up with me any longer. Then she proceeded to be emotionally abusive while believing I was the one causing all the problems. She told me her family had been happier before I came along. My husband took away my gun cause I was suicidal. After getting back on meds this summer he gave it back because I was doing better. His mom said he shouldn't give it back because I'll just shoot myself. So no matter how much I wanna die, I can't do it with my gun because his mom will absolutely tell him ""I told you so.""I'm not sure why I'm posting this shit. I guess I need an outlet. I always go t Facebook first, but I don't post there anymore because people kept telling me my attitude was the reason for me being sad or I shouldn't be opening up so much on social media or some other bullshit. Anyway, tonight I really wanna cry, feel alone (cause I fucking deserve things to be awful) and die. Being alive is just too fucking stressful. I can't keep this shit up.","1"
"Hello. I've been feeling suicidal for quite a while now, and these feelings are mostly tied to a somatic condition of mine. I've gone to the shrink (a couple of different ones) every week as per my appointments, and I try to listen when people say it helps, but it really doesn't. Going to therapy honestly feels like a waste of time, where the focus is entirely on talking about my feelings but with no measures to actually fix anything. That's especially hard since my condition isn't fixable. I'm kinda feeling out of options, and suicide is becoming more and more of an inevitability.I feel like I've tried and tried to make things better to the extent that I can, but it just keeps getting worse, and I've given up on trying. Don't know why I'm writing this, since I don't really believe in this motivational-cirklejerk-kinda thing that is online support groups, but whatever. I took an extra sleeping pill and felt abit emotional.","1"
"I tried committing suicide last night. I went to wal mart, grabbed some donut holes, orange juice, found some tubbing for a wash machine, and shipping tape. I parked somewhere no one could find me and I hooked eveything up to the exaust and just sat there in my car. After about five minutes I started getting really dizzy. My ex started calling and I opened my window and answered. Why does one person have so much power over me, I wonder. I've been through a lot of shit in 2017.. I'm not saying I'm worst off than everyone else.. I just feel stuck in this swamp of depression. I can't hold a job, and my mom can barely pay the bills. I'm 24 and I'm suppose to be a man, I should be paying the bills for her but instead I'm just trying to get high on anything I can get a hold on. My ex got pregnant 7 months ago.. I was so excited to have a family. I had this fire and sense of excitement that I knew I was going to do eveything physically and mentally possible to do what had to be done for my family. She ended up changing her mind and I paid for an abortion for her. She dumped me 2 days later and has been sleeping with other dudes since then. I hate depending on people but I can't stop trying to get a hold of her. I'm actually with her right now but I feel like she's only her cause she knows how bad of shape I am in. She's about to go clubbing with a bunch of dudes and especially with one that she told me she slept with recently. My family isn't very supportative. I've begged for help and I went to a hospital but I don't like it. I just feel even more depressed. I just want to stop feeing this way guys. I was so happy a year ago and now I feel like I can't even look myself in the mirror.. I've lost like 20 pounds in 2 weeks cause I'm just getting worst and worst. I'm about to go home from my exs and I know I'm just going to sit there and be bored and have nothing to do but be depressed. My parents just got a divorce recently, my dog died, and I'm just lonely..Sorry for the way I explain things and my English.

"This is my first time posting on here my boyfriend of almost 3 years basically kill himself about a month and some days ago. He was an alcholic but was the best person ever! We had our downs and there were alot. He was my best friend. This past April we had broken up because things got really bad, i mean like abusive. I was so mad at him for anything drinking and i pushed him constantly about it. It ended up being he hit me and i hit him back sorta. But I was so messed up becaue i didn't know what to do to help, so I had started to self harm again. The thing is I loved him. But when we broke up for like 2 weeks, i slept with someone and he never admitted it but his friends did. We had sorta agreed on sleeping with whoever but coming home to each other. That didn't really work becaue i became so jealous he too. But this last month July I mean, he was off of work. And had time to drink and hang out and i was jealous I couldn't get off at all. But after a week or so. I accepted it and we got good again! I thought it was weird tbat we stopped arguing but i was happy, i thought he was too. He had slowed drinking tremendously and i was so happy but the moment he said he was drinking I got mad and didn't talk to him until the next day. And that's exactly what happened. I didn't come that night and i could have stopped him, he was so mad i didn't come over that night. I had my daughtar and i couldn't she was sleeping already. Not to mention he was drunk so drunk he was slurring his words. I thought this was like any other time he had been completely smashed. It turns out it wasn't. He descied to try and hang himself. I saw him for maybe 10 mins on video chat but he was so drunk. I got irritated but then tried to change his mind ftom being upset to something else. But I had fallen asleep thinking he was sleeping but he hanged himself while i slept. I was the one who found him the next day, i woke up in a panic becsue I felt that he had tried to hurt himself. So I hurried with my things and got thete. It was terrible. I couldn't imagine what was happening. I feel so broken. I've tried to get mediums to talk to him and i feel like that's just wasted money. I just I just want him back. I have no idea what to do without him. I don't want to be alone and very much contemplated leaving. Bit I can't i have a 3 year old who needs me, but I find it hard to even be there for her. I can't pray, i can't accept this. I feel lile a hole is in my heart, i lilterally feep pain. I just want him back. It's not fair. He was so good, me and him brought the worst of each other but also the best! I miss him so much and i don't know what to do. How I place in his family, how to go over there, how to do anything. I'm so miserable and im placing tbis mask on and it's tetribke. I know he had problems but i wish I could have stopped myself ftom getting mad everytime I heard him say he was drinking.  I hate this so much! It's been 4 months now and i still don't want to be here, i got a dui the other day. This last month I've been trying to see what the fun in drinking is and I've fucked up. I'm ruining my life staying alive. I'm ruining my daughter's life too. I hate my family so much besides the twins and my daughtar. I want everything to be ok But it's not. Yesterday I tried to kill myself but i couldn't, I'm too scared. I keep making mistake after mistake. Nothing is going right. I miss him so much it feels like just yesterday he was here and all I want is for him to be here witg me. I was not worth staying, no one stays. He was the 1st person I truly fought for and he left me. I don't wanna be here I hate it, i just don't have the guts to kill myself. I'm so pathetic. I'm mad and sad and i don't even know if i die will i see him? There's no answer no solace, I'm so stuck and it's breaking me. I want help but i cant get it bc my ex will try to take my daughtar. She sees me and wants me and i don't know what to do. I'm so lost, i hate this. I hate him but i love him. I'm so broken and i can't be fixrd. I hate it. I just cry and it makes nothing better. I don't want to talk I just want him yo come back and help me. That's all. And I can help him. But he's too happy in heaven and i hate asking him back and kniw it's never happening but i truly wish him back. ","1"

"So, first off, I don't know why I'm even posting this.  I guess I just feel like I need to tell someone, even though it won't really change anything.  Last night I overdosed on benadryl and slit my wrists.  I proceeded to pass out.  The cuts on my wrists weren't very deep so I didn't loose much blood.  I went in and out of consciousness all night, but I woke up in the morning (this morning).  I was so upset I woke up.  I didn't think I'd ever have to wake up again.  When I first felt the medicine start to kick in I panicked.  But then a calm swept over me and I just accepted it.  It was so peaceful.  I felt like I was going home.  And I know that's bad.  I know that my mind isn't suppose to think like that, but it does.  And the scariest thing is, I want to try again.  I'm at such a loss for what to do.  (side note, not a single person knows about my depression, anxiety, cutting, or this attempt.  I've never been to a doctor or talked to anyone about this because I'm alone and I don't want to be a burden to anyone.  I also know how disappointed my family would be if they found out.)

"So I have been depressed for 13 years. I have been going through therapy for 5 years. I have a hard time connecting with people which makes ""friends"" only stay for a month or so and then somewhat disappear. I have been thinking a lot about suicide and I struggle with extreme anxiety. I have tried using hobbies to scilence that little voice that is always telling me to end it all. I also tried being in a relationship to make the voice go away, it somewhat worked temporarily because I started to only care about them instead of me. Now the voice have grown stronger by the years that had passed by. I'm not even sure what I am doing right now. I tried to hang myself a month ago without success. I then tried to help myself by being creative and put everything I make on my wall. I thought that I either going to feel better because that I made something or otherwise my family will have something when I am gone. I don't know..I was thinking about killing myself yesterday and today but I didn't.. I'm not sure what I wanted with this post. I felt like a wanted to vent and be able to say that even though I have tried my best and my life situation as improved a lot, my depression is still the same and my motivation of living becomes less for each year that is passing by.","1"

"tldr: was supposed to be about how I want to kill.myself, but never have the motivation to and when I went through with it, something always happened. Instead it's how I hate my family because they're abusive? I've tried it before, went through with it. It was only something stupid, like the rope untying itself or the shelf breaking.All my family does is yell. Whenever something goes wrong, it's all my fault. My brother gets caught for smoking weed? Let's blame me for not telling you guys that he was smoking. My sister making a mess? Let's blame me for not cleaning up after her? Either you or my dad does something wrong? Well it's my fault I didn't stop you guys. I can't handle anyone raising their voice at me, because that's not associated with cry harder so you won't get beat as hard. My mom would show a bunch of shows where the step-mother was evil and whenever she wanted to scare us, she'd threaten us by saying ""don't make me turn into the step-mother.""She used to send outside for hours and stand infront of the street having us hold signs that said ""Free Child: Unwanted"". Whenever we complainbed, her response was ""Oh, if you don't like us then just run away or something. You can call the police, they'll take you to a different parents."" and one time I told her I was going to go to my aunt's because she acting loved me. Got my ass beat, because of that.She's gotten less violent as she made more white American friends, because they're nicer to their children. It's just her yelling more emotional damaging stuff. Like whenever we see any family, the first thing she'll do is just speak loud enough to hear how I'm failing all my classes even though my grades are the best they've ever been.All through my childhood, I was called the smart child and now my parents use it to make me feel like shit. ""Why are you failing physics? I thought you loved science."" Ok mom, shut the fuck up. You used bully me because I wanted to be a biologist. ""Oh, that's a white person's job."" Anytime I picked up anything new, you would make fun of me for it till I stopped  doing it. Like I used to do scrap booking with zoo magazines, but then you made fun of me for it being gay. Same with drawing, photography, and now you're doing the same with skateboarding.My dad is more patient and has never been violent. But he's still emotionally abusive. ""Why can you be more like your brother? He has a girlfriend and is athletic."" Ok, I'm sorry you made fun of me everytime I tried working out. ""Wow, you can see all your fat jiggle from a mile away."" I was only ten and sure I was fat, but I was trying to lose. I remember when I broke down at the dinner table because you guys made fun of me for finishing eating before everyone. ""Wow, are you on a diet?"" And after I broke down at the table and told you how I felt at your fat jokes, ""if you cry more, you'll burn a couple calories.""My brother is such an annoying entitled little shit. We're twins, so we've always grown up together. We just happened to get the more athletic build that my dad has. He thinks everything should go his way because he's more athletic. My family will plan a vacation, but he'll throw his little tantrum. ""But that's the day my girlfriend comes back from vacation! I haven't seen her in three days!"" Shut the fuck up, even your girlfriend thinks you'retoo attached. ""What do you mean you won't lend me $10 to buy weed? It doesn't matter you're saving up, that's $10 of $100 you have. That's not so much!"" He can never admit he's wrong either and if he does, I have to be wrong too or the arguement will end in him beating me or him spreading rumors and belittling me infront of everyone in school. When we were younger, in elementary school he got everyone to bully me because I thought his house in Minecraft could use a bit less glowstone. He attacks everything I do too, like he's basically my mom. Even after all that, he'll pretend he's a very supportive brother infront of everyone. ""Yeah, when the cops came to take him to the hospital because he tried to kill himself, I was scared I wasn't ever going to seem him ever again."" No you weren't. You once shouted ""I wish you would kill yourself because everyone finds you annoying as fuck."" Because I didn't let you play the xbox after you had used it all day. My mom blames me suicide attempts on me too. ""Maybe if you weren't stupid you'd have better grades. Stop, doing this to yourself. All your problems are made up and not real. This is just teenage angst. Just stop being so negative and get happy."" I'm not even allowed to cry in my house, because then my mom thinks it's stupid and gay so boys shouldn't cry. Last time I cried, I got my ass beat even though it was over her threatening that she was gonna burn all my records because my brother forgot to do his chores and I didn't do them for him. The last time you beat me was a while back because I painted my nails and it was when I had friends over too. You pulled me into a different room so 'i could help you with something.' and beat me because I had my nails painted again. Then you threatened to do it again if she sawe crying or if my friends found out. ","1"
"My pathetic excuse of a shitty fucking life has actually gotten WORSE than when I was last here. I was studying for a physics test on Sunday and naturally, I was overwhelmed. My parents were checking my bag and found a stash of comics that I didn't even have time to read over the weekend and told me to return the comics to the friend I borrowed it from. I have been diagnosed by my psychiatrist with depression and IED at the age of 10, and I am prone to fits of crying, outbursts of rage, or both at the same time. On Saturday, I had a severe mental breakdown when my mom and sister were watching a movie. I went to her bedroom and cried before suffocating myself with the blanket and pillows. I survived. I did the same thing 4 years ago when I broke the family camera, but my brother stopped me. Twice. Back to Sunday, I had one again and opened up to my parents one last time about my suicidal feelings. It never went over well. Of fucking course they were shocked. But the nail that seals the coffin is that my mom said if I were to talk about killing myself again, she would kill herself for real. My dad threatened to get me kidnapped and tortured. They both said that my psychiatrist wouldn't appreciate me contemplating suicide. Uh, she cares about me more than they ever would! I don't get the whole stigma Asians place on suicide. Once you kill yourself, your family and relatives act like you never existed in the first place.And then, I got my report card yesterday. MY GOD, is it suicide fuel. Here's the marksFrench: 85English: 58Chemistry: 43 (Should've transferred out. Now I know why everyone hates that teacher.)Accounting: 71Physics: 58Math: 68 (What the fuck?! I used to get low-90s in grades 9 and 10! This teacher threw us a fucking curveball!)Gym: 79Family Studies: 84(I took the last two courses to break the monotony of school life.)Avg.: 68 (Can't even go to fucking community college. Guess my decision to kill myself after graduating was for the best.)As you can see, my report card is suicide fuel. And did I tell you I attempted to hang myself using my sister's hammock?Maybe I shouldn't tell anyone. Maybe I should just disappear randomly and say ""I'm going out"", only to have my family find me dead. Even my friends have discouraged me from killing myself, albeit in a nicer way. Well, fuck them too! This place's better off without me!","1"
"this seems like a sure fire way to a painless death. anyone got experience trying to od from a similar combination? im thinking ill take 10 valiums(10mg) in the morning, then take 10 xans and oxy40s both together and maybe even wash it down with some alcohol just to top it off. from what i read ill just end up passing out then dying in my sleep. seems pretty painless","1"
"In the summer my friend tried to kill himself twice, each time I was the one who found him,the first time I was the one who called the ambulance, sped so fast I got to his house in 8minutes when he lives 15 away, I ran into his house, he was lying on the kitchen floor unconscious. We went to the hospital and I didn't leave his side until he was ""safe"" at home again. Two nights later he tried again. I did everything over again but when I got to his house he wasn't in his room he was somewhere in the forest. It was 1am and I was told to go out into the forest and find him. I was crying out his name hoping he would answer but he didn't. When I found him he was up in a tree and when the police arrived they got him down. Again we went to the hospital and I stayed with him as long as I could. I guess I don't need to fill you in on everything that happened but after he got out of the hospital he got upset with me and stopped talking to me. In August he texted me and wanted advice but I didn't say what he wanted to hear and he got mad at me. I couldn't take what he said so I decided to OD, only, the next day I woke up. I've never hated myself more. I wanted everything to go away and I failed. How do you fail at something like this? The next week I was accepted to college across the country so I packed and left. In October another friend killed himself and left me feeling so helpless. Now I'm sitting in front of my laptop and I have no clue what to do. Everything is just really stressful and I am trying to be positive but I was just diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder and everything is piling up. I feel like I'm drowning. I sorry I just need to rant. Sorry. There's more I want to say I just can't do it. ","1"

"Yeah so my life is miserable and has been for years. I have no friends, I hate myself, I'm failing college, I can't stay sober for more than 24 hours, I can't get health insurance to see a therapist or get medication (God bless America), and I'm in so much debt I can't even keep track of it. I owe at least $20,000 in student loans already, $1,500 in credit debt, $1,000 to family, probably more. I'm only 19. I got a soul-sucking call center job for $10/hr and all of my pay goes to pay off debt, so I don't have money for decent food. Probably getting kicked out of where I'm living soon and will be homeless. Failing all of my classes because I'm too depressed to go most of the time and that just makes me hate myself more. I've been going to group therapy every week since that's the only thing I can find that's free but it hasn't done shit for me. So yeah. I guess I have a plan for how I'd do it. But the ironic thing is that a huge part of me wanting to do it is being broke and in debt, but I don't have the money to buy the things I need to commit suicide. Talk about a morbid fucking catch 22","1"

"When I think about all my suicidal thoughts I get a reminder that the first time I contemplated suicide was when I was very young, maybe 9 or 10. It's insane that a kid that young who hasn't cherished life enough is already thinking about death. I wasn't bullied, had a good social life, and education life. I knew I was suicidal because of my mother who has made me extremely insecure. It hurts to know she won't even kiss me or let alone hug me anymore. People who you crave the most attention from sometimes gives you the wrong and the worst attention. I still love you mom, I know you love me too. I'm sad that I wanted to die because I was your child and after all these years I'm still sad. Please talk to me sometime before it's too late.","1"

Death sounds pretty sweet, its like sleeping but you dont ever have to wake up.  I wish someone would kill me so i dont have to look like a selfish pussy but so far no luck with that.

Both my parents are pretty bad people, my father has never known my birthday and hes so racist and cruel that can i cant stand to be around him but since the divorce i know hes been lonely.  Recently he just made the decision to have a child with the woman he cheated on my mother with, this woman hates my brother and I and we were banned from attending their wedding.  I sent him a Happy Thanksgiving texts and I got nothing back.  When my mother heard the news she broke down and i had to babysit her again, both parents are alcoholics but since Ive lived with my mother my whole life Ive had to deal with it since middle school.  My stress levels are so bad that my hair is falling out in clumps.  I live at home and attend online community college and i dont leave my house for weeks at a time.  I just dont want to keep existing anymore, Im sure my friends love me and it will get better but I cant wait that long, I dont want to be here anymore I just cant take it.  I already have a stash of hydrocodone and broken glass that Ive used for self harm.

"There's very little that I have hope in. I've lost my career, my relationship with my family, and respect from just about everyone.  For a long time, every girl I ever loved has left me.  Eventually I met someone better than the rest, unwilling to leave.  Though I was alone while writing most of this letter, in recent years I've been with this person.  She's the best person I could ever expect her to be in any way.  I love her deeply.  She deserves better than what I will be able to provide (physically, mentally, socially) and I will not allow myself to burden her for the rest of her life.  She should not have to carry me, even if she is strong enough.  She should find someone who is truly whole that she can spend her life with.  I will not tear her away to share my nightmare.  There is no future in which I'm happy. I'm painful to be around. I can't stand it.  I feel that by agreeing to take care of me she is inherently neglecting herself to the point her own emotional trauma and eventual mental health problems.  In retrospect, the other partners I've had were reasonable to leave.  They've lived better lives because of it, and I am glad that I have not continued to be a negative influence in their life.  I do not want to condemn anyone else to my own personal hell.  Writing this out at night has been the only way I've been able to get to sleep for a long time.It's been years. Therapy and medication has not helped. Many women that I have loved have moved on.  Continuing to hurt the one who has not seems worse than being alone. I am constantly exploring new rock bottoms.  Anyway, I think I'm done editing. I'm sorry.My note:__________________________________________________This message contains emotionally disturbing information and may be deleted or left unread however the receiver prefers.Places and days in which this was written: (<<<remove this eventually>>>)October 9, 2012 12:41am, Nov 23, 2013. 3:11am, Jan 8, 2014 4:59 am, November 24, 2017 1:27 amThis email has been 'delay sent' 14 days after my death, so there's no need to urgently call 911. To be clear this is unfortunately a suicide note.I'm sorry to inform you all that I've decided to kill myself. For those of you aware that I've been struggling I'm sorry. I know this is not the solution that you would have wanted, but please take comfort in the fact that I am not suffering anymore, if you can, and I know that will be extremely difficult. Many of our relationships were strained. Please accept this as the result of my disease and not a lessening of my love for you. I know you would have done anything to stop this, and we've tried a lot together to stop this. I'm the one who gave up.  I know these words don't really help.  I'm completely convinced that you're better off without me as a negative drain in your life.  I know that doesn't help either, and I know it's supposedly common for people in my position to incorrectly think that. I'm sorry.  It's my wish that you process, grieve, and move on with your life in whatever way you desire. That is, if I'm entitled to wishes, which I doubt.For those of you unaware that I've been feeling this poorly, I'm sorry. I've enjoyed your friendship, and if I didn't tell you about this it wasn't because I didn't think we were close. Everyone needs to feel normal. I do not like to think how much worse things would have been without you. I know that you would have liked to help. I know that this is not alright. I've been urgently concerned about this problem for a long time and have done as much as I could for as long as I could to fix it.To everyone: Please do not interpret this event as your fault. I am specifically telling you all that this is not your fault. Again, as clearly as possible: this is not your fault. You would not blame yourself if I died of cancer. Do not blame yourself for this, please. This was my own random disease, many professionals have been helping me but unfortunately unsuccessfully. It is not their fault either. There are limits to what can be fixed.  At some point mental illness stops modifying one's personality and instead becomes it.  More than that it becomes your destiny (to suffer).  When I was younger this didn't seem to be an issue.  Somewhere in my mid 20's this problem appeared and has not gone away despite my best efforts with clinicians, self help books, medication, family support, travel, job changes, career changes, geographic relocation, etc.  I haven't always tried to make it better, but I've tried as hard as I could for as long as I could.  I am the one giving up.  At some point even people close to you stop associating your depression with a condition / disorder and start attributing it to your personality.  They begin to treat you differently...to bully you...ignore you...etc.  It's normal, they're being normal and it's not they're fault.  You're trapped in your own body as you slowly become a social pariah.  The more people you tell the further along they begin the progression towards considering you permanently deficient / broken as a person.  Personally I've found the less I share with non-professionals the better.  That being said, I am the one giving up, it's not anyone else's fault -- they are behaving as normal people -- the way I would have behaved before having these problems.  It's often weird to think of how I used to be confused by suicidal people.  I would wonder how anyone could ever think that.  Over time I've gotten very used to feeling differently.    To be as clear as possible: I'm the one who is giving up. This is my fault. I'm smart enough to do this without anyone stopping me or knowing about it in advance. You all know this. It is not your fault. There were intentionally no hints. You've all been very supportive before and after I started experiencing the symptoms that would eventually cost me my life. There's nothing equal to the love and compassion you've shown me, and I deeply regret the effect this will have on you. So I'm sorry. I've unfortunately agonized very long about this. To be absolutely clear, there's no good way to do this and it's a terrible decision.  It doesn't solve anything and it's not right for anyone, including me, I know. This is my fault. I though about trying to make it look natural, but it seemed worse to try to fool you.So the truthful way was the way to do it. By ""truthful"" I mean letting you know what I did. I killed myself.Again, I am sorry. I love you all, and many others that I did not send this note to directly because I felt like it would have a net negative impact. But everyone was as supportive as I could reasonably expect them to be.  I know the best way to help is not to do this and to get better. I have tried that for as long as I could.There's just pain.  Life is often like a very bad dream.  That's all I feel the need to say.  But: I've read that people often struggle with the question of ""why?."" It may make more sense to you if I explain that I have not been happy or productive for long time. Everything I loved has lost its meaning - poisoned by the negativity in my head. Everything hurts. Every memory, every connection I make. And I make a lot of connections. My head physically hurts.  I'm ready to stop hurting.   If this seems ridiculous consider that you very likely have an image of me that is dated and does not reflect the person that I have unfortunately become. Those of you closer to me may have noticed more readily. I've often tried to put on a strong face and act better than I felt for the sake if getting better.There's really no way to explain any of this to anyone.Any same person would pick up this letter and find it instantly wrong. You may be thinking that this was a waste. That I just needed to wait for things to improve. You may have been right. I have held out as long as I could. Surely if it's possible for things to get better, it's also possible for them to get worse. As time has passed, the radius of people hurt expands.  There are an increasing number of people for whom I'm unable to provide.  As time goes on I hurt more people more deeply.  I wouldn't want to meet the person I will become in 10 or 20 years.  I won't live through the nightmares between then and now.  Already I will be hurting more people now than if I had done this earlier.  One may argue that death is the worst possible condition, but that is not true. You don't know the anger that I've felt - the useless, bitter, completely controlling hatred. Hurting the people you love is certainly worse than death.  But, you might say ""by killing yourself you are hurting them more than you possibly could any other way.""  Well...eventually you see yourself hurting the people you love and you stop feeling anything except your own pain.  When the flames are bad enough you jump, regardless of how bad the fall is.  I'm sorry.  It seems like the longer I hold out the more people I hurt...I tried. Not for myself.  I absolutely would not have endured this amount of pain for myself. Not for a week. Again, I am sorry. It's my wish that you process, grieve, and move on with your life in whatever way you desire. And, again, there's nothing equal to the love and compassion you've shown me, and I deeply regret the effect this will have on you.  I'm sorry.","1"

"So the past six months have been especially hard for me. I have consistently thought about committing to suicide. Starting back, again, six months ago. It has been an ongoing problem for years to come now but the past 6 months it has been increasingly intense. 6 months ago I found myself thinking about this once a week. 4 months ago about twice a week. Fast forward to now. I wake up every morning and the problem opens up immediately. I have come to the point where I tell myself that today is the day. Today is going to end all the pain and suffering. Tomorrow I will not have to worry about the issues at hand. I have always been a person to cover up these problems, so no one I am remotely close to has any idea what is going on. These past 6 months I have essentially isolated myself from everything. Nothing I do anymore has any meaning in life. What is the purpose anymore? I have a lovely girlfriend that does not even want to have sex with me anymore. I have 'friends' whom are only concerned about getting fucked up. And I am over here working at a Big 5 company. Excellent pay, but on the inside none of it is really worth it. Why must I care? My entire life is extremely dull. I have no longer found joy in anything I once loved to do. It is taking a huge toll on my relationship with my girlfriend. If that relationship fails I literally have nothing else worth living for. Absolutely nothing. I am afraid to see someone, especially professional. I believe that if I do they are going to take away all of the firearms that I own. It is pretty stupid to think this. I know. But I also do not want to be known as a failure for seeking help.. If my 'parents' (adopted) were to find out, I feel as if they will tell me to 'suck it up' or 'quit being a bitch' as they have in the past. All support structures in my life are against me because no one understands. I try to talk to my girlfriend about these things but when I explain, which is a very hard thing to do, she merely does not understand as she has never experienced anything like this herself. I am alone. Nothing in life is worth it anymore..............What do I do?Is it ever going to be worth it anymore?","1"

Why did I ever get my hopes up? This is all my fault. I dont know how Im gonna do it, but Im going to try to kill myself(5th times the charm, right?). ","1"
"I was going to kill myself in September, but I chickened out. I waited through October. And you know what, it only got worse. A 25 thousand dollar lawsuit. So I decided that now was the time. I tried to hang myself, but the beam gave out and I fell and fucked up my ankle. I spent a week in the mental ward, getting berated by doctors and nurses for being selfish and not thinking about others. Of course no one came to visit me or even gave a fuck. So yeah, you never know what tomorriw will bring. For me, tomorrow just brings more shit.","1"
"Im 17 years old and for 16 years of my life Ive had to live with my drug addicted mother. I live in West Virginia which is known as one of the worst drug addicted states in the U.S. Ever since we moved to a new house within the same state my mother had begun the habit of pill-popping and over the years developed into a habit of smoking crack and shooting up heroin. My father has been there for us and my two sisters for the entirety of her drug abuse and has beaten himself down into almost bankruptcy due to supporting my mothers habits and just trying to keep our family afloat (father has never touched any illegal drug himself). The last 16 years of my life have been miserable. Ive grown up without any love or affection whatsoever and never had experienced it truly. We have been poor most of the 16 years and it has driven my fathers stress so badly that overtime he had developed many health concerns. By the time I reached the age of understanding (around 12 y/o) I struggled with depression and suicidal thoughts and tendencies, Im still coping with it to this day. Ive been to therapy and was told to have severe PTSD. Ive had two attempts in the last year, and am still contemplating. Recently, I fell out of a relationship that actually made things seem okay. I started dating this girl the first day I met her. She happened to be a nerdy, smart, caring, and a bit bossy. She really was unlike anyone Ive ever been infatuated with. At the time I was behind in all my classes, struggling at home with the worst case of depression Ive ever had, and just overall slowly fading away. This girl was so brave to take all of my baggage on, I couldnt help but fall hard. She put me on the right track. I was at the top of my classes again and actually taking ahold of my life and making it go somewhere. This relationship lasted a year, a year free of worry and hardship really. Once it was over, everything went back to the way it used to be. That was two months ago and Ive gone nowhere but downhill since then. After years of feeling nothing this was a huge change. You cant just take that away after a year and expect things to be as happy as they have been. Everyone says things will get better, they have been for 16 years. But out of all those years, only one has been worth staying for. Other than that its all gone downhill. I really dont know where else to go with this other than Im the most suicidal I have ever been and its a constant thought in my head. I dont know where else to go or what to do. ","1"
"Why should I continue... if there is nothing but pain and tragedy ahead? I've paid all of my dues, since I have hit rock bottom yet again, and I no longer want to be here, but it is only out of some morbid, distant, very vague sense of duty that I'm still around.To be honest, I always feel and felt forced into getting into situations, or even hooking up with certain women, that I never loved, and am always forced into things though I am completely against them. I can never be with who I want to, and then another side of my comes out and says you don't need anyone. I am constantly swapping between personas throughout each day, probably out of split personality disorder.I'm tired of being told what to do. How would you like it? Yet... you do it to me, and I'd rather be fucking dead, not having to play this game any more. I want to quit the game, and I utterly don't give a fuck. It's hard to continue, when you can never have the questions answered that you want answered, and also when you can never even begin to have faith that the person you dream of being with is actually even possible, and it isn't. It's just another deception, like all of the deceptions my entire life has been. This life is literally about reproducing and experiencing the world. That's literally it, there's nothing more to life than that, and I just can't compete in the game. Too much harm has been inflicted on me, and I simply can't handle any more. I can't handle anything more, and all I ask is nothing, because there's nothing to ask for, nothing to gain, and nothing for me to lose.I've had enough.You know how people say, ""Do what you love and you'll be successful?""My honest response to that, is that I love to do nothing but sleep and disassociate from the world. I don't actually enjoy doing anything, and thus I cannot do what I love. I love nothing about this world, and it's hard to be motivated to even do things if you just don't care. ","1"
"Yup I'm done with my life.I literally have zero friends to talk to and zero emotional support.I'm a 22 yr grown ass man and this is soul crushing and depressed af.So why bother living at all..i can't keep doing this forever.Anyways no one is gonna care for me but just thought of venting it out.:(","1"
"I hate everything about myself. From the physical aspects to my personality. I think I walk weird, my voice sounds annoying to me, I'm too short, I'm not terribly ugly but I would be weirded out if I found out someone was attracted to me. I think I am disgusting.         I'm very introspective, barely ever say a word unless spoken to, most people probably think I'm boring and I really am, because I can't be bothered to be interested in the same things they are (like social media and parties). I think I am socially retarded, I cannot connect with others, I have had very little friends throughout my life, I feel out of place and a freak most of the times. I struggle a lot with understanding speech in noisy environments or over a telephone - not sure if it's some sort of auditory processing issue or hearing loss. I was just talking to a woman on the phone and she lost her patience because I kept saying I wasn't understanding what she was saying - she told me I should listen because she wasn't going to repeat herself again. I am overly sensitive to criticism because it just hurts my already inferior self. I don't like being complimented either because it feels like people are placing expectations on me and I think I am talentless and useless and I won't be able to do as well as they'd like next time around. People tell me I'm smart but I don't understand why - sometimes I am just a little better informed and that's all. I tend to make a lot of stupid mistakes when I am anxious (in social situations or not) and that just makes me feel even worse.            Be honest. Would you like to spend time with someone you hated? Probably not. I would have to spend time with myself for the rest of my life. So I don't want to do that anymore. I wish my parents had had another child just so I wouldn't feel as terrible about this. ","1"
"i do nothing, i pursue nothing, i am capable of nothing. im a vestigial organ of this world, broken, useless, obsolete. what is there for me in life? pain? lonelyness? failure? despair? im in a hole with only more holes down and no way up. my only hope is a spiders thread, but its futile to grab. i wouldnt give my hopes up grabbing at it because i will only fall deeper like a sick game. whats more, is im alone here. only my mind to keep me company, to keep me crazy to make me hate myself more. ive pursued happiness, ive tried my gamble on my dreams and i have lost everything. my loved one is the only one that keeps me here, with quills of a lonely porcupine they draw me into their embrace. it makes me dream of better times, and despair on its reality. moments of sadness and hatred echo, i cannot forgive and i cannot forget. what torments me more? them or me? i cannot take this life but i can only endure this cruel joke. when will i break? have i already been broken? i only know im a shell of myself not when ive changed. corrupt with malice im full of hate. i wont forgive anyone, did they really put me here though? or am i just finding things to blame for my own insufficiency? i hate my hate. this, desire to hurt is frustrating. i cannot hurt others, but i want to. i want to hurt myself, but i cannot. my walls tease me with temptation, mockingly barren of a hole and blood. i imagine my hands and arms bloodied and broken from hitting things. i once considered fighting as a sport, but im a coward even with my body built for war, for fighting. i ruin this body with neglect only thinking ""what is the point?"" only to further damn myself. it wouldnt do any good either, im incapable of doing anything well. like a jack of all trades except im worse in all trades. i cant even do simple math in my head, i cant talk to people well, im socially anxious, ridden with insecurities and self consciousness. what use is such a person? do i even have the right to be called such a thing? i paint myself innocent but find myself uncaring of anyone other then my lover. but im a demon with a porcelain mask, and a sexual deviant. its strange, i can accept other people deviant prefrences, but i cant even accept my own sexuality which even goes described as ""tame"" from other deviants. mabey im afraid what others think? in dont even allow others outside family to know about my homosexual side of things and even then, not all my family knows. im homophobic, afraid of sexual conatact with another person. mabey its the insults ive recieved my whole life, being called ""gay"" or a ""faggot"". it could of been my taumatic experiences that scar me today, making me question if it wasnt as bad as i tell myself. mabey it was that bad. the only real thing is the feeling of betrayal or the ignorance of the action. its late when im down, impossible to resist putting sleep off in my depressed state. i hate sleep. i love sleep. it takes my time awake, but it feels nice to slumber only made worse by my long out of control sleep cycles. alseep for 10 hours or more, awake for 14 hours or more feeling like im constantly living outside of time. i never know what day or time it is, its hard to keep track when the next day begins before i go back to sleep. when theres nothing to look forward to so i dont count the days to anything. the only things allowing me to keep track are the seasons. i even forget how old i am. why count something so useless? ""congrats! youve lived xxx amount of years! just wait till you xxx when you grow old and die!"". and thats if i somehow manage to get that far without something causing my untimely demise. id welcome it if it werent for the fact that every way i go would likely be painful if its health related, and much worse if it has to do with my living arrangement which surely wont last forever. whod want to take care of a autistic, sexual deviant, man-child? it only makes me a burden. either i end up never living with my SO and continue painfully living with my mother till she dies and then end up dying on the streets or something, or, i live with my SO causing them more stress then they deserve, more strain on them finacially while they take care of their own family on top of me. the might even kill themselves leaving me to bear the pain of losing them as well. i want them happy, but theres nothing i can do. i cant even make myself happy. though they said it in stress as i was trying to comfort them, i believe its completely true. ""what fucking good are you then?!"". it was worse to hear then my own father saying ""im leaving because of you"" before living in michigan with his girlfriend and her children while leaving me behind with my brother and sister. even with him gone, my brother replaces him while almost being just as emotionally abusive. my sister bathing in attention. at least shes not mean like she used to be, but shes never shown remorse for how she treated me. i might as well be a redheaded stepchild. now to sleep and hate myself for wasting valuable time with my SO because of my depression. and fuck thanksgiving, everyone laughingn in the living room as i remain in my room. nothing to make you feel more lonely then no one to keep you company and the only people who could are either asleep due to a different timezone or, they are spending time with people you hate or you really dont belong with them in the first place. being so different only makes spending time with people reflect how alone you are.","1"
"Every damn year on my birthday is the same.. suicidal thoughts/planning for a month leading up to my birthday, culminating in either an attempt or just more planning for closer to Christmas.I've been suicidal for the past 8 years like this and I'm only just turning 20. This sucks so bad and I just don't want to go on.I'm stuck in a job I hate with a boyfriend I don't know how I feel about.. I just want to be alone but he needs my support so I have to keep making him happy.I just want to drink the pain away and drive a knife into my veins until it's all over, or crash my car off the highway.. I'm so sad and so tired of being this sad.I think tonight's the night, I'm numb enough to not feel any regret, and I've convinced my boyfriend I'm happy enough for him to not be concerned if I go out.

"Most people here want to commit suicide because they were raped or abused or something horrible and traumatic happened to them. This is not my case at all. I am 17, raised in a middle income family in a good part of town. My parents are married, treat me well, I go to a good school and all that. It's my beta genes that fucked it all up. I have the perfect combination of depression, adhd and ocd to fuck up my life. I have tried plenty of different medications as well as therapy and nothing seems to help. The world is unforgiving for people like me. What point is there to live. Also why the fuck is there an upvote system. Is my fucking suicide plea not interesting enough","1"
"Hi there guys I really cannot put into words what i feel, or perhaps nothing or numb. I am 20 and think for the best part of ten years I've been depressed I've had a couple of attempts on my own life earlier on 13/14 and now feel I could do it again. My existence is a futile and pointless exercise. I am a destructive force which hurts those who love me and influence lives for the worse, I'm not selfish I understand how it can hurt friends and family but it would be less than a lifetime of myself. Using drugs used to work but i don't even have the effort for those now, I find myself purposely losing money gambling just to feel something as that's all I want. My whole life I just wanted to love and be accepted that will be my biggest regret. This isn't a farewell but it might be I can't see where to go from here. Wishing you all peace now and foreveradogwithfingers","1"
"I know of someone who is thinking about killing themselves. They just cut themselves.They don't have a good home environment (no father to speak of, judgemental stepfather, questionable mother). They are currently being targeted/stalked by their newly crazy ex who has hacked into every Facebook they've made and can apparently change their own grades by hacking into the school's system. This guy uses the deep web perhaps regularly. He has beat her in the past and blamed it on being 'possessed by spirits' and is threatening and degrading her (telling her that her parents didn't want her, that she is a whore that will go to hell). Her mom has told her to just block him but he is talking to her on HER account so he can just delete all of the messages and obviously she can't block him.I am scared for them. Last time they were considering suicide they called the suicide hotline, the hotline contacted their mother and I guess she received some help. But she was apparently ridiculed for it at school. Her religious stepfather thinks she is a whore.  Also the school councilor that they spoke with (about the threats from ex) contacted her mother and somehow her ex found out what they had been saying, maybe through Facebook? Over all, they are being blamed by others and are not being helped. Not sure what kind of institutions are in place to help people who are in these situations. Please help me help them.","1"
"Our upstairs neighbors whose house is attached to ours have had a severe rodent problem for a long time and this one mouse means a lot more are coming. The rats up there used to keep me up from about 3am-5am it got so bad. My landlord did nothing about it but we are in a sensitive financial situation right now and we don't want to rock the boat.Everything is bad right now. My only real friend lives 8 hours away and I hate school and my job. My mom can't pay rent so I am using my savings to pay the rent for a disgusting house that I hate but moving is not an option. I have been suicidal since I was a freshman in high school and I am a freshman in college now and my situation is worse. My family is very financially unstable. We have SNAP but I know I am going to start wasting my money on fast food after this.I get somewhat obsessive about cleanliness and contamination and have tried to make my house, mostly just my bedroom and kitchen, feel like a sanctuary but I know I am not going to be able to feel that way again after this. I also have a lot of food related anxiety and I am unable to put on weight and it is going to be a bigger issue now. I am just so overwhelmed and I am an adult now so my problems feel more intense and real and I am not ready for it, i'd absolutely rather just be dead.I am being over dramatic and a brat but I feel like that stupid ugly mouse is gonna be my breaking point.","1"
"Since Monday I have been homeless. I am a 42 year old male and had been staying in an abandoned apartment but had to leave on Monday and I had nowhere to go. I have no friends nearby, no family and no money to arrange accommodation. I have been a member of suicidewatch for a couple of months now and found much support in helping others, listening and just talking to fellow depression sufferers who are feeling suicidal. I thought I had accommodation until mid December but the apartment I was in is being demolished and I was told last week that I had to leave on Monday. Thanks to the kindness of a stranger here I was able to afford a cheap room for three nights but last night was on the streets for the first time. I have one large suitcase with all my clothes and stuff in but no money to get a cheap room anymore while I try to get help from the council. I did not sleep last night through worry and I am writing this in the hope that someone can help because I have tried to kill myself before and am worried that I will try again if I find myself on the streets. I feel like there is hope because I'm told I will get an emergency benefit payment next week (probably Thursday) but until then, with no money, I will be on the streets. I have somewhere to stay, but it is over 50 miles away and I have no means of getting there. If I could get there I would be safe until the benefits payment comes in. So a train could either save my life by taking me to safety or kill me if I get so desperate that I throw myself beneath one. Is there anyone who can help me purchase a train ticket so I can  secure safe accommodation for the next week while the council sort my benefits and find me somewhere to live? Thank you for reading.","1"
"I am right on the edge today. I been close before but managed to pull it back. However this week I have been struggling to get through each day.I wake up in the morning say goodbye to my partner and my little bump that I love so much. Has been only thing keeping me going. However today when I said goodbye it felt final. For the first time ever.Its actually bringing me a little bit of peace. All the emotions have gone. Only thing that has kept me going is not wanting to hurt my family.The straw that has final broken me is a financial one today. I need to make a 200 payment today and I have no idea where I can get it from. Life has spiraled out of control and I been struggling to cope now for 3 years.I have wrote e-mails and set them up to send at midnight tonight to all my love ones. I am going to see out this day of work and then go for a long walk away from people and my family so only the paramedics will find me when the letters go out.I wanted to just be honest in one last place before I go.

"I heard a comedian make a joke about suicide once. The general gist of it was if you go to the movies and the first half is unrelenting shit then yeah, you can reasonably guess it's not going to get better and you may as well check out. That's how life is feeling right about now. At this point I can reasonably assume the best is not yet to come. In fact everything coming after this will probably be the same as this, but with more body aches. And this...has not been great. I wait tables. Badly. I graduated high school. Barely. Things that should be easy are hard. Things that should be kind of hard seem fucking impossible. The anxiety and sadness and tiredness I feel every day makes it hard to get out of the house. I used to think being in a relationship would make things better. If anything it's worse.  Before that I thought having friends would make me happy. They're just another thing that takes work, another thing to always feel like I'm losing. There are moments of something like joy. Moments of sort of feeling ok, but they don't last long. They make the rest of the time feel worse. Every reason I can find to not do this rings hollow, sounds like an empty platitude. I think it's finally really time to accept the reality that's been beating me over the head for as long as I can remember. Every moment I've not done it was fueled by denial. It's not going to get better. I've hoped it would for over 3 decades and it's about time I accept reality.","1"
"So yeah,14 y/0 HS dropout that everyone hates..Since the first 2 months of my depression,I wanted to die already and it's been 2 years since then!...Since last month,i've decided that i wont go through anymore....It's not because i wanted to do it,I just realized that whatever i do i just cant seem to motivate myself for a long period of time...So im just trying to find the right time to go to ma auntie's condo where she lives to jump...Tbh with ya'll,Im happy right now...Im doing everything okay and acting normal,But im finishing the things i should watch,Playing the last games i want to play and play basketball with other people...Im just finishing the things i wanna do or i should do so i have no regrets anymore...I figured that everyone would be shocked or sad for a few months but i remember that suicide is a ""Permanent Solution"" so that means i wont have to worry about them since its a permanent solution..Right now im living life as it is,Happy outside and sad inside ma room...But it's better this way.I've planned it all out already,At 12:00MD,Im gonna go and see a beautiful and nice view at the rooftop without anyone for the first time,I always wanted to do it,A peaceful time alone with the cold breeze and the starry night..And then finally at 1:00PM or 2:00PM,Im gonna jump and leave a letter that says ""Goodbye""...And im also gonna put ""The End"" at my diary on the day i will jump (Which i will hide on OUR house lol )..So yeah it's up to them to understand why because i know that the ones that truly loves me will understand right away..So btw this is not a ""Help"" letter or a ""Motivation"" letter,I simply posted this because this is also a part of the last things i wanna do because if some people here wanna find me and see this,Or even my family maybe,Atleast they'll know that im gone or what the reason is....It's also not something i posted for popularity,But if any of you want to help then gladly please...But i've already reached that point,The point where you just calm down and finally end everything...But this wont be my last post yet i think,But this will be one of my last posts..Because that day is really close lol,So i guess see ya'll in hell? lmao","1"

"My plan ever since I was 17 was to wait for my parents to die, and then kill myself. I figured I would not have to face that reality until i was at least 30, but here I am at 22 having thought about suicide every day for the past two years. I'm past the point of saving or convincing not to do it. The only thing that was stopping me from not doing it was the pain my parents would go through, but all suffering is temporary just like all life is temporary. Taking my life would strike nothing off the total time I spend dead, so what's the point in continuing?The first time I thought about killing myself was in the fifth grade. I was 10 years old, crying on the floor with a knife aimed at myself. The 12 years I've spent since then I've been mediocre, filled with nothing worthwhile. life Has provided me with no reason to consider my existence anything less than insignificant.at this point, the only people that would miss me more than a few months after my death would be my immediate family. so why should i continue living in fucking dread and torment almost every waking moment of my life just to keep a few people from feeling sad a few times before they die. it doesn't make sense to me. we'll all be dead for eternity. none of us will be remembered. Someone just give me a reason why i shouldn't kill my self now instead of after my parents are dead.","1"
"I want to die. I want to get stabbed or shot or just die in some way. I want to die now so I don't have to fail this fucking class. If I somehow weasel my way out of failing, then I want to die because I don't want to have to struggle through even worse classes next quarter. If I get through that, then I want to die because I'll have even worse classes.And if I get through all of that, then I still want to die because I'm alone. It's not a temporary problem. It's a never ending supply of temporary problems. What's the prize at the end? Nothing. It's a choice. I can end it now and be freed of this suffering, or keep on taking this for years, overcoming obstacles and being in pain most of the time. It's an obvious choice. It's not like I was going to change the world. It's not like there's anyone I love who is worth fighting for.I don't want to die. I want to find someone to love, and fight through life so I can be happy with them, but I'm not fucking delusional and I know how unrealistic that is. Death is just the lesser of two evils. ","1"
