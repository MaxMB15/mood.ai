I owe money to like four different hospitals because of all the times I went to the E.R. thinking I was dying from something that turned out to be a panic attack.

11,"Jesus. How do I even start. All of this is so obvious and yet for years I haven't been able to grasp what's been happening with me in the past 12 years (I'm now 22).I'll start with the context. I've been dealing with depressive thoughts and anxiety for a period of about 5 years now and haven't been able to pinpoint the exact reasons for why I felt about myself the way I did (yeah, the imfamous ""brain fog"").I managed to finish school with ""good enough"" grades and enroll at a nice university. I have been an alright student for the most part and been successful with all the exams/challenges that came my way. But in late 2015 (the last year of my bachelors programme) I started noticing that I was not actually satisfied with my education, in fact - I didn't even like most of the courses. That dissatisfaction had lead to me questioning whether or not I should continue the chosen academic path and whether a master's degree in that specialization was worth investing an additional 2 years into or not. At that time I thought to myself: ""Of course I should go on with my education, it's a no brainer!"". Well, things started getting really bad this year when the time for my dissertation to be written has finaly come. Oh, how much was I procrastinating while having no coherent idea of the subject for my thesis... This struggle made me wonder why it's so difficult for me to come up with good ideas and that's exactly when the revelation came.FAKE. Faking. I've been faking everything since age 11. My middle school education, my interest in university courses, ""friends"". Everything was fake.I'm yet to fully grasp all the details and circumstances of the moment I turned from being a clever, curios and inquisitive boy to someone who felt the need to fake everything. But I know for a fact that it all happened when I stopped hanging out with well-behaved kids and made friends with a kid who acted like a hooligan all the time. Oh well...It's kind of shameful to arrive at such conclusion when I'm a 22-year old guy but I guess better late than never.

In all those terrible fanfics we love(d?) to read, eventually that loyalty would pay off and we'd get our happy ending. In reality, my love for you is a ghost that haunts my every step, reminding me every minute of every day at how close I came to nirvana. Of how of all people I was going to get my happily ever after.

Normally I can handle myself and still stay productive, but over the last two years I've felt my grip on myself start to slip.For the past 3 days, it's been worse than it's been in years. I can't even talk to anybody I know about it because they don't understand what it's like. ""Just do something fun that'll make you happy"" and ""You need religion"" were two of the responses I've gotten so far when I try to reach out.I had a friend who understood, someone who has experienced it for himself, but last night I lashed out and now I think it's over between us. Whenever I get really depressed, I don't know how to handle myself. I can't afford meds or a therapist with my work and insurance now and I'm just really scared.Last night, for the first time since I was in high school, I seriously considered suicide. I managed to convince myself that I only had friends because they pitied me, and my family only kept in contact because they feel guilty. For the first time in a long time, I felt completely alone.Don't get me wrong.

32,"I was having a chat with my friend whos off in university yesterday and I talking about humanity as a topic. Hows were all truly selfish and how compassion is just a lie. Where in reality we all do these actions to make ourselves feel better. To boost our ego and to just make feel like were someone better. Just if your comforting someone whos crying and youre comforting them out of pity so that you can make yourself feel better you know? He said, that my views on humanity are dangerous and thats hes concerned for my mental health now. He says that its getting worse. I said that I dont trust everyone except a select few (3-4 people) not even my parents or my relatives. Cause I dont trust people until they reveal their true intentions, colours etc. After I said this, he got very concerned.  Hes asking me to see the real world. But I see the real world for as it is. Hes saying Im not and instead of looking at rose-coloured glasses Im looking at the world with Dark-Black coloured glasses.  Afterwards I asked him why, and he said that hes afraid Ill kill myself because of these thoughts or think so little of human life that I become a sociopath and kill someone. He remembers when I was a compassionate and caring, and how he says that Im hiding everything behind a black and negative curtain. How Im losing myself and turning into a very dark and cynical person. Theyre right I guess. My mental health and my own personality has been very dark and cynical lately. I dont like talking to anyone, like I used to. I consider everyone an annoyance. All the chores I do are just meaningless. Like right now I should be studying. But I dont want to. Like whats the point. I just want to forget everything. Not only that, I feel like Im running out of time. Of my own existence or how long Im gonna last. And judging from that sense, Im not gonna last that much longer if I keep going down this path. ",1,-0.100000001,10.10000038,0.393480957,0.125646293,0.031625528,0.272828937,0.176418275
33,"So maybe this post isn't all to the point in some places, but I just like to get things off my chest.I'm a guy in my mid-twenties and I've been living in a new city on my own for a couple of months now. I moved out of my parents' after I had my first full time job for a year or so. I've had periods of depression before, mainly due to feelings of loneliness and (social) anxiety. I don't have any close friends, because in the past I'd either feel fine being on my own or otherwise felt too anxious to go out and actually meet people. I was certain that living on my own would become more difficult in that regard, so I needed to do something to counteract a possible recurring depression. What I did was join a dance class in that city. I still take classes and go to social dance evenings regularly and I really enjoy it. It has also been a great boost in building self-confidence and I've become a bit less uptight around people. So this has been one of the best decisions I've made in life so far I'm certain.Another thing I did was join a martial arts class, to get more in shape and also to make friends of course.I sometimes attend a meetup. I've also been thinking about going out of the house more and work on my sketchbook in public places; since I enjoy drawing and might also meet people this way hehe. But aside from these things I don't much hang out with people outside of the classes and I feel lonely a lot. Yesterday I felt miserable to spend the night alone in my apartment.A couple of months ago I was travelling somewhere for a week and I met a lovely girl. We were both interested in drawing, it's actually her profession, and I think it clicked well between us. We spent a couple of days together there, and after separating we kept in touch through texts because we live quite far apart now. A while ago we talked about travel plans and she said she liked to meet again when I asked her, so now we're going to travel together again for about three weeks. :DSo that's going to happen and I'm very excited and happy about this. However, what makes me feel a little sad and sometimes bitter is that, when I hear what's she's doing or when I look her up on social media, it looks like she's having such an interesting life. She seems to have many good friends and her career allows her to travel a lot and meet so many interesting people. I know she's worked so hard for this and I think she has really earned it, but I can't help the feeling of inadequateness and sadness when I reflect back on my life right now.Maybe I'm just whining. Hope you guys are willing to give some advice on how to approach this. Thanks!",1,0.400000006,11.60000038,0.025336158,0.370365679,0.500967026,0.097829208,0.005501871

37,"TL;DR:Depressed, anxious, shut in, lonely, heartbroken, suicidal, really need someone to speak to.Heya, I've posted here before which you can see on my profile, but nothing has stuck. Basically the same thing applies, but I really do now know how I can even make it through tonight feeling this empty and lonely. I don't start my anti-depressants until Thursday, and even then they can take weeks before they come into affect. I never speak up until I'm was past my limit, which is why it has taken me so many years to even see a doctor, which I did for the first time last Thursday but I was stupid and hesitated on the anti-depressants so now I must wait until Thursday. I have something for my anxiety but all it does is stop my body from shaking by slowing my heart or something, but does nothing to actually help the feeling. I'm still shut in and even struggling to go downstairs for food.I appreciate kind messages, but the amount of times I've heard the same stuff, it just feels so meaningless and empty. Hopefully I can find someone who understands, or even willing to just try and understand. I would prefer voice calling too, even though I get so scared of answering the phone etc, words on a screen are just so empty. It would be awkward to start with but I'm okay once I warm up to people a little bit.Again, with my stupid thoughts, I would appreciate it if you were female, I've never been able to speak to guys, I use to have one close guy friend but he moved away when we left school and I haven't spoken to him since. He was the only one who knew how I felt, with my self harm and suicidal thoughts. I'm sorry I have this mindset but I find it far easier to speak to someone who is female. I went through a really tough breakup in September too so love is not on my mind, I don't want to love or be loved in that way again.If you made it this far, I really appreciate it and I hope you have a lovely afternoon.

40,"Hey there! I've never actually posted a new thread on reddit before, but I think this is a topic that is most definitely worth giving the honour as my first post.I've been living with endogenic depression for a couple years now, I tried councilling and I found it way too difficult to open up to a stranger, so that didn't really work. I went to the doctors and was prescribed Sertraline. For a lot of people this drug does wonders, but for me it did not. Less than a week in I started to develop violent thoughts. After a couple weeks they were getting way too much to handle and I decided that they were not the answer for me.This made me feel hopeless, as you could imagine. I felt like this black hole which festers inside of me would never go away. About a week ago, my dad has suggested that I should try Valerian root tablets (500mg). I was very skeptical at first, I thought that if modern day pharmaceuticals did not work, then how could a plant? I know Valerian is usually used for Anxiety, but often enough anxiety and depression go hand in hand. Since I started taking them, I've woken up every morning feeling calm & composed. I haven't felt depressed now for about 4 days (unprecedented since I've falled prey to depressions foul grasp) and I haven't felt this good about myself for longer than I can remember.If anyone reading this can relate to anything I have wrote, I really do suggest you try it. I got 60 tablets from my local herbalist for 9 and I can honestly say you should give it a try. I don't know how much drugs like Sertraline cost in the US with your healthcare system, but if its more expensive than that, it may be worth exploring...If you're feeling like there are no more avenues to explore, don't give up hope just yet! You never know when a branch of hope will be extended, but it will come!

66,"My friend has cut twice now, and has only told it to my other friend and I. The first time after we talked with her, she seemed to know not to do it again, though I think she was only more depressed thinking herself an idiot for doing it in the first place. However, a few days ago she had done it again and showed it to my other friend. This other friend told me and we both agreed the school counselor needed to be involved, as her parents supposedly previously dismissed her depression and refused to have her diagnosed. I assume her parents were immediately contacted as when I got back home, she had been threatening my other friend through a group chat, saying that now her parents knew, her life was ruined. Today, somehow she found out I was involved as well and has been spamming me angrily. Im scared to confront her on Monday, but I was prepared for that. What Im more scared of is the possibility that she may think because of this that her life has been ruined and that continuing cutting and even suicide is a good idea. Edit:I just want this to end.

67,"This is a pretty long and personal post so I appreciate everyone who reads this.Growing up I had a pretty rough childhood. I used to always get bullied by the other children because of how weak I was. I remember not getting past a day without crying till the 9th grade. Nobody really cared about me at school, everyone just thought of me as the class clown and someone to make fun of. Our financial condition is very poor so I never had all the new stuff that others had. Every passing day was hell for me but I somehow coped up with it.In 9th grade I started trying to be more extroverted. I met this girl who was in my class and we hit it off pretty well. I think at one point she even started to like me. But no matter what I would do I was still weak and pathetic. I was too much of a pussy to tell her that I loved her. Its been more than 3 years since I last talked to her and I still miss her to this day. I would leave away everything just to be with her.Because of this I have been single till now. I'm extremely introverted and haven't had a good conversation with any girl since then. The anxiety and depression also comes due to my poor financial condition. Where I live mostly everyone drives a bike whereas I walk around which just shoots my anxiety up. I'm too poor to even buy new clothes for myself. I've thought of working part time at some job but that's impossible due my college timings. Although I've started making efforts by freelance web designing they have been to no use. In two weeks I will be turning 19 and this is the most depressed and low I have been all my short life. I have officially hit rock bottom. This depression is resting on my heart for two reasons: Love and money. Every day goes on and I keep living like a lifeless zombie. I have no compassion left in life anymore. It's like I don't see the point in living. I would try and kill myself but I can never do that to my mom . She is the only person I care about as much as the girl I love. Even therapy is pointless because I live in a third world country and if I told everyone they would just tell me to deal with it and spending money on therapy is pointless. I don't even know what to do anymore. I am scared about my future. I feel like I am going to die alone and poor.

78,"I apologize for the length of this post, but I'm not much of  a talker and these things tend to fester in my mind for a long time before I air them out. i am not sure where the best place for this post is, so I may put it in multiple subreddits.  I feel like I am losing control now, and something horrible is going to happen. I am no longer feeling ""positive"" about anything. Whereas before I sometimes felt hopeful about things and strived towards socially acceptable goals(although I inevitably fucked up every single time), I am now simply filled with rage. Before it was mild anxiety, or sadness, or hopefulness. Now it is just hopelessness, despair, and RAGE. I feel like I need revenge on something. I cant put my finger on it, but someone needs to pay for my life, and not just mine. I want to break things, I want to scream, I want to beat people to a bloody pulp for minor annoyances. I have never been a sociable person, although I have tried to be in the past two years.   All of these efforts seem wasted, because just like all of my other endeavors, fitness, healthy eating, learning a new language, musical interests,  etc, they are obliterated and made useless in at most a few months, when I slump back into an acceptance of the meaninglessness of life, and feel as if I am unplugged from the matrix. This analogy is a strong representation of how I feel about life in general. Other people are always working towards something and all of their problems seem to be related to that concrete thing. I cant even get past the idea of why I should give a shit in the first place. Perhaps I am cuttoff from the biology that allows them to feel meaning. I am unplugged from my coworkers, my friends, my family. People always say, take a step away and look at a sunset, isn't it beautiful?. Is this supposed to be a trump card or something? Fuck no it isn't beautiful, its just a waste of my time!. Does anyone truly believe in these platitudes, or is it simply a desperate grasp at happiness? IT makes me feel so alien and as if I am simply of a different species when people tell me to do this. Or to find a hobby, or do something I enjoy, or follow my passion. Obviously I do all of these things to the best of my ability, with little success. Perhaps I really am an alien, if the solution is this evident to to other people, and meaningless to me/  Things are only getting worse despite my recent efforts. I don't want to try to get better again. I feel like I am simply pulling the wool over my eyes for a few weeks only to have it inevitably ripped off like a band-aid, and immersed back into the horrifying, real, hopeless world that I know. The temporary hope only makes this process more painful. I hate everything. I used to want a girlfriend. Now I cant understand why anyone would want a girlfriend. I don't want anyone to have these things, I wish only the worst for others. I used to want children. Now I could never bring myself to perpetuate this species, and to bring more people into this world. I hope for the apocalypse. Every day now has simply become a matter of distracting myself until the next day. Its getting more and more difficult. I see no future any longer, which can only mean death. But not before something horrible happens. I am too angry and have too much dignity to simply take myself out of the equation. I have the sinking feeling that someone or something needs to pay for my life. I know it doesn't make sense, but nothing does. I feel abandoned, I am a 20 year old male, and I feel like my childhood was a lie. It didn't prepare me for life as a 9-5 worker. I wasn't quite raised on a silver spoon, but to many I would be. I was raised on the fantasies of the adventures of adult life, rather than grown to accept them. I am not used to feeling this alone, or this independent. My parents always had money, but what they didn't give me was a reason to live. No religion. And many people seem to be able to cope with this, but I cant for some reason. When I fall, there is nothing there to catch me. I mostly live plagued by those dreaded existential thoughts that can never go away. I feel like the next 50 years or so wont be able to compete with my childhood and will only get much much worse. Why should I keep on living? I am having the most terrible thoughts now, blaming others for my misfortune, hating people simply to have something to do, and even though I know they are illogical, I see no reason not to feed them. My life has not gotten better, it has shown me the carrot for brief periods of time, only to plunge me deeper into darkness than ever the next second. I am starting to grow irreversibly bitter. I feel that the truth of the world is horrible. I am starting to accept that. All I do is eat, watch porn, play video games, and watch TV. These are the only things I can sort of focus on. This is not for lack of trying. I have tried innumerable activities. I lose interest in them very quickly. I have attempted to develop the supposed key to life, the holy DISCIPLINE, numerous times and have failed miserable every fucking time. I have tried using a checklist to make my goals manifest, have tried taking things slowly, making small changes here and there, have tried to delay gratification. But why should I? Evidently this question defeats me every time. I am cursed with a brain that thinks itself out of existence. Many people seem to buy right into life. Caring about others, feeling guilt and shame, and happiness, and  sadness. They follow these emotions as if they mean something. As if they have some true level of authority and give them the right to continue to live, a warrant of sorts. I have come to view my emotions as simply another level of control my body and the world put upon me, mere shackles.   I feel like I have a front row seat to the making of a monster. The first step to becoming a monster is to cast off your emotional shackles. The next is to deny responsibility. I have a hard time beleiving in free will, so this has already been accomplished. The last step is to lose hope in a future. Despite the near completion of this process, I feel a strange urge to look back at the illusion. That illusion of  society, unity as a species, love, longingly. I am a little bit afraid to cut ties with this. My whole life has been guided by the facade of a common good, objective meaning, and love for my fellow man. And it has been gradually ripped from my mind piece by piece. I am mildly terrified by all of this, and as always, confused. Is it possible to escape this ?",1,-0.100000001,37.29999924,0.010509363,0.157366455,0.80558157,0.023294836,0.003247754

88,"Hi, I'm F[18] and last year/this spring I ended up with a depression, the second time in my life. As I was 12, I developed an eating disorder which continued as a depression and then led to some test for autism and ADD. The test come out somewhat positive but still very unclear and I have never related to them either. They prescribed me on top of the antidepressants and sleeping pills some Ritalin and later they changed it to Elvanse. Jumping forward a couple years, I'm still taking Elvanse and just as the Ritalin, it gives me some side effects - like headache, sleep deprivation, loss of appetite. No doctor took notice of this so I kept taking them for a couple of years. So last year, medicine was all wrong at the same time as I went through the toughest year in school AND I managed to fuck up almost all my relationships with friends. Some due too jealousy, some due too an arising depression. Letting go of some of these people was hard but really, REALLY good. I don't see any reason to go into my depression any deeper but it was pretty bad.After a while, I actually got some real help and some better medicine. I bought myself a little puppy, Lola, who became my new friend and routine helper. Stuff got a little better and the summer came. I had some trips planned with my family and I actually looked forward to them. My mental state was actually good! I met a guy, who lives 4 hours flight from me which was kinda perfect at the time because I couldn't be coughed up in this relationship like I've done before...School started and it went okey. No social stuff but still okey. It felt good. Met the guy a couple of times during the autumn and my dog Lola made me company every night etc. But now I'm starting to miss having some friends but I have no idea how to find new once. So I'm asking you, other past-depressive people of Reddit who have been in the same position, how'd you do it?

Starting a small part time gig doing repetitive stuff which I think is good for me right now. 5. Mood swings are almost non-existent.Will it benefit you? I can't tell but I would have to say if its more related to glutamate then Ketamine may be of help. Alot of our diet and a few other things wreak havoc on our glutamate system while most of the mainstream chooses to just talk about dopamine and serotonin. Glutamate being out of wack is a serious condition that can lead to horrible diseases down the road.I feel that this can be extremely beneficial to those with suicidial thoughts, depression loops, and need something to cut that thought pattern. You may also have to go on other medications as well, since ketamine can give you brain a break from all the negative thinking and then throw in something to give you motivation to get stuff done. It sucks how much the treatment costs.I'd love to do it once a month. When  ketamine works right its almost like it shuts off a part of your brain that wants to be depressed and over think things. Almost like an anti-anxiety with slight relaxing euphoria. But it doesn't last long. I truly believe the god of dissociatives and depression healing in the future if it ever makes a comeback and begins trials will be MXE. I've tried all sorts of medications with absolutely horrible side effects. While the 2 weeks I did Ketamine wasn't too much fun (had highs/lows) ,once it was over I've been put in this relaxed state of mind. Only bad thing is  that since I have nothing to do or like due to anhedonia it can drive me a bit crazy at times.",1,0,10.10000038,0.043350868,0.404692531,0.329762101,0.187494054,0.034700483
90,"Hey all,I'm a college student and this semester was absolutely horrible. One of my closest friends who helped me so much through this is dead, I hate my classes, I'm starting to hate friends, and I just generically have no hope for anything. I don't want to drop out but I don't want to sit at home and work and work and work endlessly. I'm barely finding the motivation to finish this post. I can't find the motivation to finish a half-page cover letter to an extremely important apprenticeship for the summer that I need, and I've been working on that for literally 3 weeks now, for half a fucking page. Just, how the hell do you cope with this? Video gaming is a bore, I'm exercising my sorry ass off, I eat healthy, I read, and nothing is helping me. I'm trying meds and I hate them. I've tried journaling to cope and it's done nothing but made it worse. The person I could just hug it out with and talk to forever is gone. Just what the fuck? How do you manage this shit? Fuck this depression.I do hate to say I've fallen enough where I've tried/attempted/made an attempt to kill or hurt myself 5 times in total these past 3 months (wussed out trying it with a knife twice, next time I messed up the noose and it failed(The closest I've gotten), third I tried to  walk to a bridge to jump off but couldn't after a friend saw me and wouldn't stop following me after they detected something was wrong with me, after that I generically tried choking myself out with a belt which clearly does not work).I mean, I dunno I don't want to die but fuck this. I hate this shit. I talked about all of this with her and she always comforted me and just hugged it out with me until I was better, and now she's gone. I'm trying to talk about this little by little with my other closer friends, but they don't understand. Like yes I'm depressed stop over reacting. I don't know how I'm suppose to bring up my attempts.I don't know what to do. I've got a school break in 2 weeks and desperately want to get better in my month-long break. I desperately want to get off working at least until Christmas to cope. I don't want to take a college break. I want to come back happy next semester.

97,"I was very depressed as a kid. I lost a parent when I was 10, but it didn't affect me directly. It was having nothing to do, no parent to guide you. My dad (who took care of me) had lost his wife so he was in bad shape and never really gave me attention. I played video games,  a LOT. 10 hours a day. I failed school and got a dead end job, all that rubbish.Then, while I was 17-19 I found it. I found the thing that took me out of what seemed to be a depression cycle. I started earning good money. I mean really good money. Money a 17 year old shouldn't earn. But I was the best salesman that company had ever seen because I just wouldn't stop chasing the money. Like a fucking rabid dog. Them two years I worked my ass off to make my own company, because I wanted more and more money. I took better care of myself, but most importantly I got a girlfriend. It was like I never realised I had depression, and I had finally broken out of it. I could walk into any public place with a smile on my face. I felt like people were always happy to see me. Felt like the king of the world.I started my business, it failed. I learned a lot. I didn't give up, I was on the verge of doing well. I got back to the drawing board, working hard to rewrite my mistakes.Then my dad kicked me out. 2 months I was sleeping in my car, no contact. I was in a bad place, but still happy. I had my girlfriend, and got another deadend job so I could invest the proceeds to my business.Then my girlfriend left me. It's hard losing the first girl you love, we were together for 2 years. Combined with the lack of money and progress, and the homelessness, that's where I slipped back into the depression cycle.Right now it's the weekend, usually I'd be out for dinner, or away visiting another city or even country. I had everything, yet here I am writing my thoughts out in the hope to find some motivation.My business is all set and ready to go. I've been working at this dead end job for 5 months, saving as much as I possibly can. Everyone took the piss out of me at the start. I was put in bins, stones thrown at me. Beaten up, verbally abused every day.I don't know if I'll ever be like I was. I would much rather relive the last two years than the rest of my life. All I know is that I have been working my ASS off. I'm talking 16 hour days.They say money doesn't make you happy. Maybe it doesn't to the majority. But I strive to be wealthy. It's what I've always wanted. On the new year I'm going to get back to business, and start making some serious money. Quitting both jobs. No bullshit, no feeling guilty for leaving. I'm going back to the person I used to be, taking no shit from anyone. Get myCharisma back. Clean myself up.I've worked so hard to reach the level of happiness I've always wanted.

105,"I got the nexplanon implant almost a year ago and as a form of birth control I love the fact that it's always just there and I don't have to ""maintain"" it (like taking a pill every day) and I especially love that it's completely stopped my periods.Since I got it I've noticed myself having more mood swings and feeling depressed more often, especially after 6 months when my periods stopped. I know these are possible side effects but I don't know if they are coming from the implant or if it's just me and I don't know what to do. Like I said I love it as a form of birth control and the main reason I chose it is because I know I wouldn't be able to swallow a pill every day since I hate swallowing pills.

When I was around 14 my interest in and desire to experience something more became manifest and I got into smoking hash which eventually turned into almost 10 years of daily smoking weed ( with some breaks here and there) I also got into cocaine which I believe was very damaging to me, also speed, MDMA.. I suffered alot and when I look back now it seems that from 16 onwards I was a mess, alot of depression and struggle. I stopped all drugs by age 22 , hardest thing to stop was weed, after I stopped I was a mess, the world was empty to me , had anger issues, couldn't find any pleasure or peace or normality anywhere.. around this same time I started to notice a pattern.. that I would have 2 weeks where I felt really good, the world was great and I loved myself and life.. then I'd have 2 weeks of horrible depression like someone had switched the life switch off.After noticing this I began to research over the next few years and became convinced that I had bipolar ( the more mild type not sure if it's type 1 or 2 , think it's 1 ) so this went on for few years , up and down up and down until recently.. This year since august something really changed.. I haven't felt that ""high"" , mania , or normality.. whatever it actually is.. it just doesn't come anymore.. and I'm going through hell trying to figure out what's wrong with me and how to fix it or improve it.. last few months I feel like I've lost my identity, lost my personality, lost my existence..

I really want to see some kind of doctor who really knows what they're doing and can do tests and find out what's actually wrong with me , why I don't feel right and how to fix it..

109,"Ive never done this before. My mother always taught me to keep personal life and problems to myself. I am 28 yrs old(male) and ive been feeling depressed for a while now but recently its becoming so crippling unbearable its hard for me not to break down all the time. Its a long story but i feel alittle background will help you understand how I feel.I have always been a happy go lucky kid. Never the cool kid but everyone loved me and i loved everyone. I always wanted to please everyone i could and somtimes i would purposly take the brunt of jokes to see someone else smile or happy. Maybe because i felt the pain of being sad and never wanted anyone to ever feel that way. Anyways, my dreams were always small. Have kids, raise a family, buy a house have a decent job and car. Basically all i ever wanted. Even when i was in my teens these were basically all of my main goals in life.Cutting to the chase somewhat. A girl i always had a crush on in middle and high school was my best friend. I was infactuated with her. Loved everything about her. I am hispanic and so is she. And i knew she always had this little spicy attitude to her but for the most part she was practically perfect in my eyes. No drugs, doesnt smoke, not a partier, doesnt drink unless socially and very family oriented. Eventually after high school i took a gamble and told her my feelings which she responded by sharing she had the same feelings for me. We started dating (in order to do so i had to basically destroy my life, story for a different time) and we were so inlove. I never felt so happy. Love making multiple times a day, every time our hands met i could feel goosebumps surging through my whole body. And that went on for about 10 months. Then we had a daughter. For the record i think being a father is the best thing i do in life. She is a great mother too. But down the road we started resenting each other. We knew we were essentially perfect for each other but our prides always made us butt heads. We started fighting so much our neighbors would complain about us over in the other apartment.Alot happened over the next few years like her cheating on me with my best friend aka her ex (once again anither time) but after a year breakup period we began dating again. We now have 3 kids. I dont kno if i truly ever knew the type of person she was but at this point she is so cruel its unbearable. I never met anyone more jealous in my life. Always asking me who im with and calling me every  10 minutes if i go out, thats if she ever lets me. Over 10 years of working at the same job she has created confrontation with atleast 70% of my female co workers, how im not fired yet because of it is beyond me. She gives me no respect and always talks at me instead of conversating with me. She loses her temper over very trivial bullshit and always end up screaming where our neighbors neighbors can hear. When she gets mad its like she forgets about our kids just becomes so cruel to the family, when she isnt in a bursting rage she is actually a great mother i must admit.I am def no saint but i always initially try to be respectful to her and talk to her and try to make us come to a solution to our arguments but never to any avail. I usually end up apologizing just to stop the usless fighting. 95% of our arguments essentially consist of me asking to be spoken to with respect and she overly upset about, i dunno, dirty dishes or laundry on floor or def about random women. Ive tried breaking up multiple times but she always threatens me with taking my kids from me or moving to a diff state or get about $800 in child support from me for every kid. She has done a few of these already in the past. She manipulates the courts so well and tbh im awful in court. (Btw i bring my daughters to school every morning and tuck them in at night. I need them in my life daily they r the only things keeping me from falling apart). Didnt mention this earlier but i always kept the relationship together in the beginning chapters cause i believe raising kids in one household like my parents did. Ive seen them fight and work it out so why couldnt i? Well thats what i use to think. So over time i gave her large assurances that i wanted to have a happly ever after and stop fighting. Our bank accounts are combined(she doesnt work), we have a 2015 nissan, we bought a house together in both our names. She basically has my life in her palm. Yet the fighting just keep getting worse. To the point we r both screaming at each other everyday.I feel like im steping on glass around her. She is upset about everything and anything. Shs says she hates me and wishes i was dead that i ruined her life daily. Tbh recently i met my breaking point and have been telling her the same. All i fight about is wanting her to talk to me calmy and with respect. Everyone we know thinks we r this perfect couple cause i always put on this front and we have so many successes.I recently started realizing im actually mad at myself for allowing myself to hand my life over so easily to another human being. My life is not my own but its honestly my fault. I now have a stable job, beautiful kids, great new car, amazing house and a family. I met all my goals i wanted in life and im so incredibly pained. I can not feel more sorrow then i do now. Im sad and hurt. This pain has become unbearable. Knowing im going to live the rest of my life like this or live in studio apartment barely seeing my kids for the rest of my life. I feel so depressed, i wanted to kill myself a few times but honestly i never would. Im to much of a pussy to do it and also ill never hurt my kids like that. But somtimes i just take a quick drive and breakdown so my kids dont see me sad. Im still that happy go lucky guy on the outside to everyone. But inside im in so much crippling sadness i can feel it physcially on my chest. Its embaressing, im a grown man  and all i want to do is fall on the floor curled up hoping somone would come save me. It saddens me deeply i might have to live another 40 years feeling the way i do now. It kinda feels like the time my grandma past away and i was so crushed. But this pain is amplified by 2 and i feel it everday, every hour.I dont think there is anything for me to do at this point but i was hoping writing this would relieve this swollen pain in my chest a bit.

I didn't have many friends in school and eventually I became used to being by myself. For the last few years I have absolutely loved my own company and still do many things alone. I've gone abroad many times by myself, had dinner watching the sun set over the mountains and have eaten at restaurants with my only company being street cats wanting food.  I'm now changing my life around and taking exams to get me on the path to my dream career.

116,"The ineternet has been my refuge, but lately there are two reasons I feel almost sick logging on. One is boredom: I'm bored. Nothing is interesting, and I just sit there reading or watching mindless things I happen across. I can't bring myself to use the internet for anything useful - I've thought about taking classes, but can't being myself to expend the effort, I don't know why.  The other is fear. That's the strangest and most bizarre. I'm coming down off some very odd obsessions, basically rejoining reality after a year or so. I mean, I'm usually off in some fantasy world, disconnected from what's going on in the world, but never so much as this. Along with coming out of that, I guess I've been trying to be more involved in the world, in life...and I end up overwhelmed. I never know what's true or not. There's argument and confusion around every corner on every issue. Ideals can't survive, or at least mine can't in the face of so many screaming that people like me are stupid and wrong. I don't know what to think, like, believe, want, or do. Some deeply held ideals and outlooks came close to dying - not because of evidence, so much, you can't really prove or disprove an abstract worldview. But just because of hearing so much to the opposite, I can't fight doubt. And yes, there are some other issues, trying to reevaluate beliefs, being wrong and feeling like more and more of a failure.And of course, that's to say nothing of constantly running into drama, bullying, the world going to hell (and being simultaneously inspired to do something, anything at all...and too empty and discouraged to bother) that I can't bring myself to look at it for very long. I hate myself for this - I feel like a coward, like I'm weak. I can try to tell myself at the very least I need a break from constant internal crises, time to recover and figure myself out again emotionally. In fact, I really like not logging on every day, or at least only occasionally. I feel so peaceful, if a bit bored, until I go online, then this sense of anxiety and emptiness sets it.

129,"First off, I'm not the most grammatically correct or articulate, so forgive me.My wife and I have been married for three years and together four, and we love each other dearly. She is 23 and was 19, still living at her step mom and dad's when we met. We dated for a while and she moved in. I was in college, but had a part time job good enough to keep us afloat, but barely. She had a myriad of problems that I learned about. All mental, such as depression, anxiety, etc. Her step mom didn't believe in doctors and refused to help her. A long story short, after all if these years, multiple doctors and a misdiagnosis of bipolar disorder, she finally has the right medication. She found a job a little over a month ago and it is a decent one. One that she can make a career out of, plus she enjoys it. This is the first job she's ever been able to hold and I couldn't be more proud of her. I had to transfer to a four year school and graduated last May. Since then I've been jobless. I can't find anything with my degree. Also, I've been very depressed for years and I've never been able to see a doctor foe myself. All of the money went to her doctors and medication. We simply don't have the money for me to see one anymore. All of these years I worked and worked to help her get to where she is. To help her get medicine, a vehicle, a career, an apartment, and a good life. She has worked her butt off and it payed off.But now I have nothing left. I'm depressed. So much so that I can't hardly force myself out of bed. I'm unemployed, student loans are piling, she is taking care of me and paying all of the bills alone. I have no motivation, no will, to do anything and we can't afford a doctor. We have one vehicle and there are no free or reduced cost clinics near us that are even worth it, as she went to the only one and we got her out of there fast. That place was awful. She is paying for everything, and if I wasn't here, if I left, she would financially fine. After all of these years she is finally self sufficient, and now I'm dead weight. I can't get out of my own head.She would actually have more money if I divorced her. If I left and tried to stay with my mom until I found some other job. My wife would be successfully without me, and I feel like a 25 year old bum. I simply can't do anything.

134,"I dont know if this is the right place to post this, but it is making me very depressed so I figured it was suitable. I am a maintenance worker at the retirement home my grandma lives at. I am 24 and I have been in the construction industry for a few years, so Im not new to the trades, but by no means do I know everything. I still have lots and lots to learn. A lot of people assume I got hired because my grandma lives here so it was a conflict of interest, but really it cant only be that, I am licensed and certified in heating and air, which is what they needed someone knowledgeable in his field in the maintenance department, so I demonstrated my skills in the interviews and I was hired. Anyway, I have worked here for about 10 months now, and there is this older Mexican man we will call him M, and M has worked here for around 8 Years and he is in his 40s and he is highly skilled and knowledgeable about anything construction or maintenance related. He is what is causing my depression. Instead of trying to teach me things when I cant figure something out he tells me figure it out on your own, thats how you grow up anyways. And he walks away. He says this so much so to the point where now I fear even asking for help because he talks down to me like this. It seems as though he is constantly trying to undermine me. I dont know why because I have always tried to be nice to him, nothing else. For example, this happened just yesterday on our lunch break. We have another third coworker in our maintenance department we will call him Q. Q is about 30 and he is much more skilled and knowledgeable than me, but no where near as much of an expert as M. Q has grown to become one of my bestest of friends over the past 10 months so much so that I would want him to stand by my side in my wedding next year. He always has my back, like I wish M did. Anyways, yesterday at lunch M said, I once got called in to work at 3am when I was on-call. And Q responded, What?! 3am?! Man, I have to go to sleep at some point so my phone is on silent at that point in the night. And, all I did was agree with Q and say that thats crazy. So Q has been working here for 3-4 Years so he is much closer with M and M doesnt try to undermine Q like he does me. So, M went to upper management and said that I said that I wont answer the phone after a certain time when Im on call because my phone is on silent and I want to sleep, when in reality I am not the one that said that, Q said it, M was just trying to undermine me and make me look bad to management. So, yesterday before I left work, management came to me and told me to remember you have to have your phone not on silent when you are on call in case there is an emergency and we need you here. You can get written up if you do not answer your phone and you are on call, because that means that someone else has to go in to cover for you when its your turn to be on call. I tried to explain myself that I was not the one that said that I was just really a by standard, but they really didnt believe me because M has been there for 8 Years and I have been here for 10 months of course they will have his back over mine. So I dont get what his problem is with me. M is constantly pulling things like this and micromanaging me and not helping me when I am trying to understand something new and need help. When I need him he is not there but when I dont need him he is micro managing me and undermining me. He is causing some serious depression in my life and I am considering quitting my job. What do you think I should do? Ive tried talking to him and management. I want this all to end and I really just want to quit, but this job is such a great job the benefits are not comparable to any other work place and the pay is amazing not to mention this is where my only living grand parent lives and I would hate to have to explain why I quit to her.

Meaning it wasn't supposed to help me feel better when a family member died or I went through a break up or was in a shitty job. I'm currently off of any medication, not because I'm doing better but because of other reasons and I've noticed something. I've had to relearn how to react to emotions. I've been so...blunted and dull for a year. For instance (the good) I find myself laughing at a lot more things. Like seeing something funny elicits more of an emotion than ""-heavy exhale- that's funny"" and ""touching"" things are effecting me more too but I'm also dealing with how to feel frustrated again.

I found my phone and saw a missed call and dialed that number thinking it could only be the police trying to reach me. The officer on the phone was very frustrated that I was feeling depressed and tried to ask for help. He sounded like he just wanted to have a squad car come to my apartment and arrest me. They actually did come to house, but I had already gone to work.

148,"(Sorry. May contain some grammar errors as English is not my first language)I met her when I was 8 years old. She's also from my hometown. We went to same school. Gradually we became friends. By the age of 14, I started considering her one of my two best friends. She was a genius girl and I was an average student. I can't exactly remember when I got the feeling 'she's the one for me', but it happened when I was around 16. She must have felt the same way. Suddenly our relationship got changed. The friend turned herself in to a shy girl around me. We became the 'unofficial couple', though I never asked her out.She was the bright, studious girl in our school, and I was not good at studies compared to her. I wanted to be a somewhat valuable boyfriend to her than just being an average guy. So I decided to work on my goals. I started focusing on my studies more than ever. I achieved first rank 5 times in the final 6 exams. We faced the Advanced Level exam (somewhat equal to the SAT in the US) She got selected to the engineering degree, but I wasn't lucky enough get selected for the medicine degree course. I wanted to get selected just to impress her. I worked as hard as I can, and got selected in the next attempt after an year.On the first day of medical school, I asked her out, and she said ""No""!I learned that she had found a boyfriend in the year I haven't been in touch with her.I was shocked hearing that. There isn't any fault of her, but I felt myself useless. I felt all my hard work went in vein. I may have overestimated myself. I wished her good luck and left.Since then my life has become a living hell. I determined not to interfere her relationship. I wanted get myself distanced from her.That happened two years ago. I still feel depressed. I have no interest in studies now. I continuously failed all subjects in the medical school, and missed two batches. Next exam is my last chance to survive, but I have no interest. I felt suicidal several times.I met my college psychiatrist last year, discussed with her about my lack of interest in studies and suicidal thoughts. But I avoided telling her about my friend as I felt uneasy with discussing it with her, and also it might become long and boring. She prescribed me 100mg dose of sertraline. After few months having breathing exercises and antidepressants my treatments ended.I tried to text her few times, but she doesn't seem to be interested in having a conversation with me. Most conversations are limited to few lines, and even for that she responded after days.I don't know what to do now. My best friend has become a total stranger for me now. She is getting her degree end of this year, and I am struggling to pass my first year exam.It's okay that I'm not a good option to be a good boyfriend, but I don't know why I lost her as my best friend. At least I just want to be around her. I have no target in my life as I had few years ago. I didn't let her know about my failures and treatments as she would think that I'm trying to gain sympathy.

160,"  Im in my early 20s trying to get my life together. My parents are divorced and i currently live my dad(whom i believe is a narcissist). For as long as i can remember hes never been there for me emotionally, yeah hes around for birthdays and some holidays but we never really bonded other than that besides the occasional movie.  Hes been engaged to different women 3 times and each one ended within a year due to his commitment issues which makes me sick but i think has made an impact in my dating life because i cant seem to hold a long relationship. He sends me to grab him food(including his girlfriend who is my age), drive my grandma around, and do house maintenance. I dont mind doing any of this, i understand i live under his house so i must abide by his rules but i feel like its a bit much. He sits in his office all day doing work and everything in the house is my problem. He even makes me babysit my sister for hours while hes working(which he did to me when i was younger) like he cant be bothered with watching her for more than a couple hours so he throws her at me or my grandma. My sister(3 years old) just cries the whole time cause he wont play/watch her(this is mostly on weekends, shes at her mothers on weekdays). Im afraid because of this my sister is going to end up the way i am with my father and end up resenting him in a way. I just feel used and like an object to him, and i cant talk to him about it because we just dont have that relationship. But i do get my privacy in this house which i love, Ive grown to isolate myself.  My mom on the other hand has remarried and has 3 girls that i love to death but honestly Im not that good with kids. My mother wasnt always there for me when i was younger but now that she has all these kids shes much better and really tries to talk an connect with my which i love.

165,"Im a full time college student, and today has honestly been a good day, for the record.   I got an offer to work as a tutor next semester, and I found out that next week I dont have to take one of my finals due to the fact that I had an A.  I have a new job that pays well, and every physical need in my life is taken care of.  In spite of that, last week I managed to get into hot water with my parents due to falling asleep in church and being generally ungrateful.  On my back to my apartment from their place, I fell asleep behind the wheel of my car and nearly ran it off the road.  The police stopped me, and thankfully didnt ticket me.  Up until today this week,  due to those events Ive felt like a spectacular failure.  Tonight, I went out with a group of friends from a recreational club for an end of the semester dinner, and I left early.   There were two reasons for this, the first being that I saw myself in the mirror again, and remembered how much weight Ive gained this semester from a poor diet and lack of exercise.   The second thing that caused me to want to leave was my inability to interact with anyone.  I saw a friend of mine and a girl that I had tried to date earlier in the semester really hitting it off, and everyone else at the table seemed to be laughing and enjoying each others company.  I just couldnt do it.   I dont know why I couldnt, because I really wanted to.  I wanted to be part of that, but I just cant be fun.  I think both my weight issues and social problems are both causes for my inability to find a partner, which is something thats bothered me since my freshman year of high school.  Even if I managed to get into shape, which I have no confidence that I will given how late I am in my life at this point, I just dont have the personality to keep someone else entertained and happy enough to stay with me.  I have a lot to be thankful for, so I think its wrong of me to even be complaining about this, but my parents and friends are probably sick of the whining.  I dont know who else to talk to right now.  ",1,-0.100000001,6.699999809,0.048700497,0.518651307,0.333490849,0.076747499,0.022409838

Things that are contributing to my depression:- I'm a 19 year old female studying full-time at my local community college, due to my inability to work because of my busy school schedule, my boyfriend (21) had to pick up a 50/hr a week job with a one hour commute in order to support us, So he's gone now for 14/15 hours a day 4 days a week, 16/17 hours if there is really bad traffic.

Nothing has worked. - I have no health insurance, constantly fearful that i'm sick or dying and have no idea. - Sometimes the only ways to get me out of suicidal thoughts is to place myself in a daydream where I have endless money and nothing to worry about, I find myself living in these fantasies more and more lately. - Constantly struggling with anxiety and body dysmorphia, I'm thin now, but can't stop seeing the zit riddled fat kid in the mirror. - I'm growing increasing terrified of where I live, Someone has been stealing my mail for the last month, a man was murdered on my street a few weeks ago, and a hole was shot in my window with a BB gun, my only form of security is my German Shepherd. - The ever growing thought that all of this can go away if I just kill myself, or attempt to go off-grid.

177,"But I want to share something that's fuckin me up.I got involved with a friend. We are very much alike and we've been attracted to each other for a while until we finally hook up. Now here's the deal: I have anxiety and haven't been able to talk to girls for a long long time, starting to get better just recently. This friend of mine was an exception to the rule and I was actually very open with her. After the first time we hooked up we were texting and I was panicking about her saying she liked that night and wanted to repeat, etc. I guess I feel a lot of pressure hearing this as if I've set some expectation that I can't live up to. So, since my brain was bailing out, I said maybe we shouldn't do it again so we could stay friends and don't ruin that. But I also said that it could happen if it was spontaneous (I guess this was a sane part of myself that knew I wanted it).Anyway, a lot of time went by and we hooked up again. The first time I was drunk and loose, but this time I was sober and it was absolutely great. We didn't talk about it for a while and when we did she told me she was seeing this guy that she really liked and whatever so, again we wouldn't be doing this regularly. But at that point we weren't thinking about doing it regularly, until one day we met and I was being too quiet and she noticed it. So without thinking I told her I really enjoyed kissing her and I wanted more. She had told me she feels very attracted to me and you liked to have me too. Stupid as I am, I told her I was confused because I couldn't see us as a couple and she agreed, but that wouldn't stop us from having a friends with benefits thing. Also she was still seeing that guy and all.As time goes by I begin to think more and more that we would actually be a great couple. We are the closest friends and we are sexually attracted, so why wouldn't it work? Now here's something I didn't know: a male friend we have in common actually hooks up with her occasionally too. I guess this shouldn't bother me since we never had anything serious, but man! Hearing him say they fucked was just a deep stab. And that just got me even more confused about how I feel towards her. I mean, I'm being jealous!I think I felt really disposable after knowing that I just another one of her friends that she uses for pleasure. But that thought doesn't add up to how we interact, me and her... I'm really confused.I had a lot more going on: not knowing what to do with my life, my anxiety got extremely worse to the point I can't eat anymore, I feel like my friends are drifting away and I have nobody to talk about anything, my family isn't the best... I also had a lot of suffering going on in my teenage years about love and relationships (friends included). Thanks thing with my friend was the final drop to release the tears I've been holding back for years.Today I woke up too early, shaking, feeling stomach pain and I just bursted in tears. I couldn't stop crying and I'm almost crying again while writing this.Sorry if it sounds like some bullshit drama, I really don't care right now, because I felt like I needed to get this out of my chest.Tl;Dr: I hooked up with a friend that hooks up with other friends and I got an avalanche of feelings added up to the feels soup. That made me wake up to cry, something I haven't done in years.EDIT: To be clear, that's a reeally compact version of what goes on in my brain.

The feeling is unrelenting and haunts me as I write this.After the depersonalization began the depression became clinical where it has since stayed. I don't talk much and making friends among the self-absorbed crowds of undergrads from So Cal is hard, harder than regulating my emotions or understanding Hofstadter's books. The counseling center recommended clubs, I have tried some of them but no one seems to be able to start a club at this school without a politically correct socially just white guilt approved awareness agenda, and you know, that stuff just doesn't really make me feel better about myself-- sorry.My peers feel like... other people. Everyone feels like other people. I just want to be friends with good people but it's hard cause the good ones are so BUSY being good and getting their lives together while I'm... getting by?

I've been hanging out with friends less and less, as my best friend started dating the girl he's been crushing on for years, so he's been spending the majority of his time with her, and the rest of my friends have been curving me recently to hang out with each other. Because of this, I have basically ended up staying in except for going to class, work, church with my family, and visiting my girlfriend. All of this has taken a toll on me mentally, which as only been worsened by the time of year for me. Winter brings on my SAD, and it also triggers a lot of memories of some of the worst times of my life. I've just been feeling like I have nowhere to go, nothing to do, and no one to talk to. My girlfriend is amazing, but I always feel as if my problems would just be a huge burden on her, and she already has enough stressing her out right now that I don't want to make it worse. I don't really talk to my parents about it because, like with my girlfriend, they already have enough to stress about without me making it worse. I haven't felt this terrible in years and I was just starting to feel like I had finally escaped my depression this last year as I entered college, but now it seems like it's back with a vengeance.

196,"Ill try to get right to the point with this. I suffer from depression, anxiety, and insomnia. I am alone most days and am pretty much confined to my bed, no school, work, or friends. Ive been seeing a therapist and considering different treatment, excluding medication, and have come to the realization that what I think is best for me is a support animal. I live in an apartment with my boyfriend and another couple who already have two dogs (max limit for animals stated in our lease) and another (secret) cat so I have been avoiding the idea of a support animal (trying to stay on good terms with landlord) until tonight. Tonight, in particular, was hard for me, sleep-wise, due to my boyfriend being sick and constantly getting up to vomit (tmi sorry). I finally was able to sleep after taking melatonin, but was woken by him several times and realized that I couldnt take it any longer (or the smell) and went to sleep on the couch. I realize that this is an asshole-ish move of me to abandon him while hes sick, but he does try to understand what Im going through and honestly, depression has turned me into a bit of a dick. Either way, I end up on the couch, unable to sleep, still, and start thinking those terrible thoughts (suicidal and all) about myself and my life that I always do and begin to feel INCREDIBLY alone. So alone, that Im almost to the breaking point, when I hear a door creak and see the cat hop onto the side of the couch and immediately run to my lap like she was sent from some Devine being to do so. I couldnt keep from bursting into tears. The immediate sense of relief that came over me was insane. She is still here by my side and hasnt left once since I started crying, but honestly I dont know if Id be here right now if she hadnt come..Anyway, Im thinking about suggesting a support animal as a kind of treatment to my therapist, but scared to do so because of how many people I know that have abused the system. I dont want to come off like that, but as bad as Ive been feeling lately, I want some sort of relief soon so I dont keep feeling like I had tonight before the kitty showed up.

213,"Hi, i never really saw myself doing this so it feels kinda weird to do.Since i was little i was left by both my mom and my dad.My dad left when he heard my mom was pregnant and my mom didn't wanted to take care of me so i had to live with my grandparents. I lived with (Only) them 7 years.Ever since that i always noticed things were not okay. Even when i was really small i was self-conscious of what was happening around me, i knew i did not had a dad, i knew my mom was mean (she would visit every now and then) and i knew my grandparents were just petting with me, treating me as a pet 'cause i was little, not because they actually liked me or wanted to spend time with me.Then things got better, we moved to a better house (An apartment) , my mom came back, i was happy for a little bit, that was until my mom left to live with one of her boyfriends, they would visit, when they were both drunk, and things like that, i remember once they took me to mcdonalds, when i came back i went to my room to show my mom one of my toys and when i came back she had already left with her boyfriend, she ran away from me.The same christmas of that year, i put a chemistry kit on my list, when it came i was super excited and happy, it was like my biggest wish, her boyfriend saw i was super happy and that my mom wasn't even paying attention to me and he said; i think i'm gonna leave, and my mom got mad at me she said i wish you were never born and she ran with him.Again, i was alone.one more year passed and i would see my mom once every month or something like that.She had a fight with her boyfriend, he cheated on her and i found myself on the middle of a house full of fights between her and my grandma, police had to come to separate them like 5 times... At that point i was just questioning why, i would cry on my pillow, or just try to forget about the situation, but the beef would always get to me and they would get me involved in some sort of way, once my grandma was trying to trow a knife at my mom and i jumped to try to get in the middle of it, i couldn't stop it, fortunately it didn't hit her but it was very traumatic to see all of those things happen.I was always bad at paying attention, all of those things made me just daydream a lot or just develop lack of attention to most of things.Although that... I always wanted to learn, i liked it, i could always get used to most of things without having to study them, just by practicing.After that it was just constant fights, every day for the next 5 years.I wanted a good school?No, go to a bad one.I wanted a good computer so i could play games?No, go outsideI wanted to go outside with some friends to some cool place?Nop, too expensiveI got to the point where my mom just sent me to a saturday highschool saying we can't afford a regular one aaand then she would buy fancy boots and clothes and go out, and everything, at that point i had to buy clothes from garage sells and she would get hers at the fanciest places at mall. I was always alone, i never talked to them since i didn't really felt comfortableThey would always treat me bad, make fun of me for saying an explanation, they would talk 'about a certain topic, and i would say oh yeah, it works like that, and they would say; no it works like this (nonsense) and they would make fun of me for getting the right answer, sometimes they would say is there something you don't know? mocking me and telling me to shut up.I tried different things, to accept my life, to just try to be like them, not to talk to them, everything... I just couldn't do anything.Right now i'm working and on college.And my mom wins x20 as me.I told her i needed help with college and i wanted to move somewhere else, since mxico does not have the best colleges and is not the safest place. She's just staying here because of some mxican guy she likes, sad thing is she doesn't even know him, it's a whatsapp boyfriend she met at some bad group of her work, he lives 12 hours away and he's cheat on her twice with her knowing 'about it. I tried to explain i always accepted everything and never complained, but i just needed help to find a better college; and she told me: No, stop telling me what to do, leave me live my life, i tried, i told her how i felt, how i wanted to get out of this country and she would just make fake jiggles, at some point i just couldn't contain myself, i was crying, i was not letting her get out of the door since she always does the same, she walks away and ignores me. she was pushing me and telling me i was crazy and worthless putting her face like 5 cms away from mine it's your problem, it's your problem then i said i'm your son, please help me you can't put a guy you just met 6 months ago before meand she jiggled hard on purpose, i got carried away and i did the movement of pushing her face away but did not touch her, she did a suprise noise and she was gonna start fake cry like she always does (she did that when she used to fight her mom numerous times) but then she noticed i didn't touch her so she did a dumb face and she keep repeating the same. The feeling of her trying to make me feel bad by fake crying, lying to me, laughing about her ruining my life just got me really mad, and i pushed (again not hit)  her face away, she did this horrible fake cry again and played offended for a bit, then afterwards she ran to her mom and dad's (Oh yeah, she's too bussy drinking and buying gucci boots to buy her own house) And she started telling her mom he hit me, he punches womans, he's so mean when all i wanted was her not to say those things in front of my face 'cause they were really really hurting me.3 days before this happened my grandma almost died, she drank a lot of pills, i had to break the door and go through a bathroom window to save her, when they came home they were acting like if nothing was happening, and my grandpa did not wanted to take them to the hospital, i got mad because it was a bad scenario, she was super bad, and he told me something like shut the fuck up you dumb shit I replied with What are you gonna do if i dont? he tried to scare me but as he saw i was not scared he said ok, remember this He's been treating me even worse than he used to.When this happened he came and told me to get out of his house, and that i was a worthless idiot.And now i feel bad and guilty because of that, because i would never ever solve problems with violence, i feel like the worst piece of human being.i just don't know what to do anymore, i've always felt bad 'bout my life,but i've always had hope on one time i'll go to college and i'll make my family proud but they don't even want to help me with that, i can't afford a private college on my own, and public colleges on here don't really give you much, i'm not learing anything and it's only valid on mxico,plus paying for transport is not that cheap on here, i can't even afford food. I've never talk about everything from the past with anyone, there's more, a lot more, but i just don't want to spend 3 hours trying to explain... I've always had hope, but now...

220,"At this point, I just have to laugh at the situation. It's good comedy. Someone's having a good fucking laugh up there.As may be the case with some of you, depression makes me extremely cognitively slow whilst at work. I do this thing where I sort of zone out when I'm forced to endure something I hate. I appear to be present to everyone around me, but consciously I'm really only half-there. I daydream. I've done it my whole life. I can't help it - it's as if it's an automatic defence mechanism. Through school and college and all of the jobs I've had, this has caused me problems.Now, as a 24-year-old man, I'm working as a waiter in a hotel restaurant. I haven't been there long and I don't plan to stay. I don't get on with anyone. All of the staff are quite a bit younger than I am and do not want anything to do with me. I have no self-esteem and I'm absolutely terrified of social interaction. I can't do anything to change it, so I just have to accept it. It's not how I want to be, but that's how it is. I keep my head down, and I don't bother anyone and I get treat like shit in return. I try my best to be content with that, but honestly, it's fucking awful.Very recently, this girl began to focus on me a little bit. It started with her just getting in my face and saying ""hiya"" in a stupid tone, in a blatant attempt to make me feel uncomfortable in front of the other staff. I don't know how to react to that. It did make me uncomfortable. Everyone's looking at me and expecting something back, but I just can't produce anything. I stand there and take it and desperately try to make it appear to have had no effect.Now it's at the point where she'll openly mock me in a room full of people whilst they all laugh. It's relentless. She'll tell people how slow and boring I am. I'll be called a ""fucking retard"" multiple times a day, she'll throw food in my hair and I'm pretty sure one time she spat in my lunch. It might sound like playful work banter, but it's not. And now a few others are joining in.With no one else to talk to, I told my mum about what was happening. It wasn't an easy conversation to have, and she couldn't decide whether or not I was being serious. ""So, a seventeen-year-old-girl is giving you shit at work? There must be something else the matter with you, that can't be it.""She seems to think that the bottom line of my problem is my ego. She says that only an ego is bruised by what people say. ""Ignore your ego, and you'll be fine.""To be honest, she's right. If I had no ego, none of this would bother me. Maybe I should just accept that I'm a little bitch who's terrified of talking to people. A man with nothing going for himself. Someone who'll never meet anyone, never have kids, and never be content with his life. Someone who deserves all of the shit that other people give him. Maybe that's who I am, and who I'll be until the day I die. If I accept that then none of this will hurt anymore.Sounds like a plan?",1,-0.300000012,18.39999962,0.084731408,0.545082152,0.185223669,0.131659627,0.053303145

It all started when girl rejected me and i fall apart and givedup on my life, i just don't want to live since then. When i see couples holding hand i just start crying and something hurts inside me and i think in my mind ""This guy, what a life, what he done he lives it like it, he must be living a dream""(I'm a man to be exact 22) I never had any close relationship i have no friends not a single one to meet and spend time with.

I can't sleep at nights i all the time go to sleep at 12PM and actually fall asleep at 4-5AM, in these hours i keep thinking how shitty my life is,none cares about it parents dont give a fuck even tho they know about that i have it. Now about the nights, i keep thinking about how wonderful it would be to have a girl to hold Her hands, to kiss Her, to talk to Her spend my whole life with Her give it to Her all of it, love as none else can, cry from happiness everytime i see Her, and most importantly hugs, thats my biggest dream of them all, to feel Her, Her body someone else touching me, actually feeling that i exist, someone do fucking care about me in this world i would hug Her deeply with pure love without faking it at all, then i sqeeze in my bed crying out loud and hugging my cover really hard like its Her. My dear love i will never have. Why? every time i see a girl i think 3 ways, either she must be in relationship already its worthless to try talk to Her, other way; Oh my She's so pretty and i keep staring at Her deeply with my ""love stare"" and they usually stare as well and it usually ends becouse of bus stops or something, last one, the worse of them all, at the beginning i already think ""Nah, she will reject me anyway im worthless and shit, not even worth a try"" Here is my story, deep down inside i have that feeling that a Girl that would love me as much as i love Her would cure my depression.

The second time I went to bed crying after cutting and took about 3000 mg of my medicine. I don't think I'll ever forget the day. I woke up to a splatting noise. At first I ignored it but then I saw a little spider on my bed and freaked out. I flicked it away quickly but kept hearing splatting noises. Eventually I realized the spiders were dropping from my roof onto my bed and got out of bed instantly, threw everything in the wash machine, and tried playing games. But I noticed that I couldn't focus no matter how hard I tried. Everything blurred together and I couldn't keep track of anything I was doing. It kinda sucked because I had a league tournament that day and lost for my friends. But after I have up trying to play games, I went to make tea. My vision was going like crazy. Everything that was far away got closer and farther as I walked, and close things went farther. So sometimes is try grab onto something just to find out it's actually really far away and fall. My legs were also shaking to the point that they couldn't support me. First found out when I collapsed and banged my head. I went around the house on my knees and hands because I also needed to feel where things were since my vision was messed up. I would feel around and then slide in that direction. My heart was really heavy and rapidly beating too so I had a constant feeling of anxiety and panic. But after I made my tea and slowly crawled back downstairs, I just layed on the couch.

239,"The suicidal thoughts are not the worst part of the situation Ive been in for the last eight years. Nor is the Crohns disease. Or the anxiety. Or even the depression in general. It is the all-encompassing, soul-crushing loneliness that I feel all the time, every single day, that makes it all unbearable. I just want to be loved. To be listened to. Cared for. I just want someone to give me a hug. To tell me I matter and mean it. And yet, if even if I get those things (which is rare), its not enough. Its never enough.

247,"I've never gone to anyone for help or advice in my life because I've never felt like I had someone to go to so this is awkward for me and I want to keep it short, so this isn't going to be some long story just some sentences that do something I guess. (this part is a lie, I couldnt stop writing)I've always felt like my mom didnt care about me as much as my siblings. She's always saying I'm going to get rich one day and buy her a house and ingrained that into my brain as a child. As I grew older (now 15) I realized more things like that. I'm the only one of my siblings that actually has REAL chores, she always makes her problems my problems, and since I was a kid I've always felt the need to impress her. As I got older I couldn't keep up with her expectations as now I'm always in my room and keep to myself which shes always feels the need to throw in my face. When I cant keep up with my chores she always tells me how lazy and useless I am even though I'm the only one out of my two siblings that do anything. I will never forget one night when I came home from school and was just so exhausted that I went to sleep. Apparently while I was sleeping she told me to take down the laundry and do it (I have my own laundry basket and that basket she was referring to was the bathroom laundry) obviously I was unconscious and couldnt hear her. So at about 8:00 when she sees the basket still in the hallway, she burst into my room and starts yelling at me about how worthless I am and how I cant even do the laundry, she asked why did she even have children when they cant do anything. I get great grades, I do my homework, I keep my room clean, I try to keep up with my chores, but if I screw up just once, she lets me know. It got to the point where I would genuinely be scared when I heard her steps in the halls because I thought she was going to yell at me about something I didnt do.2016 she told me we were moving to a new town despite how much I begged her not to. She was stressed and took it out on me every time reminding me how little I did. On my birthday she didn't get me any gifts which I didn't see as much a problem because I understood she needed the money for the move, but she had the money to buy my brother an Xbox One just a few months later. For Christmas she spent at least $80 each on my siblings while I had a $20 PSN gift card hanging on the tree, I don't know why it didn't bother me at the time but looking back on it sucks. I know it's just materialistic things and I dont really care for those things anymore, but treat you children equally.A year later now that we were in a much better financial situation and moved into a new house I assumed everything would get better which it kinda did. She didn't burst out yelling at me as much but it still happened time to time. So now that my 15 birthday was coming up I wasn't really excited and I didn't know why. I felt awkward asking for anything just because over the years I didnt really receive much. I just generalized thing I would have liked to receive but nothing specific. When my birthday came around I once again didn't receive a gift. I thought it was going to be a surprise or something simple like going to a restaurant or something so I waited. The next day, nothing, maybe one more day? Nothing. And as days turned to weeks I realized I wasn't going to get anything. It may not seem like a big deal but when you see your siblings receiving things all the time and you get nothing, it really sucks. For a while I blamed myself thinking it was my fault for not being specific enough, but come on, at least buy your kid some McDonalds or something, anything at all really. What really got me pissed though was just the next week, she took my sister shopping and spent $150 on clothes while I'm sitting here with the same 8 outfits I've had since 8th grade. Since then I learned if you never ask for anything, which I never do, you'll never owe anyone anything, so hey I guess it's a bit of a learning experience?For a few months after that I tried not to care, and I cant describe it in words because this was years of being kicked down over and over again (metaphorically btw, she never hit me), so eventually you learn that if you dont care about somebody, they cant hurt you. This worked for a while but it was obvious to everyone in the house that I was being cold. I wouldnt talk or eat much, I'd NEVER ask for anything from anybody and I still dont to this day no matter what it is. Her one sided yelling at me turned into mutual arguments. She never realized how many times I walked into my room and just cried. I'd cry in the middle of the day and continue like nothing happened, I'd cry in the morning just before I got out of bed, I cried myself to sleep. I was crying because I knew how much I was being physiologically fucked and there was nothing I could do about it, this is how I will be my whole life, I wont get the chance to experience of feeling loved.One day after some stupid argument I went into my room and cried like usual but this time I didnt close my door and she came in. She said that she was going to kill herself. In the moment I hated myself for being a terrible child, like it was my fault, like I was the bad guy, I felt like shit, but now that I had time to sit and think about it, HOW THE HELL are you going to tell your child that it's THEIR fault that you want to die?? That ate me up for weeks and now not only was my mom putting me down, I was putting myself down. I've learned that if you put a smile on your face and pretend your happy, nobody will question why your sad. I do this all the time and I dont even try anymore, it's just an instinct to smile in every and any situation.Quick side story shortly after we moved into the house. We got a dog. She loved the dog when her boyfriend (technically my stepdad at this point) was around. She used to take out her anger on er boyfriend all the time and I was always the ONLY one in the house who would defend him, she used to get mad when I did but I couldnt help it, I understood exactly how he felt. Eventually they decided to take a break from each other because too many arguments and he moved to Florida for the winter. I didn't realize how much I cared about the guy but when I heard he left I was extremely sad. Now with him gone, she turned to the dog. If you dont want to continue on I understand, skip the next paragraph because it gets really messed up.This is the part where my ""not caring"" turned into hate. First she moved the dog from her room to the basement. A couple of times he would poop in the basement because we were at school and couldnt take him out obviously. She would build up anger for days and wait for the perfect excuse (the dog poop) for a release. She hit the fucking dog, not once, not twice, but every god damn time he pooped. It wasnt even discipline I was just her releasing anger. This truly fucking broke me. I was ok with her yelling at me, but the dog, he's defenseless, she was just pure evil. It got to the point where she build a wall of all the junk we had in the basement to lock him in a corner so he wouldnt poop anymore. I'm shaking just writing this part. I can tell you that it happened a lot when I was in the house, but I cannot tell you how much that dog when through when I was at school. One day when I heard her hit him from my room and hearing his whimper I just couldnt take it anymore, I ran downstairs and we got into one of the biggest arguments ever, which ended with her saying ""I'm the mother of this house, if you have a problem, you can move to the streets and see how long you last"" I moved him to the front porch with a little cardboard house, his bed, and his toys, she wouldnt go in there because she was scared there were mice.He eventually got ticks and lime disease and after taking him to the vet after my sister begged her, she didnt allow him in the house anymore and he couldnt stay outside as much like he used to. He needed extersize, he was a growing dog. One day, he broke a screen in the porch and got out into the woods overnight. He was attacked by a porcupine and had the quills in his nose. We took him to a vet but because my mom didnt want to pay she left him there. The vets saw how sad I was when we left and called her and said we could have him back, she said no. She PROMISED me that she would tell me about what was going to happen to him but yet I heard this over a phone call she had with a friend a week later. How can I trust anyone, when I cant even trust my own mother? I never told her I knew. She took away my family when we moved to a new state, she took away my friends when we moved to a new town, she took away the closest thing I had to a father figure I've had in years, and now she took away my dog. I guess it was for the best, hopefully he has a better home.Just a couple months later (present day) we are moving again. She acts like it's a surprise we cant afford the house despite the fact that I did the math and told her 2 years ago that we wouldn't be able to. The stress has gotten to her again and guess who shes been taking it out on. The reason I made this is because an hour ago she told me she doesnt care about me. I've been thinking about posting this forever now so here it is. I know in the beginning I said it was going to be short but I kinda just started writing and well look what I've gone and did. I was going to ask for help but writing this and sharing it for at least someone else to see has felt good enough.

254,"This will be really long & I don't expect anyone to actually read it but I truly have never had anyone to talk to about my depression and just need to get it all out there for once. So basically my depression started when I was like 10. I was very close to my grandparents and my grandpa died that year and it literally shattered my whole world. On top of this loss, my mom was married to a man who treated me terribly and was very verbally abusive. I absolutely HATED my life during this time and remember having suicidal thoughts when I was in junior high. Eventually when I was in high school they got divorced and things got better for a while. I still went through depressive episodes but I wasn't miserable all day, every day like I was when I was around my step dad. And then my mom left. So I was 16 and my mom started dating this guy she met on Facebook.... she told me & my brother that she was going to visit our grandma for the weekend and never came home. She called like 2 weeks later and said she had gotten married to this new guy, got a new job and they had gotten a place together. All in a town several hours away from the one where we lived. I took this very hard. I felt abandoned by both my parents (my dad was still in the picture but also moved to a town several hours away as soon as he and my mother divorced. He was in a previous marriage and had a son, who was also in a crappy situation. He fought in court for the rights to my brother and raised him on his own. I always felt like I didn't matter as much as my brother, because my dad knew what I was going through and how badly my step dad was treating me but didn't even try to get custody of me.). I felt like I wasn't good enough. It made no sense to me. Mothers are supposed to love their children unconditionally and have a special bond with them, so I didn't understand how mine could just up and leave me and not think she did anything wrong. After about 6 months of being incredibly hurt and depressed, like bawling every single night, I eventually just got pissed off at my mom and wanted nothing to do with her. My last years of high school I lived with just my brother, since both my parents moved away and left me since it was convenient for them. My brother is great and I loved living with him, but I still kept getting sad for what felt like no reason. My mom used to take Cymbalta and left like 5 bottles of it behind when she bolted, so I started taking those myself. I also started developing a lot of anxiety around this time and would take them when I felt anxious. They made me feel really sick so I eventually stopped, I don't even think they did anything for me. Same story when I moved away for college the next year. I would feel happy sometimes and then just sad for no reason. As bad as it sounds, I would sometimes wish I would get cancer or someone I loved would get killed just so I would have an actual reason to be sad. I also felt really guilty about leaving my brother. I know he genuinely didn't care, but I would cry and cry over it. I felt like he was the only person in my life who had never walked out on me, and then I walked out on him. After my freshman year of college, I transferred to a school 8 hours away. I really struggled to make friends my first semester and was depressed pretty much the entire time. Developed a binge eating disorder and gained like 30 lbs. Toward the end of the semester I started getting really bad about attending class, but was able to end up with decent grades because I had been going in the beginning. The next semester, I joined a sorority and I had a great experience. I made a lot of friends really quickly and was really happy for a while. Then over the summer, I stayed in my college town to work and go to summer school. I became friends with the people I worked with and started hanging out with them regularly too. There would still be the occasional night that I would get really sad and just want to stay in and sleep or cry, but it was less frequent. The fall semester of my junior year, I was a mess. I never went to class. I was in 2 regular classes and 2 online and I ended up just dropping both regular classes because I was failing them. So at that point I was only a half time student. I still had a lot of friends and was having fun, but was getting less and less motivated in school.That spring, my depression started taking over my life. I never went to class but I also always made excuses to not hang out with my friends. I would sleep all day long and stay up all night. I was binge eating again and it was worse than before. I would go through fast food lines and get 2 meals and eat both of them in my car so my roommates wouldn't see how much food I was eating. I hid my binge eating and depression from everyone. We had an on campus counseling center and every day I would lay in bed crying thinking about how much I needed to go there, but I could never get the courage to actually go. School was stressing me out so much and I didn't know how to handle it. I wouldn't go to class because I was depressed, then I would fall behind and school which would stress me out, then I would think about how much I fucked up my school life and would get even more depressed. At the very end of the semester I got out of my funk and somehow managed to get my shit together and pass my classes. I lied to and manipulated my professors to do it, but I did. I was also in a small major and all of the same people in my major were in ALL my classes. I did not fit in with them at all and hated them so much. I had no friends in my major and they were all rude/mean to me during class and group projects. I ended up switching majors to get away from those people. So again after that, things started getting better. I was aware of my depression so even though there were nights I didn't want to go out with my friends, I would force myself to just because I knew I would be sad later if I didn't. I also stopped binge eating, but had already gained another 30 lbs at this point. I hated the way I looked but didn't care enough to change it. By my last semester of college, I felt like I had things back under control. I was doing well in school and I was with my friends constantly. I hung out with them every chance I got because I knew this was the last time I was going to live in this town with all of them. I finished school and all was well. I was also interviewing for my literal dream job. I had applied in November and done 3 interviews for it by the time I graduated. It was a super competitive position and a lot of people applied for it, so I never even expected to make it to the first interview. I made it all the way to the final interview which was in February, and then I didn't get the job. I was literally crushed and felt like a complete failure. It was miserable to make it so far and then not get it. And then things have consistently nose dived since. I got into grad school in another state and originally planned on moving there. I wasn't too worried and figured I would make friends there and life would be okay again. My entire program can be completed online, so I let my family talk me into living at home. By this point my dad had retired from his job and he moved back to our hometown and so I lived with him since my mom was still gone. I HATE my hometown. It's super small, almost everyone here is racist, trashy, uneducated and just overall shitty. I had like 3 friends by the time I finished high school and they all either have babies or are in & out of prison- or both. I've tried hanging out with them a few times, but it's just so awkward because I've changed so much since high school. We took such different paths in life that I can't even relate to them anymore. Before I even applied to grad school, I was told it would take me a year to finish if I went full time and over the summer. Well turns out that's not true. The earliest I'll be able to finish is May 2019. Which means I have to live here another year and a half, on top of the past year I've spent in this shit hole. I cannot find a job here. I'm either overqualified or under-qualified for everything. I've even applied for shitty, minimum wage retail jobs and I haven't even gotten a call back. I've applied at at least 50 places in the past year and can seriously not get an interview from anyone... I don't understand what these people want. I have experience, I have education, I'm not a criminal. Idk why I can't get a job. And I feel like a loser because I don't work. I don't technically need a job because I don't have rent or bills since I live at home, but I have worked all through college and even had 2 jobs every summer since high school so I feel useless without one. And I feel like I'm disappointing my family. They keep telling me to get a job and I feel like they don't believe me when I tell them I've applied at all these places. My aunt even said I was just lazy once which really hurt my feelings. I've barely left my house or interacted with anyone I'm not related to in the last year. I just sit at home all day long on my laptop or sleep. I'm insanely bored and feel so isolated and lonely. I keep going in and out of really bad depressive states where I'm not taking care of myself and literally sleeping for like 16 hours a day. Things have ONCE AGAIN, been looking up. I started putting some effort into losing weight back in October and have lost 18 lbs since. I still have a lot left to lose, but the weightloss has given me something to work toward and look forward to. But I've started developing anxiety about my future. I've never had to be a ""real adult"" and I'm terrified I won't be able to find a job once I finish school. If I do, I'm scared I'll struggle financially and that will just trigger my depression more. I'm also 23 and I'm a virgin who's never been in a serious relationship. I had ""boyfriends"" in high school but they only ever lasted a few weeks and they were never anything memorable. I haven't kissed anyone since 2013... which was 4 years ago. I used to not be fat and didn't have trouble attracting guys, but I was super awkward around them so I never developed any relationships. Then once I started gaining weight, guys stopped paying attention to me. A lot of my friends are starting to get married and I just feel like I'm never going to be able to find love. I'm going to be 25 by the time I finish grad school and I don't even want to consider anyone from my hometown for a relationship. So I'll most likely not even look for a boyfriend until I move somewhere else. So I'm going to be a 25 year old virgin with literally no experience beyond kissing who has never been in a relationship. I feel like even when I lose the rest of my weight I will never be able to establish a good relationship with anyone because my inexperience is a turn off. Or if I do I feel like I'll be like 35 by the time I get married and too irrelevant in all my friends lives to even have bridesmaids. I'm writing all of this because I'm currently in a depressive state brought on by feeling excluded and unwanted by my college friends. I've REALLY struggled the last year adjusting to life after college and I feel like none of my friends have been there for me or even noticed or thought to ask. I was so close to these people whenever I lived in the same town as them and now that I'm gone it feels like I'm old news. I have one group of best friends and all 6 of them are currently in Las Vegas without me to celebrate one of their birthdays. I saw the bday girl posting about going to vegas on Twitter and commented on it, and was ignored totally. Then a week ago she texts me and invites me because someone else dropped out. Apparently she wanted to invited me but didn't have enough room in their Air BnB. I asked my family but they said it was too expensive so I couldn't go. Now they are all there and I keep seeing how much fun they're having while I'm laying alone in my bed crying and it just hurts so much. It hurt my feelings a lot that I was excluded and then only invited as a last resort. And it isn't even because I moved away, because 2 other girls in the group graduated and moved too and they were both invited. I'm literally the only one who was left out. And I don't understand why. Why me? Why am I the weakest link? Why am I always the one left out? It's even more frustrating to me because I'm constantly still doing things for my friends and sending them notes and gifts. I always put so much thought, effort and money into doing things for them even though I'm 8 hours away and I haven't ever gotten anything in return. I don't think I've had a single friend buy me a birthday gift, ever. Idk. It just makes me feel like I always care more about people than they care about me. Being the ONE person left out kind of justifies my depressive and anxious thoughts about being a burden on people or an annoyance to them. I feel so alone, so sad, so worthless and so miserable. I don't know if I can handle another year of this but I don't even know what I can do. I feel like all my life things have kept getting better then worse then better then worse again and that it'll never change.

I've tried and tried to get over my dry spell and can't seem to do it. I thought getting a job and graduating would help, but nope. I thought changing my wardrobe wearing fitted clothing, and changing my hair style would help, but nope. Recently I got a puppy and thought it would help, but nope... (Note: I always wanted a puppy anyway, but still) I'm so miserable about it because I've come close, but either one thing or another it will not happen.

I first questioned it when Robin William died because while my jokes would never be comparable with the ones Robin told; I saw myself like him where I like to make other people happy by laughing and a person like that I thought would never have those thoughts on his mind until his death. Another thing was I thought my general sadness was from the fact that I was without a girlfriend in high school;it almost became the reason for my existence and once I got one in senior year,nothing changed at all.

I told myself the feeling would go away after a good one because the last one was just a fluke but thinking now,I wouldnt get back together with my ex,no SO would just magically pull me from this. The last thing was when one of my friends started posting on Snapchat about her problems and I talked with her about it and I notice a difference between us; after like two days she dropped the stuff she was talking about and hasnt mention it since. Its been like a month or two and the only things she sends now are her out and about and with her friends. I on the other hand has been feeling like this since 6th grade and while I have moments where I dont think of it;it always comes back after that 10 second or 2 minute time is up. I never hope I would ever say I was depressed for attention either so I only told my mom,brother and my best friend from high school who thought it was funny which enforces the notion I wasnt really but then again reddit is a popular site where something on r/all has more upvotes than people I dare know in my lifetime so idk what Im really aiming for here. In reality my family and friends and my lack of courage might be the only reason why Im here right now but then again my friends would never believe I was truly depressed and my brother thinks Im just going along with trends that depression is edgy or the kill myself jokes similar to like me_irl which its hard to tell if its just jokes or jokes made in denial. I have never try to kill my self but theres been many occasions where I discarded my safety with my fingers cross that something would happen but my family and friends would never know about that its too small to remember. Theres also a stigma against mental illnesses which brother flat out admits its hard to believe someone close to him has but I seen a stat that 1/4 American has a mental illness of sorts and my nuclear family has four people and my parents and brother are normal in the head which honestly is the weakest part of my argument;but Ill call it an argument because I actually believe I am depressed but everyone else disagrees and its hard to decide who to listen to because who should understand my mind better than myself but then again I never really value my input/opinion to begin with.

294,"It's been 10 years. I was 15 when I first got depression. And for years and years, I fought it and tried to have a normal life. I fought so hard to work full time, go to university, support my SO. But I kept falling short, having mental breakdowns, and leaving jobs. I finally decided today that I'm going to stop fighting it.No, I'm not going to kill myself. I'm going to accept that my life might never be the normal life I've always wanted. I'm going to be moving to a smaller house. I'm in a casual work position so that I can work as much or as little as my depression and anxiety will let me. My SO is going to be getting a respectable promotion, and has agreed to become the breadwinner (so long as I use my spare time to keep myself as happy as I can.) I don't know what that means yet, but it could mean anything. Volunteering. Art. Music. Dog walking. Writing. Music lessons. Anything to help me from feeling like hurling myself off of a bridge.I know what a lot of you are thinking. ""Fuck this guy. He just gets to do whatever he wants to because he has someone to help support him."" Or, ""You can still do things you enjoy? You must have it easy."" Well, this isn't what I want. And maybe I can still do things I enjoy sometimes, but that doesn't change the running suicide commentary going through my head.  I want to go to work. I want to make lots of money and have a nice house. I want to be respected as a hard working person who contributes to society.  But my brain just isn't letting me. And as stupid as it sounds, I still think that the standard 40 hour work week with kids and a nice house is a waste of a good life...like I'm sure a lot of you think. But I still want it at the same time. It's funny how depression can make you feel like that. I don't want to be like everyone else, but I also do.Oddly enough, my SO is the exact opposite of me. She can't handle being at home on her own. Her depression explodes. She used to work in a seasonal trade, and would completely shut down when she was off in the winter. She breaks down when she's home alone on her days off. She has to be with friends, or doing something with me. It's kind of disgustingly perfect in a way. A lot of you are probably still snarling at me for having a seemingly great situation, but I can assure you that I'd love nothing more than to pluck this screaming illness from my head and move on. I don't like being suicidal every day. I don't like having crippling hypochondria. I don't like being scared to go into public. This is my nightmare, but I'm going to do my best with it.Part of me is relieved that I'm finally just accepting it and doing what I can, but part of me is absolutely distraught that it had to come like this. I feel like the special kid who could only come to class a couple days a week because he wasn't physically able. Except I feel like I'm worse because it's all in my head. I fucking hate it. But it's the only thing I can do right now.So yeah, I'm pretty damn lucky that I have this option. To work as I can. Of course, it comes with certain sacrifices. But I still have the option. It's weird though, because up until now, I thought ""man up and live like everyone else"" or ""kill yourself"" were the only two options. I guess I only have my SO to thank. That being said, I've had a tough couple of months, but dedicating half of my time to enjoying life, doing therapy, and learning new things has made the tough days worth fighting through. I'm letting the depression win, but I'm also boxing it in with the tools I have available to me. To be quite honest, if I didn't have my SO, I'd likely be doing this out of my parents basement. Or dead. But I'm using what I have.It's sobering and heart breaking to admit that you're a lost cause, but it can also be liberating. Heck, I might turn 30 and lose this depression all together, as unlikely as it is at this point, but for now I need to build my life around it. Because the other way was not working.I know not everyone is in the situation I'm in and that the world isn't built for people with brains like us, but I want to encourage everyone who has an idea in their head of what they wish their life would look like to try and come to terms with the fact that maybe you need to build a new life around what you have available to you. I spent every year since High School desperately trying to fit into this mould of a standard citizen, a mould that I HATED, but felt pressured into. Well guess what? That's never going to happen for me and I'm ok with it now. And I'm willing to do whatever it takes to adjust my life to it. I'm sure a lot of you are already past this stage too. Sitting in your parents basement or on social assistance. Or maybe even in my position. As to where we go from here, I'm not sure. But we can be there for each other at the very least.

306,"(Disclaimer: This is essentially a rant. You probably won't care. I just need to talk somewhere, this is mostly a bunch of mindless babbling and complaining.)I'm not living the life I should, and I don't know what's wrong with me. I always get myself into fights I don't want to. I've inadvertently ruined friendships so badly that it sabotaged my reputation. I can't make or keep friends well and I've heard people only pretend to like me. I know I'm a fat lazy shit, everyone tells me so. I want to turn my life around, I really do. I just have zero motivation. I yell about how I want to go to the gym and get in shape. Guess how that's turned out. I say I want to go out more, but do I reach out to anyone to hang out? Not at all. I depend on my fake ass 'friends' to reach out to me (which happens about once in a blue moon). When I do go out, I totally lose control and act like a moron because the rest of my time is spent alone. I always end up wanting to go home within a few hours, and then crash hard. I'm probably just an introvert in denial, but it's the only time I feel truly alive. All I do is sit inside and masturbate and play video games and eat. I may leave the house once for some non-necessary (ie. not school or related things) once, maybe twice, and that's a good week.It doesn't make sense because I'm not always sad. Sometimes I'll go days at a time feeling fine, but then drop hard and spend the next couple days in a pit. It's practically a cycle. My feelings seem to manifest themselves as anger and hostility, I'll snap at people for damn near anything and need to control myself to ensure I don't. I pick fights I shouldn't. Yet despite this, I have low self esteem (yet, as mentioned before, skyrockets to being extremely egotistical around others, likely just hormonal teenager shit) and low confidence. I'm the most pessimistic guy anyone could ever meet and nobody can stand to have serious conversations with me because I'm so negative. I'm selfish, I'm hypocritical, I'm insensitive. I speak before I think, and it causes me loads of problems sometimes. I even think I'm an aspie, just to put salt in the wound.I dwell on the past. Every mistake I've made, every little superficial thing I've done wrong, I'll dwell on. It'll take me far longer than it should to accept nobody is perfect and that everybody does stupid things from time to time. For the few significant things I did, I never forgave myself for. It's been months, and I don't see it changing. I'm self critical and criticize others yet I'm sensitive when anyone says anything to me. I can't handle criticism, I take it as an insult. My mood changes so easily, yet I'm also extremely apathetic at the same time. My emotions have control over me. I don't make sense, I'm such a hypocrite. I fear my secrets will get out and I'll be totally ruined and lose everyone I still hang on to now. Does anyone even really like me, or are they just using me when they have nobody else to talk to? I doubt everything and everything so much, I even lost my religion as a result. How could some all seeing, all loving, all knowing God allow these miserable things to happen in the world?I even almost lose my job often because I'm so lazy and absent minded and I forget things or just don't want to do them or whatever else. He's picked up on it, and if he wasn't as lenient as he is I'd be long gone.

307,"First off, just wanna warn you this post is long af so bear with me. Any straight up advice would be appreciated.Just for a little background, I am 19(m) and have recently dropped out of university after only 2 months because I realised I made a rushed decision in picking it. Since then I have almost demonised the thought of going to university even if it were for another course. Of course this has left me with a year out which in many ways can be refreshing and useful in picking up on experiences for work and sociability. Yet at the moment I am constantly paralysed by thoughts that even getting out of bed is a challenge. I am awaiting checks for any conditions relating to anxiety and depression.I have been going through depersonalisation which is very scary to me. The feeling of waking up not knowing the world as it is, feeling like a spectator to your physical self. I have been able to find a hunger for success in my life but at the moment this is blotted out by the sense that nothing feels real and lacking connection to the outside world. My social anxiety has become very intense recently but Ive always had a desire to be sociable and open to others because Ive always wanted to have plenty of friends. I have been able to control it for months at a time but it doesnt help now that its become worse again. Distancing behaviour is also present which worries me because I have close friendships which are hard to take interest in when you feel empty as fuck. One of my best friends is at a local uni but I see him from time to time as he lives a minute away from me - even this feels isolating because Im too overwhelmed by my thoughts. Feels like Im sinking in wet sand while Im watching everyone walk on. Really kills me.Strangely I have lost all interest in activities which is quite offputting when it comes into mind, but that doesnt stop me from doing them. I have started to gym 2-3 times a week and do badminton every Monday night - even then I feel like Im sleepwalking through everything and nothing is actually happening. Playing pool calms me down too, Id love to take on a sport competitively to keep me occupied.Admittedly I spend too much time on technology. For years I have spent my free time alternating between education and just gaming and mindlessly scrolling through the internet - something which I feel is a stigma for why I feel so empty especially at this point in life. I have not had any family issues in life (unless sibling rivalry at a young age counts).I have never experiences relationships, although I have been involved in situations with girls a few times. At the moment I would still be able to show interest in girls but never really feel a sort of connection beyond that as with anyone really. I feel like my mental problems have blocked off the idea of pleasure including relationships as Im too overwhelmed with my thoughts of finding a purpose.Socially I have been quite disconnected and very weirdly it feels like its ireelevant to me. This I would put down to depression because there have been plenty of times where Ive felt an urge to socialise and I had no problem meeting new people at college. I go out clubbing from time to time but i always end up zoning out into my own world of pain, I can never connect myself to the present. Despite this people say Im mature and can speak very fluently despite not feeling like this is the case. Also, simple concepts such as friendship feel non existent to me - one of the consequences of the forgetfulness I live through. Best way to describe my anxiety is its almost like Ive been reborn in every way and have no idea how to live. And that really scares me.As of now, the best way to describe myself is I feel alienated and lost. The world appears a completely foreign place to me and I fear a lot about the future (Ive come to an assumption this is one of the other reasons for me feeling depressed). I have low self-esteem and have been beating myself down about everything recently. I find it hard to process information which is tiring, but against all odds I did manage to pass my driving test in August first time. A lot of days I feel very lonely yet I cant help but isolate. As hard as it is to see the way forward amongst the fogginess that is my brain atm I have always maintained a strong interest in creative media and would like to start seeing sense in life in the present so I can live with clarity and happiness again rather than dreading on autopilot mode. I am living at home with my parents and my sister, depression makes me overlook the appreciation I should feel having a roof above my head - yet i still beat myself up because I feel like I should be experiencing life like a uni student should be at this age. Maybe its just a matter of loneliness rather than having to party every weekend at 19, its such a small thing when you think about it yet I feel suicidal when I realise Im spending more time dwelling on the lives of others my age than trying to sort mine out... pls tell me thats absolute irrational.Recently I have been lapsing in and out of intense anxiety and this relates to worries of not being able to create a good future and ending up underachieving. Basically one thought resulting in another thought - times this by 500 or 600. I want to seek help but everything has become so distorted that I sometimes question whether my life is worth living - does this mean decluttering before pursuing my career?I feel bad about myself and the fact that I dont have a thicker skin but when youre in such a state its so difficult to think logically even if starting off. I never want to disappoint my parents but hope is so thin when you go each day with a constant internal pain that not even close ones can understand. I just feel like a living zombie and my thoughts always tell me Ill never be able to climb out of the hole. (in short, depersonalisation, anxiety, possibly depression, hopelessness, lack of motivation is drowning out my desire to go and achieve and Im not sure how to cope). As of now I go one day feeling ok and actually find motivation to do small tasks, the next I could feel suicidal and end up sitting in all day isolating myself - I really hate this and doesnt define me at all. What makes me think Im going insane is when someone speaks to me - my disassociative state becomes emphasised and once again this creates a new spiral of thoughts. My friend told me Im just overthinking which makes sense in some ways but I still feel suicidal some days.I hope to go travelling around Europe and apply for an apprenticeship next year (maybe with the BBC), I would love to start a YouTube channel as this involves techniques I learnt at college, also I would love to continue on with media whether its television production or editing. But for now my goal is to rediscover my well-being and see life in a positive perspective so I can wake up one day actually knowing who I am physically, spiritually, and identity wise.  Im here on this earth in my own body. Small steps, but each one to better myself in some way. I want to break away from the spiral of living in fear and worry over every small action I make. At the moment I am in fear of the world and myself for reasons which I can not pinpoint but I want to reach a stage where I can lift myself out of the hole and keep rising. Sorry for the long ass post, Id be surprised if youve made it this far ;) Even as Im typing this now my mental state cant even acknowledge what reddit is. So bad I know. Like Im trapped in a hench-ass bubble around my mind. If you have any advice or questions please let it outIf you need anyone to speak to about interests or whatever your mind can think of, dont be afraid to drop me a message... stay positive :)(In short: Im going through anxiety and depression which has got me in a state of irrational overthinking and feeling constant fear. I still feel a drive to succeed in life but also being dragged into a spiral of depression no matter how hard I try. DP/DR making me feel super paranoid about everything. Always have a desire to get back on track but am in a state of total confusion and worry...)",1,0,24.20000076,0.081685707,0.45227468,0.189281508,0.210982829,0.065775298

310,"This may a really long ramble. I apologize.I know I'll get comments saying ""I care! Talk to me!"" But that's not what I mean. My whole family knows about my depression. I've told my mom and one of my sisters that I think about killing myself all the time. None of them ever mention it. I never get a ""hey, are you ok? want to talk?"" from either of them. They simply don't give a shit. My mom used to, but she rarely talks to me anymore. I'm 28 with three younger siblings, and I guess she stays too busy with them to worry about what the fuck I'm going through. We set up a time to go to lunch together once a week, which lasted a few months, but now she cancels more often than not (right now we're at 3 weeks in a row) because she's got other stuff to do. My dad has never asked me how I'm doing. The only time we've ever talked about it was years ago when I posted a facebook status about being depressed. In that post, I used profanity. He replied to me telling me that using that kind of language offends my younger siblings. That's the only thing he's ever said to me about it.I make it a point not to bother my family with my problems, to the point sometimes of not even coming around for weeks at a time.I don't have any friends. My best (and really only) friend through high school and college got married and moved an hour away, and now we rarely speak. I've tried, but people just don't seem to take an interest in me. I lent one of my ""friends"" in college $500 to pay his bills. He was grateful and paid it back, but that was it. Rarely spoke to me before or since then. Basically just used me as a loan officer.I'm now to the point where the selfishness and underhandedness of people has made me hate the whole human race.I've never been on a date. Every girl/woman that I've asked has given the ""I've got something else to do this weekend"" excuse. That happened all through high school and college to the point where I just gave up. I haven't even tried to get anyone in 6-7 years. By the way, none of them give a shit either.I hate my job. I'm a software developer and I feel like I'm drowning every single day. I read an article every day about the next new technology/programming language/framework/etc. and it just mentally drains me. People around me have a passion for it, and I'm just trying to get through my work without crying. I feel like a total failure at my job, and even if I didn't, I don't have the passion or the desire to learn anything new or to excel at it. The problem is there isn't anything else that I want to do. I have no hobbies, passions, nothing. When I leave work, I go home and watch TV. On weekends, I sit on the couch and watch TV. That is literally my life. Guess what? No one gives a fuck about that either. I've had therapists (and my mom) ask me ""What do you want to do?"" and ""Start looking for another job"". I want to shout at them ""WHAT JOB? I DON'T WANT ANYTHING ELSE BUT FOR MY LIFE TO END!"" None of them get it. It's almost like it's a given for them that I should, by default, have an interest or desire in something and that's what I should pursue. They either don't understand or don't care enough to give me a useful answer.I don't know what else to say. I'm pretty sure my life is going to end soon. Like, within the next 6 months.

But now that Im in college, its really starting to hit me. I need somebody to hold me when Im shaking, or to talk to me when Im crying, but I have done nothing to deserve it, and am all too aware of it.

I was off meds for 3-4 months and still the symptoms didn't go.And i switched to a doctor that i really like, he prescribed me fluoxetine and rhisperidone ,i took them for 1 month BUT after a while i noticed that i started to develop severe memory problems to the point where i can't remember what i studied yesterday,even though i studied hard.Anyhow i had to stop the fluoxetine because i am allergic to it.And i have a new prescription on the way.My question is,does anyone know what is happening??I want to start a new masters program and i think i am doomed to fail.

324,"Hi everybody, Ive a question for those who may have experience with various anti-depressants and/or supplements, which is probably 99% of readers here. In the next paragraph Ill briefly describe what I take and how meds make me feel for background info. If you want to skip straight to the question, go to the third paragraph. Ive been taking Bupropion xl 300mg, and Viibryd 20mg. Never had issues with Bupropion except that the very pronounced positive effects it has stopped after about a week after beginning to game it. In my case I had take it in the past but for less than a year. This happened each time after start of the prescription.  Viibryd doesnt have stimulating effects I could feel but it definitely does not have the sedating effects of SSRIs. I am talking about how when they begin working they do take away intense worrying and depression but also , at least in my case, they reduce motivation to do random things that may be called fun optional activities like going outside or playing video games. That in addition to increased sweating is why I choose to not take standard SSRIs and instead asked something without demotivating effects. Viibryd really does seem to not have any side effects, but its intended effect is weak so far as well. The question is about a problem Ive felt for a week now. I didnt stop or reduce meds I am taking, but my mind feels as if the motivation to do things I cognitively understand I should be interested in is very weak or gone, and it causes me to have a sensation that some areas of my brain may be working at less than 50% capacity. I cannot say I feel dumb as I am able to do all the Norma mental tasks, but the ability to focus on them and actively think and analyze goes away when random or tangential thoughts take over. I can even get some more concrete idea that the mind is not at full speed when I play some competitive board games either against the computer or against people online. I can see evaluations of each move and game outcomes. Theyre displayed on a graph where I can see 2-3 years back of daily play, for example. Any idea what could be causing it, or how to shake it off?

341,"I'm 19 and last year I had to drop out of college due to problems with my depression and anxiety, I then moved back in with my mom for a couple months, as my mental health seemed to get worse and worse my mom would kind of threaten me with sending me to a hospital for my anxiety and depression. It was then the last thing I wanted to do. Things kept getting worse however, I started to have panic attacks daily where I would shake uncontrollably and barely be able to breath, anyone else experience that? It's so strange to me that I can like have a seizure over just about anything, my mom would basically yell at me to stop and say stuff like ""you're ok, don't be anxious"" or ""it's ok anxiety isn't a part of you, you can break it"" and stuff along those lines. I started to get these really severe testicular pains that resulted in 4 ER visits. I thought I was dying or something, but all the tests for everything came back negative. Looking for answers I went to my regular doctor who had known me all my life and within minutes she told me the pain was most likely from my anxiety and that I needed to go seek treatment ASAP. I started balling, my mom and gf took me straight to a treatment center and idk how but I felt better after just signing up for a IOP program, it was like admitting I had a anxiety and depression disorder helped me deal with it in a way, my pain stopped. While on the waiting list for the program I moved in with my gf and away from my mom, which I now realize is one of the best decisions I've ever made, I never knew how much my mom was stressing me out on a daily basis till I moved out, I know her intentions were good but the way she went about trying to help only made me feel worse. My gf is so much more supportive and helpful when it comes to my depression than I ever thought anyone could be. After I finally got to go to the IOP program thing I learned so much about what I was going through my whole life and when I was done I finally felt some relief that I had been waiting for. I felt like I was on top of the world, I felt cured in a way, I would occasionally feel depressed or anxious but the coping mechanisms I learned in my group therapy made it all manageable, I applied for college again for something different than I was originally going for, and to a different college that was closer to my new home. I started seeing a therapist and psychologist. I realized what my mom would say to me was the last thing you should say to someone suffering from mental health episodes, I owned my anxiety and depression and made them my bitch. I felt great but then of course everything soon would go to complete shit.I got in a huge fight with my mom and out of the blue my depression and anxiety came back in full storm, I was getting yelled at by mom over the phone and I just started shaking like crazy, my face was twitching, which never happened before when I would get panic attacks and threw up and I think I said something like ""I can't talk right now I have to go"" and hung up, which lead to my mom calling me upwards of 20 times and texting me an unbelievable amount of messages mainly about how disrespectful and ungrateful I was, my gf came home to my just twitching and balling my eyes out on the floor. She managed to calm me down after about an hour and I explained to her what happened and I would get into what the fight was about because I think this post is gonna be long enough but after explaining it to my gf she agreed that my mom was being completely ridiculous over what she was first upset about. But after that I feel like my mental health was 100x worse than it was before the IOP program, my panic attacks came back worse and more frequently than ever before, I still can't even get out of bed until 4 or 5pm, and the fight was 4 months ago, since then I decided I wanted to see a new therapist but haven't gotten myself to call to schedule a new appointment with someone else after canceling with who I saw before, I've been switched on meds so many times I don't remember and all the meds do is seem to make things worse, and I'm going to full on postal if I hear that same damn speech about how it takes time to work and the pills are basically guess and check until they find one that works. I'm frustrated with how little I do all day, I don't have a job and I couldn't get myself to actually go to school for the registration so I guess I dropped out once again. The thought of school just makes me anxious as hell, I've got a friend going into the trades and I've decided that that's what I do with my life but I haven't been able to take any actual steps towards doing it, I do nothing all day but wallow in my own sadness and cry, I constantly have panic attacks that cause me to go lie down for hours my gf complains that she's bored all the time and that she wants to do stuff but I'm so scared to leave the house, I do for her but it's so hard for me, she doesn't seem to understand I gave up trying to explain it. I try the coping strategies that helped me so much before but nothing worked, nothing helps anymore. I feel so foolish, I feel so helpless, I feel so lost in life. I've been lurking on here for a while reading other people's stories I thought I might share my own I guess. I'd be curious to know if anyone else is going through anything similar, things just keep getting worse and worse.

347,"Hey everyone!Gender: female (me), male (him). Both 24, been together for a year. I recently found out about a month ago that my boyfriend of one year had cheated on me. I'll keep the story short but we always struggled about his flirtatious behavior towards other women and how it bothered me. He always promised it would never go too far. In the end of July, he called me upset from another country (we work for an airline) saying that he met a girl at the bar and was walking her home trying to be a gentleman and that she kissed him at the door. He says he was so shocked he didn't know how to respond and he froze but that he feels horrible and he's never going to communicate with her again. After he came home, things became very complicated. I learned that I was pregnant, and had an abortion. Right after the abortion, he wasn't very supportive and said he wanted to take a break, but not see other people. I told him if that's what he needed to go do it, but no seeing other people. I found out later on that he met up with that girl again, went to her house, she made him dinner, and they kissed and laid together in her bed. She told me that he made it very clear to her that he didn't have a girlfriend and couldn't because of his job. I also found out from another girl he was talking to that he approached her at a bar, told her she was so beautiful he had to speak to her, exchanged info, and invited her to visit him in NYC. He also had photos of these women and a few others I do not know saved on his phone. My heart is broken. The next day, he came begging for a second chance and promised to change everything. He has since reset his phone and cut off contact with them. I know he is trying and I am trying to forgive as well I am just struggling so hard. I still feel so hurt and betrayed. I keep lashing out in anger at him, I get aggressive and I fight and scream, which is not my character at all.

353,"First I just want you to know that this is probably gonna be, as stated in the title, a quite messy wall of text... There are just a lot of things I wanna vent and some of them don't quite connect with each other, but I'll do my best.Hello. I'm a 24 years old Brazilian male. Currently unemployed and recently found out that I have Misophonia, a mental condition that renders me completely unable to listen to dogs barking without having an instant, involuntary anger attack. Personality wise I think of myself as someone wise and mature, and Im not afraid to admit that because honestly, I worked hard to acquire this knowledge. I'm also quite nice and try to help people out as much as I can. I always try to smile to people when I'm out, because I've learned that a smile can sometimes brighten someone's day a little (or a lot!), and you can even end up getting another friend in the end. However... Recently I realized that growing up to be so nice and wise wasnt as good as I expected itEven at my teen ages, when I was still quite nave, I already had an understanding of what I wanted from people and what I wouldnt tolerate from them. So Becoming wiser than people at my age came out pretty naturally to me. But sometimes I just wish it never did... For one I became able to read people like books. All I need is a quick glance at someone or a brief chat to tell if were gonna be good friends, casual friends or if I rather not bond with them. Sure, you shouldnt judge people by their appearances, and I always try not to. But once you keep seeing always the same patterns The look on their faces, the way they talk, the way they dress, what they like It just becomes really easy to connect the dots and tell that someone wont click with you. And that lead me to become rather lonely myself I do talk to my family every day, and I am in fact nice to anyone who isnt an asshole to me, but I just developed way too many standards over time and those make me unable to find myself comfortable bonding with people that just dwell in their own mediocrity and refuse to change. People who dont appreciate the beauty of small things, who are unable to recognize and value small acts that truly make a friendship shine So in the end its pretty much my own fault for being lonely, and thats fine for most of the time really. Ive done a quite good job at dealing with it over the time. But sometimes it just gets dark, and no one is here for me when Im always there for themThe thing about getting stronger and stronger is that Eventually you become so strong that you dont have anyone equally or stronger than you to comfort you. And that REALLY sucks. You become able of carrying so many people on your shoulders, but you never have anyone to carry you when you need it, even if just for a little bit Getting comfort from people that dont quite understand your position just gets predictable and ineffective with time. Sometimes you just need someone that really gets you and knows the right words to ease your heart, but Im slowly accepting the fact that Ill just be alone forever. Even though I have the lowest of expectations when meeting new people, they always fail me. I try my best to accept peoples defects and value their virtues, but they dont do the same for me Theyre unable to sit down and talk things over when Im the one who messes up. So they just drop everything and leave me.To be fair I think my biggest nemesis right now is my misophonia These angry spasms dont happen a lot through the day, but they do happen every day in fact And when they happen it feels like a spike stabbing my mind and giving me this stupid involuntary reaction. I dont usually blow up in front of people, but I get really uncomfortable and have to retreat to my sanctuary. If I could get a job things would be so much easier Im pretty sure it would even help my misophonia out. But were currently going through an economic crisis and getting a job has been nearly impossible for me, since the companies have to pay your transport to work but theyve been refusing to do so, and employing only people that live close to them. And unfortunately I live far from the region which usually employs, so theres thatI just really miss being able to lie down on my bed and shut down. And wake up the next day and run to work. A lot of the times before trying to sleep my mind just wanders to dark places, and makes it hard to fall asleep On top of that, some days Im abruptly awakened by the neighbors dog, which is just Hellish. Its so bad. I really want my life to get back on track I miss having money to buy stuff. Going out and buying me a yummy treat. Having the energy to focus on something productiveIm sure this will eventually end. It will become just another experience and Ill get even stronger (oh no). But right now This burden is just really weighing me down. I just wanna have peace again and work on my dreams, but all these situations render me unable to do anything but wait And the uncertainty of it is really maddening I know that there are people in situations much, MUCH darker than mine. And while thats somewhat comforting, that doesnt change the fact that this is really wearing me down And having no one to lean over just feels sad and hopeless. But I dont wanna give up. I feel I have a genuinely good heart and I wanna help people find that goodness within them as well. And I dont wanna just throw away all the progress Ive made until here.Thank you SO much if youve read his far. I really needed to get this out of my chest, and I just hope to read some uplifting words. And be reminded Im not alone in this.

354,"First of all, I apologise for posting this in here if it's not appropriate - just let me know if that's the case - but I really couldn't think of anywhere else to post it & I suffer from depression so - here goes...I'm going to see a panto tomorrow with my Mum, and I have reason to believe that my estranged step-daughter is involved in it, and I'm terrified of her. She hates my very guts and has been nothing but abusive towards me. She basically turned my lovely, late husband (her father) into a victim of domestic abuse by beating him up twice - the first time he was left with a permanent scar on his cheek, the second she knocked one of his teeth out. She has been diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder. I haven't seen her for 4 years since she turned on me for refusing to give her any money (well, I tried to send her a couple of cheques but it wasn't good enough so she sent them back in a rage & said she never wanted to see me again.)Actually, she never visited me after my husband's death - she arranged at least half a dozen visits but cancelled each one by text message at the last minute... She sent her brother round to ask for money - he was in my house for 3 hours & wouldn't leave. He said it was lucky I was dealing with him & not his sister or it would have been the worse for me. Eventually I got him to go, but I was very shaken.I have Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, CFS and an ileostomy - I couldn't fight her if she went for me - I know she is capable of that. I have also been diagnosed with PTSD since my husband's sudden death & I know her behaviour has been part of that. I even dream about her on a regular basis. I've really only just started to leave the house again properly in 4 years. But I also feel guilty - maybe I should have given her more money. She was my husband's daughter after all and he did love her dearly, I know that. Maybe I should have tried to help her. I was a pretty useless step-mother, I'm sure (she does have a real Mum, who she has also beaten up on a fairly regular basis - she may not be doing that these days - at least, I hope not!) I'm sure none of this is what my husband would have wanted. I should add that she & her brother are both beneficiaries in my Will - it seems only fair - but I haven't told them.I was unable to have children of my own after suffering Primary Ovarian Failure at the age of 17 and failed to go through puberty properly. Tests were run but they couldn't even find my ovaries - it's possible that I never had them in the first place but we don't know. I really feel like I've been left with nothing at times - I know I should count my blessings though.Apologies if this is confused! There is a lot more detail I could go into but I'd better not. I'm just hoping she doesn't spot me at this panto tomorrow because I'm terrified something awful will happen if she does. Hopefully she'll just ignore me. God, I feel so pathetic and useless, and so, so lonely - I've tried hard to get out & about again & I'm sick of feeling so scared all the time. On a more general level, I feel like I must be a really bad person.Thanks for reading!",1,-0.100000001,11.89999962,0.048488282,0.428183347,0.414420933,0.103221029,0.005686418

357,"First of all, I know it's not safe at all to auto-diagnose on this kind of issues, but that's why I'm here searching for advice.Anyway, during this year I've been showing an increasing lack of motivation and happiness. It started around the April I think.I've always been really motivated and generally happy person with a lot of projects and hobbies (music, programming, videogames, 3D modelling, etc) that I really loved. But this year has been... different. Starting a lot of projects left unfinished, feeling tired and empty a lot of the time, dropped out of the sport I was practicing because I just couldn't go out there and put energy into something, although always suffering from introversion, it was totally worse than before. I never considered suicide a solution to anything though, I strongly believe that I could never do that or even harm myself for dealing with this.Finishing the secondary school two weeks ago didn't help because I already lost almost all connection to my school friends (almost all my friends are school friends, except a few). And a week from now it's my graduation night (kinda like prom but not quite) and I'm already feeling really anxious and the feeling of not wanting to go is growing stronger and stronger, but I'm going anyway because I already payed lots for the invitations and clothes.Also, distance is growing between me and my crush, to which I was really close before, and it just makes me sad.Nowadays, my routine is basically wake up at 1 PM, eating, playing videogames, do some chores, if I'm feeling inspired I might play piano for a while but not too much, and go to sleep.I feel like I don't have anyone to talk to, even though I know I have my family and friends who would be happy to help, but I just can't get enough courage to talk to anyone. I also considered searching professional help, but knowing myself I either wouldn't be able to ask my dads to help me search or I would end up not going because of anxiety.I also am going to start university next year and I feel I don't have the emotional state to start studying and putting myself out there in the world.

I usually keep it in check fairly well, but now he things going on around me are making it so hard to do that, there's so many things I've done wrong and mistakes I've made that it's probably done irreparable damage to my marriage and my kids don't even look at me the same.This last month has been particularly hard. My family and I are about to lose our place to live because our previous property manager has issued a non-renewal letter to the new management company before leaving her position for a promotion with this new company. We're currently on a month to month lease and they just bumped my rent up by nearly $500 dollars compared to what we're used to paying. All the while this is going on, my wife is working full time, and I'm working two days a week because we can't afford a baby sitter for our children so while I'm alone most of the time with my kids, I can't seem to enjoy the time I spend with them at all. She makes more money than I do, so it makes sense for her to work full time and me part time. It was a crappy situation that made me regret a lot of choices we made but it was livable because we were able to keep a roof over our heads, and now we're probably going to be out on the street in less than two weeks.I have the money for the rent now, but I'm stuck in my head trying to decide if I should pay it, or try and find another place to live. If I do pay it then we won't have enough to cover our utilities and our lights will be cut off.

At that time I already often was feeling down, so I texted her about it (probably wasnt a smart idea). So yeah, she went to the teacher and after two worthless sessions with a completly inept teacher and a cold principal they called my parents. Now my parents were very nice and their only statement was, that I should stop cutting myself because the scars wouldnt look nice. So life continued and so did my depression. Later i started texting another girl and found out that she also was depressed. So we had some good chats, but it was kind of useless. So I called for help a third time. Nothing. A fourth time. Nothing. One more time. And this last time fucked me over so hard. Basically the last time I texted somebody and she didnt take it that well. She started treating me like shit and was constantly harassing and insulting me infront of everybody.  But that wasnt enough. She had to tell all my classmates and with her version of the story everbody now thinks Im a psycho. This isnt the only problem but, here is the story that lead me to the brink.TL;DR the whole school thinks Im a psycho and an asshole.

376,"I couldnt see at the time that I was afraid of letting people in. I thought it would be better and stronger if I did this by myself, if I held back and didnt expose you to what was happening in my mind so I wouldnt be childish or immature. I was in a bad state, seeing things in a very distorted way, and avoiding people out of fear they would admonish my thoughts. I isolated which has hurt me so bad: the time feels wasted, I can never get it back.All Ive really wanted in life is to love and be loved. Other people see me differently than how I see myself. Because i felt I was not adequate, i overcompensated. It was embarrassing, confusing and painful.Over the last several weeks, Ive dropped the act a bit. Ive been able to look at people in the eye and smiles come naturally. I see people differently, as wanting to help rather than hurt. I see myself as imperfect but the same as others - lovingly imperfect. Allowing and accepting these qualities makes me more able to do so in others.I remember the talks we had, the moments of sharing our must vulnerable selves, and feeling the utmost relief from being heard, validated and love. It is the only way. I see know that I have more knowledge to make better choices about how to spread love. Only through love, and soft understanding, does the message get across. Only through love will their be another chance at forgiveness and a better life.I hope that my friend understand. I think they will. I hope  that I can continue to try to ward off those critical thoughts toward myself and my parents, and accept them in a way I could not before. That is perhaps my biggest fault and evil, blaming and criticizing them in my head for what felt like being wronged and ignored.I wish I could tell them all of this. They may not really know the extent of the problem, nor understand.Above all, I thank a therapist who listened to me vent and complain, and saw me only through loving eyes. I thank her for pointing out the good in me and for listening in a non judgmental way and for treating me with respect when I could not give it to myself. Our latest session was so healing, I cant explain why or how, but without it I wouldnt feel at this very moment.Thank you for helping me turn to the light side, to lift the veil of fear that has clouded my ability to see what is true and right, to see that there is a better way. Thank you for showing me that without rain, only a Desert can exist. Maybe this rain helps me become a person who has a forest of feeling to share with others in an imperfect hut lovable way. I find it hard to feel harsh toward others when I know many others can be as lost, hurt and confused.God, please grant me the ability to see the light when my mind wants to jump to the worst possible conclusions about myself. Please help me see that Im loved in spite of my faults, and that what I think and what is actually happening can be very different. I hope that I can return to the light over and over again, to the best of my ability, without becoming hurt and in pain as I have been.Thank you. Edit: I also wanted to add that I am grateful for choosing to quit marijuana two weeks ago. It was perhaps a major contributor to the depression, and I see that I wasnt being loyal or true to myself. It affects everyone differently, but it may help or hurt those who are sensitive or have a chemical imbalance. Anyone struggling with drug addiction, know that you have valid reasons to do so. I certainly did, but quitting has cleared my mind to remember that life has good moments, pure moments of love.",1,0.100000001,15.80000019,0.048909545,0.639511943,0.210795671,0.079894237,0.020888582

393,"I had a major research paper due yesterday that was worth a third of my grade, and there was just no way I could finish it on time.  What I submitted wasn't a reflection of how much research I had done because I didn't have time to cite it all or arrange it into a logically flowing essay.  I couldn't have written anything coherent without first doing heaps of research because none of it was common sense.  I had an A in that course and I'm probably going to finish with a C.  I worked so hard all semester.  The time constraints for the larger assignments in that course were insane.  I spent so much miserable, sleep-deprived time on that course and this final blow is what it amounted to.I'm not privileged enough to not have a job.  My mom is too poor to help me pay for college.  Maybe taking other classes at the same time was a mistake, but I'm not psychic.  I don't understand why the due date couldn't have been next week, when classes actually end.  I feel guilty for resting over Thanksgiving break when I apparently should have kept my nose to the grindstone.  I shouldn't have cooked anything, I should have begged my mom to not invite my obnoxious uncle over, I should have spent every day that the library was open in the library- there was no real break, but I was too naive and burnt out from previous weeks to see that.  I actually did study over the break- just lightly, because I thought that was okay.I feel stupid and irresponsible.  I feel like I'm getting what I deserve.  People will always judge me as adjectives rather than circumstances.  I actually found the course extremely interesting, but I just couldn't keep up in the end.  Experiences like this lower my sense of self-efficacy.  They show me that success in life is largely out of my control.  The subject was central to my identity- it was about globalization and policy.  A C is what I'll have to show for it.  I could have written a stellar paper if I had just one more week, and I think we all deserve one more week because that's when most other finals happen and this assignment was a massive 12-15 page research paper on what we'd recommend to solve very large scale problems with no clear solutions. I wasted hours and hours researching how to reform American K-12 schools only to find that the poverty in some schools was driving down the average test scores of all of them.  The answer I found was preschool- nobody talks about that.  It isn't in the news.  All the talk is about funding and understaffing.  Apparently, the economic inequality in the US is so severe that it screws up poor kids for life, and excellent preschools give them the early stimulation that their parents can't give them.  How they perform in kindergarten compared to their wealthier peers actually predicts how likely they are to not graduate from high school, but nobody talks about that. It makes sense now, but it took me so long just to arrive at that solution.  I only had two weeks, counting Thanksgiving break, plus other classes, plus work, plus my crazy uncle, plus my car breaking down an hour away, and plus having to wake up too early to drive my mom to work because we're all sharing one car now.

Didn't understand road signs or how to merge etc, just tried really hard not to puke. No one took the time to teach me, either. Yes, I've tried Dramamine. It's not even just the car that makes me sick, it's the flashing sunlight through the trees. Like a strobe light. Watching tv at night, and certain games do the same thing.The summer before last, I tried pot. Noticed it took the nausea away and I enjoyed car rides quite a bit. I could actually look and see what's going on around me. Got a bottle of CBD oil a few months ago so I wouldn't have to smoke every time I get in the car, works great. Felt inspired to finally learn how to drive. Failed my learners test twice in a row and got discouraged. I want to give it another go, right now, but it's so hard.

We have three children. He has PTSD and is rated 100% disabled by the VA. He gets benefits that put a roof over our heads and pay our major bills. He does not work, because it puts too much pressure on him and it worsens his condition. Which means I have to work, and I'm happy to, but I can't drive. He does not have the patience to teach me. I completely rely on him for everything. I've lost several jobs for lateness, because he is very slow in the morning. I want to say it's not his fault, but he stays up until 2am playing video games and chatting up girls on okcupid. I started a new job recently and love it, but we got into a fight yesterday because we were running late (he wouldn't get out of bed) and he wanted me to eat before going into work. I told him there was no time and I don't want to get fired, but he pulled into a McDonald's drive thru anyway. I had time to eat half a hash brown before he parked in front of my work and he got angry when I gave the rest of the food to him. He doesn't understand how to prioritize some things. I ended up getting a warning from my boss. I have no friends, because he always ends up trying to fuck them (he is a serial cheater). He's even invited two of his female friends to live with us, both without asking me how I felt about it. He doesnt want to go on dates with me, even if it's free. Our sex life is a joke. His idea of foreplay is wiggling his cock in my face or saying, ""Gimme some."" He doesn't give me orgasms and doesn't understand why I'm no longer enthusiastic about getting on my knees for him. He will get angry with me and treat me like shit if I deny him. After I do what he wants, he goes back to his games and talking to girls. He falls asleep on the couch most nights, just passes out wherever he is.I don't talk to anyone or go anywhere. I have zero friends, really. I don't even make eye contact with other men my age. I've fantasized about having a license, leaving him, getting my own place and entering the dating scene. I'm often told by people that I'm pretty, but they don't know how hideous my stretch marks are from having three c-sections. If I were to meet a man, I wouldn't be able to undress in front of him. Yeah yeah guys don't care about stretch marks, sure. But I will still feel inferior to other women, it will feel like I'm a downgrade and I would feel sorry for whoever gets stuck with me. I'm alone but I want to escape. My husband's family has money, if I were to leave, he'd win custody of our children because I wouldn't have a stable place for them to live. I try to look past his faults because I know how worthless I am, and I have faults of my own, but it's getting harder. I just really want to die, I've tried getting help and they put me in the hospital for two days, twisted around everything I said and acted like I was an actual threat to myself, and sent me home with a prescription. My husband got tired of taking me to therapy after the second session.I'm really tired, I love my children but I can't even drive them to a fucking doctors appointment. I love my job, but whenever my coworkers ask me questions about myself or want to chit chat, I have nothing to say. I don't know why I'm even posting here, I doubt I'll follow through with any advice. I don't know what else to say, so I'll just submit this post. Sorry for the jumbled mess, thanks in advance to whoever reads this. Please don't link me to a suicide hotline. I'm not going to kill myself.

I used to know what my emotions were, what I enjoyed, what I disliked, all of that. Lately it's just been a blur to me. I suppose if it's worth mentioning, I had depression for about a year and a half.. or so, I finally ""fixed"" myself at the beginning of this year by force, although I'm not sure if it worked out for the best. I've gone through a lot, at least I tell myself I have in my mind, and now I feel as if I'm fading. Not going back into depression necessarily, not anything like that, I mean fading as a person. I'm losing my humanity and my will do to... anything. I guess it's kind of what you hear a lot, everything I enjoy is becoming dull to me now, and this has happened before, although it's been lasting a lot longer this time. Video games are still slightly appealing, although I feel like I don't have enough time to do everything I want with them. Music is nice, I love music and all, but that's beginning to fade. All I listen to now anyways is the kind of music that makes you feel nostalgic / melancholy, so I dunno. It helps clear my mind, not worsen my mood.

423,"i was born a son to my dad, a local politician, and my mom, currently working in a company's administration department. i had a really odd childhood. i remember being very quiet and calm, but also very angry. my mom used to spoil me a lot, she bought me everything i wanted and always let me win in games we played together. i didn't know what frustration was for the longest time, and was really used to always get what i wanted, and when that wasn't the case i'd get really angry, and i mean really angry, not just a normal child tantrum. i probably learned this from my mom, who gets angry and shouts at everything, even the most insignificant of things, she's been this way since i can remember. my classmates back in kindergarten used to make fun of me and i would get so angry and that would amuse them so they'd bully me more, then i'd go to the teacher so he/she would scold them for bullying me which made them hate me and bully me even more. i hated it. i was extremely serious-minded, and even the slightest joke against me made me scream with anger. my only friend was this kid (who is still my friend today) who at one point started bullying me too in order to get along with the other kids this made me slowly get away from all my classmates and i'd always be alone in break time. i hated breaks because i'd be so bored and it would be embarrassing to be alone, to be the kid with no friends. at age 3 i used a computer for the first time, and it became my world. i had no social life basically, and lived inside my virtual world, barely ever went out of the house. all of this lasted throughout all of primary and middle school. my dad was never really present, as he was with my mom but didn't live with us because of his job, and left my mom when i was 12, after which i never saw him very often again. my problems with anger persisted as the years passed by, and started hating going to school more and more each passing day. anxiety also started being a big problem for me, and still persists to this day. i've always felt like i was the weird kid and constantly desired to be like everyone else, to be accepted by others, to not be bullied and/or ignored by my peers.this is the small bit that i remember from my childhood, because i've forgotten most of it. i really believe that it was really traumatizing. i am 18 now and i've figured out that all these things are what made me develop into a lazy, depressed, angry, empty shell of a human being. later in life i'd find many, many friends who would later abandon me (or so i would think from their actions) which, combined with my dad's abandonment, made me develop a deep fear of being abandoned. the fact that i was so spoiled as a kid and so used to instant, effortless gratification, since i always had good grades and was constantly praised for it plus the internet which was my easy way to entertain myself without having to socialize, has made me unable to make an effort for anything. also my lack of socializing made me into the most introverted kid ever, which is something i have just been able to get over slowly since i was 16 and started going to parties and whatnot. when i was 14, i came to the philosophical realization that life is meaningless and that nothing i do actually matters in any way, which also triggered more depressive symptoms in me as time passed.all of this has also caused me a lot of trouble with substance abuse. i discovered marijuana at 15 and since then became an addict, smoking every single day, even when it started being damaging to me and made me have serious problems with my parents (mostly my mom). i also started going to parties and getting fucked up on alcohol and smoking cigarettes pretty much every weekend. at 17 i got into psychedelics and had near death experiences with certain drugs like 25i-NBOMe due to my irresponsible use of these substances. i've thankfully stopped smoking weed, so far i've been clean for 7 days and going strong (hopefully).i am currently in psychiatric treatment, i take 150mg bupropion and 100mg lamotrigine every day, which was prescribed to me as a way to boost my mood, concentration, and energy, since one of the main symptoms of my depression was the fact that i felt completely demotivated and unwilling to do anything, plus excessively sleepy every single day regardless of how much i slept. i was also in therapy for two years until i decided to stop going to it since it was starting to becoming a nuisance and seemed more and more useless to me as time went by.i don't know what to do. i feel empty, anxious and depressed but most of all i feel completely traumatized. it's like all these uncomfortable and sad memories of my childhood still linger in my subconscious and hurt me, but at the same time i can't remember 99% of them, like they're a ghost that's haunting me constantly but at the same time it becomes invisible so i can't fight against it. i've felt this way since i was 12 (although back then i didn't really know why) and it started getting significantly worse around a year ago. i get angry at the smallest things just like my mom does. i want to feel better, i want to be a normal person. i feel like I have a mental handicap, an illness that i just can't fight against. the mental states i get into have started going out of my own control and make me do the stupidest shit. i've cried myself to sleep countless times by now and ripped entire shirts to shreds because of my anger bursts. help me, please, i'm starting to run out of options. it's only a matter of time

428,"I have just gotten out of the mental facility here in my city.  I live in Florida. It was a very interesting situation that I did my best to be positive about. Here's how it all started: I woke up feeling very depressed and anxious and told my boss I would not be able to come in. When she began arguing with me, I told her that I was sorry, but I did not want to come to work when I was experiencing bad thoughts (which I guess was a bad thing to say... it could be taken out of context but honestly I just confided in her because she told me I could trust her and she'd always be there to listen if I needed anything, and I just wanted some sympathy.) I told her I was going to go see my therapist and get some help and that is why I wanted a day off. She promptly fired me because she said I was absent too much (I had to take one day off because of a doctor's appointment and one day due to a medical emergency, but I tried to come to work during that day, and she decided to close the office early for the holidays.) I was very upset and begged for my job back, but she told me she was clear on her decision. I applied for some jobs from my laptop and decided to take a nap, only to wake up to three officers at my door. I was very confused and afraid. They informed me my boss had told them I told her I was experiencing suicidal thoughts and was worried I'd hurt myself. This was hard to swallow. I informed them I was fine, and that I did not mean to worry anyone, and I only turned to her because she expressed that she'd always be willing to listen if needed. I felt as though I could trust her, and I feel very stupid for doing so. I was calm when the police came into my home, but they told me they had to take me to the hospital. At this point, I was terrified. I was shaking as they told me to put on clothes and gather my things. Now, I've never been to a facility before, and they had me convinced that I was only going to get checked out for a couple hours. I was hoping that the intake staff there would dismiss me. I have struggled with depression and anxiety, but I have never felt suicidal and I've actually been on an amazing road to recovery since this summer, with no issues at all. So this really floored me. I was put in the facility for three days. I was so upset at first, but as I realized there was nothing I could do about it, I accepted my fate and stayed positive. I was polite to the staff and treated everyone respectfully, followed the rules and participated in some really neat group activities. It really wasn't a terrible experience. I actually really had a lot of fun considering. I was in an inpatient program that was much less intimidating than I expected. My meals were taken care of, as I do not eat meat, I got to take hot showers and I slept like a baby after taking a sleep aid I requested from the nurse. I did cool art therapy sessions and kept busy by reading books. I wasn't happy I was in there, but I was determined to make the best of it. I just want to write this to let everyone know to be careful. I told this boss out of confidentiality that I was struggling, and she betrayed me... I understand I can't just blab about mental illness to anyone, but I figured I'd be okay under the american disability act to receive reasonable accomodation, as I wanted to take that day off to go see my counselor, who I hadn't seen in weeks because of his holiday plans. It upset me that even though I was taking action for what they thought was a problem, I was still taken away.But there is nothing wrong with that. Everyone struggles. This was just another experience for me. But, it held me back so much, as I had finals this week and projects due this week... and my boss was well aware of that... she made things so much more difficult for me. Thankfully, I talked to my professors and they really have pulled together to be flexible and I am permitted to take my exams and turn in my projects next week. I have come a long way through my recovery from depression and anxiety, and while this was a huge setback, I will not let it break me. I was prescribed a small antianxiety pill that I will take as needed and will continue to see my therapist. I was thinking of pursuing the issue legally but not sure if I have time or funds... Just wanted to vent. Thank you.",1,0,19.79999924,0.061282884,0.599637151,0.229582429,0.094474778,0.015022804
429,"I have been depressed since I was ~9, severely depressed since I was 12, I'm 19 now. I genuinely can't remember a time I was happy in a lasting way. I was so severely depressed in high school I never made friends or developed interests. I would just go to school, come home, do my work, go to my job, and sleep. I didn't even play video games, listen to music, or watch TV. I did nothing. I don't have memories from high school. I've started telling people I meet (who I know I'll never meet again) that I was in a coma for a few years and it's basically fucking true.Every single person I know has something they're interested in. Something they're knowledgeable about, something they seek out on their own time. For me, if I have free time, I sleep or play with my rabbits. I also have almost no memory or attention span so even when I try to get into things, or talk about things i'm slightly interested in, like literature and music, I can't remember names or albums or genres and I just come off sounding like a poser. I don't get references to popular movies or TV shows, I didn't have a Smiths phase in high school, I genuinely feel like I can't relate to others.I feel like I'm at least 7 years younger than everyone around me. I didn't socialize at all in high school so I'm extremely awkward and uninteresting and I never know how to respond to what people say. I don't know how to seek out my interests because my college town is tiny and rainy so I never feel like going outside. Right now I'm in school for essentially human trafficking relief and most of my extracurricular life revolves around a project relating to child pornography so no one wants to talk or socialize and I for damn sure don't want to talk about that at parties. Other than that I have no skills, nothing to show for my nineteen pathetic years of existence.Has anyone overcome this?

Work, my mother who don't give me the space to live, and then there was an abusive boyfriend an a narcissistic friend.I got medication for my depression, the anxiety disorder, the character disorder, they also made the diagnosis of a cognitive disorder.The therapy helped me a lot, nearly a month ago I managed it to move into my own flat, and all was so... easy. So warm, bright. I could do whatever I want to, at work everything was fine....till yesterday.Suddenly I am missing that narcissistic friend, could not help my best friend with her problems, feeling ugly, that I never will live a normal life...The pressure to do self harm grows, I feel like I am useless... that I have no right to live, that there is no task for me.

469,"Formatting may be shit, this is my first real post on Reddit, and I'm not bothering to test the formatting rigorously before posting. Fuck it.So, I have a thing (.txt file) wherein I write opinions and such if they come to me at a convenient time -- which has been three times, as it turns out. I though I would post the three entries I've written, since maybe people will read it and subsequently tell me if I'm being a dumbass or not. There's some vulgar language, and some very roundabout sentences with very little point, but I've tried to keep everything in because otherwise I would be lying, and what's the point in that?I appologize if I sound pretentious, snowflake-y, or otherwise. On with the show.Thoughts on romance, feelings, the future, and self-worthI, in general, don't feel very happy; can I say I'm depressed? Probably not, no. I wouldn't want to, either, since I feel it would be a disgrace to those who have been properly diagnosed. All I've done is take the occasional online test when I feel at my worst.Depressed people typically talk about an empty feeling, or something similar to that. I don't think I've ever felt that; similarly, those with depression talk about being dull to emotions, which I don't think applies to me in the sense that I've always been kind of adverse to feeling.I find that my emotions go up and down, in an almost sine-wave form. This would be something more like bipolar disorder, but then that typically requires that the periods of time where I feel manic/depressed are relatively long, or that I feel manic at all. I can go from feeling perfectly okay, to feeling like I want to fucking die in approximately 15 seconds, and it might stay that way for hours but never longer than that. So it's not bipolar disorder.Depression gets ruled out again, as those who are depressed typically report always feeling like shit -- and I don't.I feel perfectly fine _most_ of the time, such as at school or with friends -- very rarely do I feel properly shit in these situations -- while as soon as I am put in a situation where I am alone, the bad feelings return. This typically results in very long nights of just staring at the ceiling wanting to die because I feel pointless. Other descriptors are available -- hopeless, useless, etc.Of course, it could just be hormones doing their thing.I look at /r/depression sometimes -- to see whether there's anyone who feels the way I do. Some complain about not having a girlfriend (inb4 mfw no gf), some complain that their lives are shit nonetheless. Those who complain about not having a girlfriend typically complain about being rejected by the one they like, or in general just unreciprocated love. I am in a relatively strange situation, I suppose, as I complain about not having a girlfriend but I also do not like anyone. I've never had an actual crush, nor love interest. There was a point when I thought I had a crush, but honestly I think I just went along with what I was supposed to do at my age.Now, of course there are plenty of girls I know that I would -- for lack of a better term -- like to fuck. Sexual attraction is not so much a problem, but I've never felt romantic love for someone, nor do I think anyone has felt romantic attraction towards me. These facts hurt me more than I feel they should, seeing as I put up a front of complete uncaring. I suppose that isn't so strange -- there are, in fact, very few things I care about -- but I thinkpeople like to judge me as an uncaring person, and then leave it at that; I don't exactly make it any easier for them to not do that, though. It's not like I have any form of social interaction.When I think of the future, I have great difficulty seeing myself in any other situation than complete loneliness.I mean, after I finish the (Generic School Program^TM), I doubt I'll be seeing most of my current friends ever again.On top of that, I don't think I can get new ones, so I see myself at 30, sitting in an empty, dark room contemplating suicide for 8 hours/day.Exactly how things will change I don't know, and honestly, I don't think they will. I think, however, that it would be a waste of life to just end it here, when I've only just turned 17 about a month and a half ago, and I should wait until there is some certainty that things aren't going to work out.I guess in reality, all I'm looking for is some meaning stemming from others. Since nothing has any inherent meaning, to assign meaning to actions you require the help of others. As such, whenever I make or do something, I would want feedback on it; some determination of its worth to tell me if I've wasted my time or not. To tell me if I'm making some kind of useful contribution to this world, no matter how small.Simple, right?Further thoughts on the possibility of a relationship -- or lack of oneWhat I've learnt by reading things on the internet is that if you speculate that you will never have a romantic partner, people will always respond by saying that you will eventually meet someone who likes you. I wonder if this is really true -- I mean, sure, statistically this is probably true for the overall population, but I'm not exactly part of the general population. I don't mean that in a ""oh, I'm special"" kind of way, but rather in a bad way.I mean, I'm fat, at most average looking, weak and I have relatively uncommon hobbies (mathematics, primarily). This means that finding someone who will be quite happy to hear me ramble on about some complex analysis bullshit is rather unlikely. Most people don't want to sit and talk about mathematics for hours on end (of course, the discussion on why people dislike mathematics so much is far too long to fit in this little entry), and I am quite annoyed by people who fake interest or joy. It just makes me feel bad -- I'm both boring the person, and I'm learning that my efforts to talk were completely pointless. This means I can sometimes be somewhat demanding regarding the reasoning for liking something I've done, as I simply don't trust that you do.A second reason I will likely not find a romantic partner is of course that you need to meet people for that to happen; I'm incredibly anti-social, as you may know. On top of that, a third reason is that if I somehow do find someone, maintaining a relationship isn't exactly trivial. I'm not sure I am even capable of it. First of all, you need to interact with the person on a regular interval -- which would be a problem for me. Second of all, sincerelationships are a two way street, it is quite easy to be emotionally dependent on the person and that can be quite mentally draining I would imagine, which decreases the chance of the relationship staying a relationship.I feel stupid for even existing.Thoughts on social paranoia(?) and friendshipsPerhaps social paranoia isn't the right term. Perhaps it's just pessimism, cynisism, or any other such -ism. Point is that I tend to feel sort of paranoid about people's opinion of me. In an unhealthy way, that is.I've found that I'm fully incapable of trusting what people tell me. When people tell me things, I tend to mentally tell myself that the person is just going along with the flow of the conversation to get it over with. For example, if I ask someone if I'm an overall good person, and the person says ""yes"", I will not believe them. I just won't be able to, because it feels more likely to me that they would be saying the easiest thing just to get the conversation over with as quickly as possible. So I feel paranoid and kind of shit because of this. The concept reminds me a bitof a Kafka trap. The more you assure me of what your point is, the less I believe you. A particularly annoying part about this is that it contributes to my need for acknowledgement by my peers, and as such is part of the reason I might repeatedly ask the same question to one person, which can be quite annoying I would imagine. Then the problem is that I can't really ask something -- going back to the previous example -- like""are you sure you're not just saying that to end the conversation topic as fast as possible?"" because the person would likely -- and rightfully -- assume that I'm making undue assumptions about them.A consequence of this paranoid behavior is, for example, that while I believe myself to have close friends, I assumethat I am no one's close friend.An example of this behavior happening just today is that my friend, who I will refer to as A, asked -- on the behalf of ""a group of 10-12 people"" -- whether I liked a girl whom I occasionally talk to at school -- one who most people, as I found out, find annoying. Now, the answer was of course ""no"". As mentioned in at least one previous entry, I've never felt any romantic emotions -- which is a source of great stress for me. After I replied, a couple of things were on my mind: Why do I not find this girl particularly annoying while most others find her extremely annoying? Is there anything wrong with my perception of people? Why did people assume I liked this girl because I talk to her, when I practically talk to everyone? Since A replied ""Alrite"", does that mean he believes me, or does it mean he's just saying that to end the somewhat uncomfortable topic?As you can see, I demonstrated this pessimistic, paranoid behavior in a situation where it really shouldn't be that difficult to determine the truth. I mean, A is one of my closest friends, so logically he shouldn't lie to me. However, once again this leads back to my behavior: while he is one of my closest friends, I have no evidence that he even enjoys my company. He might just be lying to me to avoid hurting my feelings unduly, since -- from my perspective -- we've been friends for quite the while.One of the worst things about this is that my brain tells me that perhaps everyone experiences this on a regular basis, and I'm the only one complaining and having my life be affected by it, which makes me feel like a massive piece of shit.On a semi-related note: I have no idea why anyone is friends with me. I'm a fuckin' asshole and I complain about things. I'm probably at least annoying.So, why are people friends with me? My brain says they're not, and that they're just lying to me in a rather well planned attempt at fuckin' with me.I feel fuckin' trapped.

473,"I dont know why Im writing this, Ive never wrote about my feelings or anything like that. Maybe I want to get my feelings in writing to help myself understand.I have friends I think. I hang out with people at my university, and when I go back home I spend time with my friends from high school. Yet most my life I havent felt like people have truly wanted me in their life. People still invite me to events and such, but this feeling stems from the little things.Its hard for me to explain the little things that make me feel unwanted. These little things are instances that in themselves are insignificant. Yet over time, such as when I reflect on the events of an entire week, it becomes clear that I am the lowest on the totem poll. Think of it like this, if 4 friends and myself were walking on a sidewalk that could only fit 3 people, I would be the odd man out. Its trivial situations like these that happen every day that really wear me down. At the same time, I see why Im the odd man out, I just cant seem to do anything about it. I say stupid things sometimes. Words that have no ill intent, yet the meaning is often lost. Id say the meaning is lost partly due to me just being dumb sometimes and partly due to my friends simply having a disposition to inperpret what I say in a certain way.

I introduced my high school friend to my roommate, and now we all hangout because we relate on many things. As the semester has progressed, both my roommate and my friend have bonded well.

477,"So... I've been around the block with my mental health. Figured a lot of stuff out, been in many different places with it over the last few months. Been kinda running at breakneck speeds around the block the last few weeks.My loved one left me. I admitted to them that i had failed again in trying to stop my pornography problem. It was a huge issue for them, and I knew this. I could either defend myself or condemn myself for that whole thing, but in the end it doesn't really matter. It's a behavioral addiction that was a huge struggle to try and stop, especially with the feelings of being shamed for it. But if I wanted to stop BADLY enough, I would have been able to.But regardless, I had managed to decide finally that I was completely done with it, and I was in a very... idk how to explain it. A mindset that was very open and honest with myself, and I really saw that admitting the truth was the right thing to do, or I would contantly feel like I was hiding a secret, even if I did put it entirely behind me. They didn't leave me right away. We said we could work through it, go to therapy, rebuild the lost trust.   A month and a halfish later they told me they wanted to break up. Didn't really have a good open conversation about it, but oh well maybe we can someday, maybe I'll get that closure someday of honest dialogue.But now I'm just cycling, going through everything from collected and optimistic to hopelessness and anger, everything in-between. Past couple of days, I've cycled back to a place of missing them very, very much. I'm still loving them a lot right now, and it really hurts.  I was off of the porn for that period we were still together, and another couple weeks after the break up too. This week I'm back on it though.I'm having trouble finding ways to fight it. Like, I'm not able to argue against 'hey you're just taking care of yourself' or 'what's wrong with giving yourself this pleasure' those kinds of thoughts and feelings. I keep believing I can 'handle it' or stuff like that.I got like, semi-instant karma for it last night. I fucked up somehow and downloaded some movies on my mobile data instead of wifi. 5 gigs at 10 bucks a gig: just completely threw away 50 bucks. Not counting the other 3 or so gigs from watching in the bathroom at work. Its like c'mon, why don't I feel that strongly as obvious signs that this is a bad idea? A poor excuse of a coping mechanism, continuing to feed into my lack of self-confidence and motivation. It's like I do see it, but only half the time. For a few hours until I'm horny again.Like I said, I've been going through cycles, so I've been focusing on other stuff too. Planning for the future, thinking about things I want to do, getting the ball rolling on getting some new healthy habits and stuff. So hopefully I will realize that falling back on this is standing in the way of the changes I want for myself. It's just so hard to go 'OK that's it,  relapse over'.... when there's just so much good fucking porn to watch, you know? Like it sounds stupid but that's the honest feelings. The long term looking out for myself thinking versus the instsant gratification drive. Neither truly needs to be an enemy, I just need balance. And there are other ways to treat yourself in the short-term. It's almost entirely a question of habit. I just have to find that will again.

We're currently long distance  (different countries) and just a few hours ago he opened up to me about how down he's been feeling. It sounds exactly what I was and still kind of am going through.It shattered my heart. I don't want him to feel this way. If I could take it off him and put it on myself I would. I hurt for him. I've never had a significant other struggle with the same thing. I don't know what to do. I want to help but I have no idea how other than listening and talking to him about it. I have no advice. He feels stuck in his current situation and cant do anything about it for another 2 months. If we weren't long distance then I could at least help out with physical things like cleaning up that I know are hard when you're suffering.He feels like everything is gray and boring/no motivation/things are pointless.TL;DR: Any advice on how to help my long distance boyfriend with his depression?

483,"Sorry, just wanna get a couple of things off my chest. Things have been really rough for a couple of years now and I have no friends or therapists I can approach.I was an unplanned/bastard, mixed child in a closed-minded society so I've been alienated by both family/peers all of my life. Never really had any friends, gave up on doing them years ago. Some years ago a grandma I didn't really know that well got a really aggressive, terminal type of cancer and I was the only one willing to take care of her as she was dying. She had been ostracized by our family since I could remember, but it turned out she might've actually been the sanest, most loving one of us all. She ended up dying in 4 months instead of the suggested 6, so a big chunk of my family blamed me for not ""saving her"". They haven't talked to me ever since.My nana, whom I loved unconditionally and whose death had been my biggest fear since I was born, started dying a few months later. On her deathbed she confessed she hated me, and thought my half brother had had a miserable life simply because I existed. Something definitely broke inside of me then.Later on, things appeared to get better. I got a scholarship and an acceptance letter for college in another country. I was happy to start anew. Now that I'm here I'm having quite a hard time. The institution is corrupt and teachers grade assignments based on affinity with the student. Not good at all considering I've gotten into shit with most of them. I work from 7am-10pm, and commute for 2 hours daily, weekends included. I'm getting seriously sick but still can't get any passing grades simply because I'm not getting friendly with the teachers. I've always been a honor roll student and an obnoxious tryhard so I'm quite convinced it's just the way things work here.Now my dad is going blind and, again, none of my siblings wants to help. I'm just considering dropping out, going back home and helping. He abandoned me when I was pretty small (got back in touch later on) so I'm just... wary.

In that time, I've had some of the most amazing adventures in my life and I'm genuinely happy with who I'm becoming. Doors are opening left and right for me and I've never been more financially stable and satisfied with what I do.

On a few occasions, I would buy a few things for the kids just so I can help contribute to a real Christmas for them.

12,"So a few weeks ago I quit my job and I started working at a restaurant across the street from my house. This restaurant seemed very convenient since it was so close and I would get tips, unlike my retail job. Although my retail job was actually pretty great when it came to having good coworkers, I thought it was worth it because I wouldnt have to uber or bus to work anymore since I dont have a car. Upon getting hired at the restaurant, I informed the manager/owner that I have to be sure about this job because my mom and I combine our checks to get by every month. He told me to quit and start working for him, which I did. When I started working there, he wasnt planning on paying me for training (I know its illegal but Im a fucking pushover and I didnt know what to do in that moment). So on my first day the Manager proceeded to insult me multiple times such as saying oh do you think the customer is gonna clean up his own table? When I actually checked on the customer multiple times and he was fine. That same night he told me to come dressed in a white button up and I didnt have one since he told me to wear black when I got hired. He told me to get a white button up at midnight and expected me to have it the next day. So the next day which is my second day of work I come to work in a black button up because thats all I had and I didnt have time to go to the mall which is pretty far from my house. He comes in and tells me I told you to get a white shirt, why arent you wearing a white shirt I explained that he told me on too short of notice and then he told me when I tell you to do something you do it, dont give me any excuses ok?. He constantly complained about how I was too slow but in reality he just expected too much from a server. He wanted me to make hookahs, pour alcoholic drinks (which I know nothing about), serve tables, be cashier and host all at the same time. Im 19 so making hookahs and pouring alcohol are illegal here in the US. (Three illegal things in a matter of two days)On my third day of work, which was my last day of work I opened the restaurant alone. The chef and the dishwasher were with me, I organized and cleaned the place up, took down reservations. All of a sudden two couples and a table of four comes in at the same time and its my third day so I get really overwhelmed. I had to get drinks, hookahs, food for all the tables and take phone orders all at the same time. I started panicking and I made a huge fool of myself because I was going very slow. A customer asked me to get her some kind of cocktail and I had no idea what the hell she wanted because once again I dont know shit about alcohol. She ended up going behind the bar and getting what she wanted. I almost dropped the hookah, I had to write everything down manually because I didnt know how to use the POS system very well yet. The chef was about to cry, I was about to cry. The Manager/owner finally decides to show up and starts yelling at me for making a mess of everything when in reality hes a cheap, irresponsible person who lets a new employee work alone on her third day in a fine dining restaurant. He starts telling me that I didnt do shit the entire day. He then proceeds to tell me that he speaks arabic with me, speaks English with me and I dont understand anything. (He and I both speak Arabic). Then I end up leaving because he tells me to go home, I told him I couldnt work there anymore if things were like this. This is where things get good: Im on my way home after quitting and being humiliated. I hear someone yelling me name across the street while Im on the phone with my mom on the verge of tears. I see that its one of the customers I had who was very nice to me. I walk up to her and she hands me 40 bucks. She asks me if I got fired and I just burst into tears at this point because I cant really not have a job since Im not financially stable. She tells me to wait and comes back and hands me another hundred and just holds me while I sob. I told her that I just couldnt handle the pressure and that Im sorry I fucked up her orders and everything. Her friends that were with her (one of which made fun of me and didnt realize that I heard him) all told me I did a great job and that nobody could handle the pressure I was under. One of them gave me a big hug and told me she was so proud of me and she just showered me with comforting words. She then told me that they gave my manager a piece of their mind, which made me feel so much better. They offered to take me home despite me living across the street. I got in the car and the lady that told me she was proud of me gave me another hundred bucks. When I got to my house they told me to stop crying and that everything would be alright. I couldnt believe how my night turned from thinking people were awful to understanding that theres still great people out there. I was truly amazed by their generosity and kindness. I will never forget these people. They were so good to me in my time of need. The interesting thing was, the woman that helped me had a name that translated into happiness in Arabic, and she truly lives up to her name by spreading love and care the way she did for me. God bless those people.(Sorry for the grammatical errors)TLDR: quit my job to work for a terrible person, he humiliated me in front of everyone at work, customers swooped in and saved the day.P.S: I ended up getting my entire check in full :) including training.",0,0,4.300000191,0.185568661,0.545477271,0.14024359,0.090297148,0.038413368

23,"TL;DR - Poor mental health does not mean a lack of mental toughness. Last October (2016) I had to part ways with my girlfriend of almost six years. I am bipolar so it put me in a horrible depression (made worse by cold weather elongated low cycles). It broke me, it was never that bad before. The drastic life change made my brain go haywire, worstening all my symptoms. Even after months of weekly therapy and almost doubled medication dosage I'm still broken. Amidst my pain, I showed up to work everyday regardless. It kept my mind busy and gave me purpose. When I snapped out of the deep lows in about March, mania cycles kicked in harder than ever before as well. I experienced almost daily severe anxiety with panic attacks. I eventually said  you to the anxiety and suicidal ideology, and used my anguish as motivation to fight harder than ever before... Last quarter I reported the best numbers in all of the Accounts Receivable department and got a new job within the company that comes with a 30% pay bump and I start Monday! I feel like I am living proof that poor mental health does not mean a lack of mental toughness. With support from my family and friends, my therapist, my psychiatrist, Van Halen, and a burning desire to overcome, I made it through the worst year of my life. My ex was very understanding and graceful about the break up and helped me get through the most. She is now my best friend and main support outside of my medical support.

44,"I met my partner in April of 2016, he had been diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis two years earlier and I knew what I was getting into. In May of 2016 he got the call that he would be receiving a new treatment called Lemtrada in June, I remember he was frustrated because it seemed so far away. He got his first infusions and other than a bit of fatigue he didn't experience many side effects, his team attributed this to him being one of the youngest male patients to be given the treatment. The treatment essentially smashes the lymphocytes that are attacking his myelin sheath, it's not a cure, it's a disease modifying drug and at current time the best hope is that his body will regrow new lymphocytes that won't attack his myelin.Over the next year we made some big steps, bought our first car, moved in together, he even started working part time at his brother in laws start up, when it came time for his next infusion we had to delay them because he had some issues with his teeth, he had been in an accident a while back and his root canals were becoming infected. July of 2017 he got his second round of infusions and other than a rash that went away after 2 benadryl he had no side effects! Now here we are, November of 2017, he had an MRI earlier in the month and on Wednesday we went to his neurologist to get the results of it, he was very nervous as he felt like he may be relapsing. His neurologist comes in with a big smile on her face, he has no new lesions! Ok so we're happy, then she tells us that the lesions he has haven't grown in size and are starting to heal!!!!!! Such freaking good news! She asked if over the past year and a half he had taken any sort of medication, other than his prescribed medical cannabis, and with the exception of 2 benadryl he hadn't.  She had looked through his records with his nurse before the appointment and wanted to confirm that. She then told him that she believes the cannabis helped him through the side effects of Lemtrada and she wants to start prescribing it to her other patients who will be getting Lemtrada!! She also is considering doing a case study on him for other neurologists because of his success!I know that was quite the read, but I'm so happy and excited that my wonderful partner is getting better and I've already bragged to all my friends and family so now I want to tell the whole interweb!Tl;Dr: Life is so amazing and science is so amazing and cannabis is so amazing!!!!!",0,0.100000001,1.600000024,0.087959148,0.224314302,0.205992699,0.065580688,0.416153133

I am somehow even more excited for graduate school than I was. :-)3) I somehow have been managing to hold two jobs (working roughly 26-28 hours per week) while taking eighteen credit hours this semester, and I am very proud of myself for it. I learned a lot about myself and what I am capable of, and I feel great! I've stepped outside of my comfort zone a lot this semester.

The poetry book is signed by the editor, who was a professor at my school before I came here, and the action figure just looked really cool (even though he looks like a bad guy).

I was having almost daily anxiety attacks. I couldn't focus in class and no matter how much effort I put into studying I was getting 60's on all my tests.Differential equations was particularly difficult to me as it focuses on all the aspects of math that I struggled with most in the past. Even with tutoring I only got a ~60 on my first test, out of two.After a particularly bad day and some dark thoughts, I decided enough was enough and got some help.I started seeing a therapist and psychiatrist and got some medicine to help. I slowly stopped having anxiety attacks and have felt better than I have in years.I took the second differential equations test last week and just got my grade back. An 88!!!

78,"I am so excited about this, I just had to post somewhere. My boyfriend knows to be proud but hes more into science and doesnt care for the finer points of what happened so hes just blindly saying good job! and offering to take me to dinner. I wrote a paper about a new historicist/feminist analysis of The Story of an Hour by Kate Chopin and my professor recommended I submit it to a research conference! I put it alongside A Dolls House, the Declaration of Sentiments, and Hills Manual and my professor said it was clearly very well researched. Im so excited!! This professor has also gotten increasingly tough on me since I took my first class with him, two semesters ago. This is the fourth class Ive taken with him and since he had a baby over the summer hes gotten MUCH tougher, so I know his praise is very genuine. He still grades me fairly but since he knows my writing so well he gives me very candid and detailed feedback. (An entire single spaced page plus written margin commentary that often spills over.) He praised it so much and Im so proud of myself. I really respect that hes always been honest and told me when I can do better (like when I wrote a B paper that definitely would have been an A like I usually get if I put any effort into proofreading but he knew I didnt try because my overall course grade would still be A because I had maxed out extra credit) and I know he wouldnt advise me to submit if he didnt absolutely mean it. He said that my writing has come really far and I know hes right. This paper is a thousand times better than anything I could have written two semesters ago and its actually something to be proud of. I used to be ashamed to have professors read my essays because I knew I could do better but I just kept getting stuck because I would get As anyway because in general in my English department professors are really lenient about grading because they know a lot of people want to go on to grad school where GPA counts for a lot. I knew it wasnt my best and he was the first professor to completely call me out on the fact that while my ideas were good and my presentation was great it was clearly a paper that was making the least work possible look like the best thing possible. He pushed me to do better and I did. I have no idea what this means, as I havent met with him one on one to discuss it further, but I know at the very least it is very high praise from someone I respect. I am almost certain Ill submit it like he recommends, and I might ask for his help submitting it several other places too if its as good as he says it is.

As cheesy as it sounds.My boyfriend was completely and totally my hero yesterday. I stopped for gas on my way home from his house, about a 20 minute drive, and when I got home I couldn't find my wallet. In my panic, I managed to lock my keys in my car, and I panicked even more. I called up my hubby, not exactly begging for help, but it was the first thing that came to mind when I was distressed. I didn't ask him to come over but he rushed over in the middle of whatever he was doing, stopped at the gas station to look for my wallet (wasn't there though), and then came to my house. He then spent the next 30 minutes or so helping me break into my own car (thank god for the guy who taught me how to, since this is the second time now). My boyfriend was the one who managed to get my car open, and immediately found my wallet. It was wedged in a crack under the passenger seat. My boyfriend left for a work related dinner, and during the time he was gone, I managed to upset both of my parents by making a tiny mistake. I accidentally let the cats ruin the dinner I cooked.

He bought me comfort food on the way there, and then when we get the game he surprises me with my own copy. He bought both of us games.

86,"I started writing a post but before I was half way done with it was a wall of text. Ive got it typed up on google docs if anyone wants to see it Ill post it but Ill stick to bullet points. Supposed to graduate high school in 2004. Had to take an extra year due to being short a few credits. Delayed again when it came up I was short on classes that were not mentioned before. I delayed myself by another year (2006) by focusing on WoW rather then doing the 2 weeks worth of work to graduate. (2006)Wash dishes for a month and decide that I need to go back to school. Spend the next 4 years working only 2 years and always part time but part of it going to school. (2008) Stop going to school because my mom made to much by FAFSA standard even though she couldn't afford to help me with school. I have to wait until winter 2010 to go back. Unemployed for 2 years. Felt like killing myself several times for being worthless. Land a job at a mom and pops thanks to two guys from highschool. Work there part time, school full time for two years. Literally walked 2-2.25 miles to work and school everyday, uphill and downhill, and even in the snow on the rare occasions. Sometimes doing HW at work between class and work. Right before I graduate 1. Fafsa sends me more money because they had it laying around. Bought a car with it. 2. A local hospital lays off 100 employees in the field Im going into. Graduate, cant find a job in that field for two years. Stay at mom and pops making minimum wage for another 2-ish years but moving to head manager. Land a job at my current company $11.50/hour to $16.XX/hour. Start saving for a house. Car accident two years ago that wiped out the 5k I had started saving. Bought a new car but had car payments, silver lining - I learned I had high credit because I was approved for a $20k auto loan Buy a new car in September of 2015 with the assumption it will last for many years. Paid off new car Before Thanksgiving 2016. Small raise at work to $17.XX an hour. Sit down with my boss at lunch. Ask him ""whats the difference between my job (entry level) and (next step up?"" ""Nothing with everything you can do that's why Ill get you a big raise."" Currently - Boss got me the raise from $17.XX/h to $25/h. It came in on half my paycheck today. Checked bank balance - 18k saved at the moment. This time last year I paid off the 13k on my car.Ive stopped buying video games and comic books ($100 a month on comics alone not to mention bags, boards, and boxes) so not only will my raise be a nice boost but Ill keep some extra money. If I can keep saving like this I estimate that Ill be at 42k saved by the end of next year. That will be enough for a decent down payment on a house so I can finally move out of my moms house and live on my own at sadly 33 but better late then never.  -",0,-0.100000001,3.900000095,0.834574997,0.061988451,0.014159319,0.041518685,0.047758527

I gave him a $5 bill and told him to get whatever he wanted. He smiled, shook my hand, asked me for my name, told me his, and said thank you. I left feeling a bit confused, he looked homeless. He had both legs amputated, and when I did speak to him I got the feeling he wasn't all there mentally. I felt a bit dumb for giving him the $5, thinking maybe he just played the victim card and got some money out of me.

It's been a lot of the same, I'm the superstar employee that is always overlooked when there's an opportunity for advancement. All of my supervisors were nowhere near as experienced and capable as I was at keeping the shift together when they got bumped up over me. It definitely stung, even though I just went along with it.Then suddenly 2 months ago everything changed. The restaurant manager (The main boss) just up and quit on pretty short notice. Plans for succession were all of a sudden in the works, while it was still unconfirmed who was getting it, there was a de facto leader everybody assumed was going to be it.To my surprise, the owner took me aside several days after the manager quit and offered to make me a supervisor. I said yes of course, and I went along my happy way, content with what I had been given. I respected my fellow supervisors for their experience, and defaulted to the de facto leader.Today was a shocker to everybody, I was once again pulled aside, this time I was given the manager position. I once again accepted, and the owner made the announcement that I am now in charge. I'm still in shock, I had some suspicions that I was going to be the one, but I don't think I ever let myself believe it. I know I deserve it more than anybody else, I just never expected somebody would ever be willing to take a leap of faith with me.

105,"I was in a not-at-fault accident just under a year ago and I've been struggling with memory ever since. My short term memory was awful, I forgot all of my friend's names, and it feels like I lost an entire year of school between the accident right before finals and struggling to remember new information. Professor pity and some doctor's notes got me through last winter's finals, and last semester was just me coasting through school and hoping that luck would carry me. It was absolutely horrible, and even though my marks were really good, I felt like I should've taken the year off because of the stress and self-doubt. I honestly told people around me that I felt retarded in the medical sense... slowed down, stupid, useless, and thinking like I was back in grade school and lost all my process from high school onward. I had to re-learn how to do basic math despite acing calculus in my first year of university, I had to re-learn all of my old courses based on old notes, and I spent more all-night study sessions in the living room than I care to admit because I completely lost my ability to focus. But the worst one, I think, was the first time I saw my friends after an accident and realized I didn't know what a single one was named. One of them even had the same first name as me and I had no idea. They tried to lighten the situation and poke fun at it, but I left crying. That came right after my make-up exams and it was the exact moment I realized how much I'd lost.Well, I'm approaching the one year mark, it's a whole new semester, I just finished my midterms... and I finally feel confident again! I'm able to go into midterms feeling pretty good and I'm getting A's in everything! I'm still struggling with self-doubt, but so far it's all been going fine. I'm not having nearly as much trouble understanding lectures in real-time, my courses are making sense even though they're harder, and I'm actually having motivation to do my work during daylight hours, which is huge. It's still a really big struggle to get anything done before sunset, and I'm still having a lot of moments where I forget how to talk for a bit, but I'm honestly doing so much better, and it's wonderful. I'm remembering things so much more than I'm forgetting them now. There was a long time where I wondered if I'd ever see this again. And it's right now. I never thought I'd be able to take something as simple as short-term memory for granted, but I never will again!Another good thing... I got all those names back.

132,"Doesn't matter what it was about, it's the type that isn't easy. You know the ones, where no one wants to address it but you both know it's there and can't be ignored.We sat on opposite couches and fiddled with our phones for a while, waiting for the other to speak. And finally someone did.And so we talked. We laid out our innermost feelings that are usually only acknowledged by yourself and perhaps a diary. Our hopes and insecurities, our love for each other and commitment to making things work.There was nothing bad about what happened. It was constructive and difficult but we came out all the stronger for it. Love is work, to paraphrase a wonderful post I saw on reddit years ago: it's a conscious effort to wake up every morning and say I am going to work for not only myself but my person as well. There are no fairy tales or soul mates and people will be people, with poor communication or lack of it entirely being what I believe is the principle divide.I want to emphasize that I have a wonderful relationship and feel loved and supported and do my best to reciprocate or outdo what I receive. The feeling of handling an adult conversation like adults and being able to say ""I love and appreciate you, we'll do better"" at the end of it is an amazing feeling of success.

I mean, can we just take a moment to appreciated the fact that we're sitting on a little rock in space, yet there just so happens to be so much to love about it? Like, seriously, we get to make art, we get to enjoy music, we get to tell jokes, to laugh at jokes, to eat ice cream, to drink water, to feel the breeze, to see the sunset, to have friends, to ask a random person on the street for a high-five and probably get one, to think, to do whatever the hell makes us happy! For god's sake, we have birds! BIRDS! Just these things with feathers that fly around and sing! That's just there for us to enjoy! You ever seen a person with a nice smile? Why do smiles exist? What are the odds that something capable of smiling just happened to develop naturally in some weird rock moving around a ball of fire? Why are we not all smiling all the time? We live on Earth, you maniacs! Far as we know, this is the best place in the universe! Stop being not happy! Go play with a dog or something, I don't care, but enjoy it, because you only get a short time to do it. Wait, hold on, no, you get 80 GODDAMN YEARS! What are people talking about, ""ooh we only get a short time in this life look at me i'm a nihilist."" How does 80 years not strike you as a mindbogglingly long time?

FUCKING GOOGLE!FUCKING!G O O G L E !I just hit ctrl+t, typed a few simple words, and found out how many seconds are in 80 years, without having to do any math! That's insane! We're basically gods! When did you last stop to appreciate how nuts the internet is? Ever wondered how many species of butterflies there are? Me neither! Apparently it's ~20,000, though. I know that now. How can it be possible that I know that without ever having studied butterflies at all? You want a picture of a tree with a hat? [Boom!](https://cdn.decoist.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Small-cowboy-themed-Christmas-tree-with-hat.jpg) Why does that picture exist?

Rats don't live very long (2-3 years is the average in the UK), but they have a habit of forming a close bond with their owners which they later break when they pass on. We choose to rescue two rats, and I'm determined to make their short little lives full of adventure. They don't know what halloween is, but they sure enjoyed exploring the haunted mansion I made for them out of cardboard (featured as a background prop in the video.)After we had some leftover pumpkin; I had planned on just giving it to them for their dinner when I remembered a hamster-friendly pumpkin pie recipe I'd found on youtube. So there I was, mixing flour and peanut butter and rolling it into a pie shape, filling it with some mashed pumpkin then using a chopstick to stab a smiley face into the top (they're fearless, there was no point in a spooky face). I baked it and once cooled offered it to the ratties as a treat during their free range time.They loved it and kept trying to steal it from me; I've never had to wrestle food from my girl, Nova, so much!

This week was the best I had ever made, I got paid (I get paid a percentage, so I get paid in cash, pay my own taxes at the end of the year as most people in my line of work are 1099 by the Subcontractor) on my way home from work I stopped by a grocery store gas station and grabbed milk for my kid and pumped gas.Apparently I either dropped my wallet from my pocket, or laid it in my car through the window and it fell out when I opened the door, really Im not sure. I left and didnt notice it was gone till about 30 minutes later when I went to pay a bill and the wallet wasnt in my pocket... at which I drove back to the store (about 15 mins down the road) and the attendant told me someone had turned in the wallet to lost and found... I checked lost and found, it wasnt there...I filed a police report, tried everything I could to find the wallet, waited at the store for 2 hours, when I get a phone call from a company we occasionally do flooring for, telling me this gentleman is trying to find me to turn in my wallet.

172,"Forgive me for this long text and for my english as it might have a lot of mistakes.I started working at this company last year (1 year and 6 months now) and it was just the usual depressing factory job. Past 6 months, after a lot of trouble trying to click with the person I was working with (he was very difficult to work with, especially with people who were beginners), I asked my team leader if it was possible to change places and have another task.There was one. Probably the most physical job in the whole company. You literally had to walk 15Km or 9 miles for my American friends, everyday. At least that was my average. Carry hundreds of containers everyday. Containers weighing from 10Kgs to 15Kgs (22lbs to 33lbs). Working 6 days straight. 7 days straight once a month. The schedule changes every week. One week 08:00 - 16:00, the next 16:00 - 00:00 and the next 00:00 - 08:00 and repeat. My arms have ""black marks"" (I don't know what to call it but, it's that mark you get after your muscle gets injured and becomes yellowish, sometimes purple) from carrying stuff around and can't seem to lose them as I really don't have enough time off work for them to heal completely. My hands are not pretty even though I use gloves most of the time. My back hurts, my legs too. Sometimes, exhaustion, ironically, doesn't let me sleep. Even though it was difficult, I gave it my all every single day. They needed someone for extra hours, I was there. They needed someone for the heavy lifting, I was there. Someone to work on day offs, I was there. I sacrificed a lot on a personal level to be able to work and provide for my parents. After all this time, I started thinking if all this hard work would lead me somewhere and kept imaginating scenarios. But the reality was, with my level of education, I was probably condemned to be doing this job for my whole life as in every job offer the company had, you needed to be an engineer to be able to climb through the ranks. Honestly, I didn't want that for me, so I seriously started thinking about finding another job. Yesterday, after my lunch break finished, I went back to work. As of minutes, I see my two team leaders approaching me and telling me that they needed to talk with me. I said sure, without any idea what was coming my way. I just thought they had a task for me and wanted to explain it to me. I followed them and I see them entering the meeting room and my immediate thought was ""Shit shit shit, am I getting fired, did I fuck up somewhere?"" I don't know why did I think this as I knew I had done nothing wrong, but that was all I could think. After a brief silence, they start telling me that all year long, they have noticed how hard I've worked and how dedicated to my job I am, how passioned... At this point, all I'm thinking is ""Is this happening? What in the blue hell is happening?"" They kept telling me that I was a very good worker and that I was very dedicated, etc etc. I just wanted them to go straight to the point!!  After all this, they said it. ""We're offering you a new position."" I started stuttering A LOT (not a good first impression, I know), but I knew I had to be calm and composed so I, successfully, tried my hardest. They gave me a brief description of the position they were offering and how serious it was, if I was ready for the new resposabilities and so on. After thinking about everything they said, I accepted! They did congratulate me and told me to not ever think that hard work goes unnoticed. They still didn't know when I'm going to start with my new tasks as they still had to communicate with their higher ups that I had accepted the offer. Then they said ""That's all"" and I asked if could get back to work.After I left the room, my legs and hands were shacking HARD. I never thought this would be possible. I went to the bathroom, called my parents to tell the news and god, were they happy.  I can't wait to start and I've never been so motivated to work again. All because now I know that all that hard work wasn't for nothing.I just want to add up that if you're in a similair situation, don't give up. There's almost always someone watching your hardwork, and even if that hard work doesn't get you higher, just be happy for yourself because you gave it your best shot.Thanks for reading and have a good day!",0,0,3.200000048,0.286605597,0.026654279,0.108630829,0.065090761,0.513018608

We kept up a long-distance relationship for almost a year before meeting.2014: I got picked for an amazing, very well-paid internship at the company Id always dreamed of working for. In addition, I got to live rent-free by house-sitting for a multi-millionaire the entire summer I was at the internship.At the end of the internship, I was offered an incredible job, which I was to start January 5, 2015, two weeks after I graduated. I was elated.Plot Twist - a huge management layoff occurred, and I was laid off before ever starting, on December 20, 2014. My old Director and I had become friends, and he sent out a recommendation letter as soon as he heard what happened, and less than 4 hours after being laid off, I got offered a job from a consultant Id worked with, which had the exact same pay, and I didnt even have to interview. I graduated in December 2014 with my Bachelors in Biology and a Minor in Environmental Sustainability.2015: I moved to a new state and got my first apartment on January 9, right on a lake with a wrap-around balcony and awesome fishing. Two days later, my then-girlfriend traveled over 1,000 miles to move in with me. Id never been so happy. In addition, my wifes parents are some of my favorite people. No jokes, no sarcasm, I have the best in-laws in the world.I started my new, job on January 19, 2015, and even got a corner office since one was available. By the end of the year, I got my performance review... out of 5, 3 was meets all expectations. I got a 5, a personal review from our regional manager that put all of my scores higher than my self review, and a great raise.During the year, my wife and I traded my truck and her car and bought a car together, which Id been told by my family Id never be able to afford for at least 5 years.By May, I proposed on the spot my wife and I first met, and we were married by October 2015. We had an incredibly small wedding, nestled in the most beautiful little town Ive ever seen, right in the heart of the mountains in east Tennessee.During the year, we met an awesome couple and have been great friends ever since. In addition, we lost my wifes dog, but adopted a beautiful border collie/Lab mix named Lady, who is the most gentle, loveable dog imaginable.On top of all this... Im adopted, and without me knowing, my amazing wife somehow tracked down my biological mother, who turned out to be a veritable saint. Shes one of the greatest people Ive ever met, married to a man Im honored to know, both of whom immediately became a permanent part of our lives. Thats a story in itself.There were times that first year that were hard - our apartment looked amazing at first and turned into a horror show (so many stories about it), we had medical issues and at one time, had $0.38 to our name, as well as my adoptive family rejecting us entirely. Id do it all over again.2016: In February, my wife and I began trying for a kid, and to our eternal surprise, she got pregnant within 2 weeks. Plot twist - wed moved to a new apartment two months before, and about the time we found out my wife was pregnant, we found out our neighbor was stalking us. Terrifying time, so many stories.We finally move out of that apartment and away from our stalker, into a brand new, gorgeous apartment that was finished 3 days before we actually moved in.November - our son, James, is born on 11/11/16. He was born early, and was a lil fella, but was the greatest thing to ever happen to us. Im so proud of my son I cant stand it, and my wifes calling in life is to be a mother. Im humbled daily by how amazing of a mother she is.2017: In March, we drove from Florida to Iowa to visit where my wife grew up and where her brothers still live. It was a great time. Two weeks later, we find out that my brother-in-law and his wife were approved to adopt a beautiful baby girl, after trying for 5-10 years to have a child. She was adopted from Florida, so they were able to stay with us for a few days after leaving the hospital with her, and theyre both such incredible parents.In three weeks, were celebrating my sons first birthday, and its unbelievable how fast this year has gone by.I end this by say that these have been the hardest, most challenging years of my life.

211,"STORY TIMEOk it may not sound like much to a lot of yall but to me this is a 12 year goal finally completed. Bad in 2nd grade I decided that I wanted to be an Infantryman in the Army, and since then that has been my goal. When I was a Freshman in high school I was told I had congenital lobar emphazyma and that one third of my right lung had to be removed. No biggie right? Wrong. Little did I know that the military considers that to be and automatic disqualifier, meaning I couldn't join, but I did not care. My senior year of high school I applied to the University of North Georgia and their ROTC program and i was accepted. Having not forgot about my original goal, in the summer between my senior year of high school and my freshman year of college i walked into the recruiting office at the local recruiting depot with the goal of enlisting. More on that later. My first semester of college went ok, got a 2.6 GPA but wasn't too happy there. Second semester was horrible, 1.6 GPA and miserable the entire time, and all the while trying to figure out my enlistment paperwork and the headache that was caused by my lung surgery. After my freshman year of college i decided that college isn't for me right now, so I dropped out, still continuing the goal I set back in second grade. Come around a month ago things really started to pickup in my enlistment process. I was approved to go to MEPS, however, me and my recruiter both knew I would ""fail, meaning the doctor there would fail me and require me to get a medical waiver. I went, and by the stroke of god that is exactly what happened. So after that my recruiter was finally able to submit my medical waiver (to the Army this means, if approved, it's as if my surgery never happened) but these kinds of waivers are very rarely approved. 3 days ago he submitted it and told me it was no longer in his hands and we juat had to play the waiting game, which could very well take months. As of 3 hours prior to writing this I got a call from my recruiter as I'm sitting at my desk playing games with my friends. I pick up the phone and this is what follows. R ""Hey man I got some news for you, they denied your waiver."" Me ""Fuck man, now what do we do."" Recruiter ""Nah man I'm just fucking with you, they approved your waiver and you're all set to join the military."" At this point I leap out of my chair and run out of my room to tell my parents I'm going to join the military. Oh, I'm also balling my eyes out at this point from excitement and reliefe. We talk some more and in two weeks I will be signing my contract to officially join the US Army. Sorry for the long ass story but I really felt I had to get this out. Now marks hour 3 that I have had a smile on my face. Yall have a great day, thanks for reading. ",0,-0.300000012,5.099999905,0.35984534,0.368731201,0.135775387,0.08618965,0.049458347

She finds me attractive as well and compliments me regularly, and will sometimes joke about doing more-than-friendly things with me, but she's never made any kind of moves.

So I never made any moves, because who wants to be that person to make things weird with a good friend?But yesterday, as we were hanging out at my place, there was just a really intimate vibe between us throughout the day, and we made casual affectionate contact a lot more than we usually do. But again, we're already very close so I didn't want to read too much into it. As I was driving her home, she basically confessed to me that she actually would be perfectly fine if something intimate happened between us.

229,"I've never posted to r/happy before, only scrolled and been inspired, but finally today I feel halfway worthy of posting. An attempt at quick background:  All my life I have been fascinated by medicine and science but always assumed I wasn't smart enough to be a real doctor, typically scoring average or only a little above average. About 4 years ago after my first year in undergrad I had a drastic change of attitude and decided I will never be what I want I don't try... I am currently on my 5th and final year of my Biology degree with all additional credits for both the MCAT and required by US medical schools. I struggled and literally scraped by all the chemistries, re taking general 2 and organic 1 twice. I got an academic scholarship to an out of state school so there I went, only to find out that the scholarship only lasted 4 years. This year I am full out of state tuition, and I ALMOST had to transfer back into my state for only  my final year, which would completely change where my degree was from, even if I went to USC for 4 of 5 years. Due to some amount of privilege I am ever grateful for, my parents are just barely able to financially support me through my last year in combination with some student loans, but it HAD to be my last year (of undergraduate).Alongside these facts my final requirement for the MCAT and medical school (other than highly specific biology courses to finish my major) is the notorious physics class I am in now, the physics of electricity, magnetism and optics. Again I must re iterate friends I am no genius, in fact I often feel like I'm pretending among other really smart people, but this course wasn't an option if I want to even apply to medical school. So I go to class, take notes etc, read the text book, all normal requirements, and I got a whopping 3 points on my first exam. For writing my name correctly, impressive. Come one month later my second exam is coincidentally timed to be on the exact date (today) that my university has declared the cut off date to drop a course with out WF- which is basically quitting halfway through with out failing, but you get no money back. This course alone out of state ran me over 3 grand. I studied so long and so hard but I was sooo nervous I had no idea how it went. There was even a small riot at the end of the exam, people demanding we get out scores before the cut off date. It seemed like everything was on the line... This evening my poor friend I studied with texted me and said, the scores are up, I got a 3 again, I have to drop. I knew I was fucked, this guy was so organized compared to me, scatter brained and freaking out. I got an 82 on the exam!!! I really got a B on this exam. I just want to cry. Everything seems to be okay again, and the delayed gratification combined with surprising myself is the sweetest satisfaction I can possibly think of in this moment. I hope anyone reading this (and anyone in general) has had a happy day as well, and if not there is tomorrow, there is always tomorrow!!",0,-0.200000003,2.599999905,0.19183594,0.420143247,0.182611316,0.083445162,0.121964373

I was at dinner with these guys I was hanging out with who I didn't really like but figured it was better than sitting alone and then this girl came over and sat with us.We didn't say much at first but instead joined in the group conversation. But eventually we got talking to each other and I can't remember the last time I've just hit it off with a person so quickly. Before I knew it the other guys had left and it was just us at the dinner table.After dinner we just explored the huge house we were staying in and went outside and looked at the stars and just talked and talked and she makes me so happy it's insane. Bearing in mind this was on the first day, so from then on we basically spent the whole weekend together just doing random shit and having the best time. I kept thinking she'd get sick of me or I'd get sick of her but we just kept finding things to do and talk about.We got back yesterday and chilled at hers for ages, and we're meeting up tomorrow to go to a bar. This isn't even like a romantic thing I don't think at least not right now, I'm just so happy to have someone like that.

233,"This past year has been the lowest and surprisingly highest points of my life and its not even over yet.  This time last year I was burned out from working at a hospital and spending my time off with my girlfriend whom I was also getting burned out from (4 years, 4 different times cheating, forgave her 3 times) I ditched the job and the girl and fulfilled a childhood dream.  I opened my own comic store which has been doing well overall.  Stressful but doing well.  I've also found someone new.  She's now my fiance and we live together with 2 awesome cats, getting married next October!  Its so amazing to me that I was able to do this.  Up until recently I had very little self worth.  A failed marriage that was like prison followed immediately by a toxic relationship took 9 years of my life.  Didn't think I was worth the dirt I walked on.  Even owning the comic shop didn't really make me feel any better.  I mean I was doing what I had always wanted to do but I still felt low.  Then I met her.  She's beautiful, and smart, and funny, and while our relationship has been going very fast I wouldn't have it any other way. People always tell us we're so perfect and blah blah blah (humble brag) but the truth is we have had some pretty serious moments that could have torn our relationship apart.  But we are open about everything.  We say how we are feeling and boom. 15 minutes later the arguments are over.  We empathize with each other and are able to take ourselves out of the situation and look at it from a different point of view. I didn't know that something like this existed.

251,"Tl;dr at the end.On October 12th, 2001 my mother lost her battle to cancer after being diagnosed on October 12th 1999. I was 17. It destroyed me. She raised my by herself and was my only family (I'm an orphan now, with no living blood relatives, they all died when I was kid). Then, today at 7 pm, I read this article: http://birthmoviesdeath.com/2017/10/12/trent-reznors-releasing-a-cover-of-john-carpenters-halloween-theme-tomorrow/amp And for the first time on this day I'm crying because I'm happy. See my mother introduced me to John Carpenter films when I was a kid, her having a crush on Kurt Russel and Jeff Bridges helped (she loved Starman and Escape From NY). Watching Escape From NY was mind blowing and made me a John Carpenter fan for life. She even took me to see John Carpenter's Village of the Damned in theaters (I was like 10 and hid behind the seats for most of it).Then I discovered Halloween. Hands down my favorite film of all time. My favorite theme. My favorite everything. It, in it's own way, helped me cope with my mother's cancer (as an adult I realized it was because Myers became cancer and Laurie was my mother). My mother and I always watched movies together, it was all we could do because we were so poor. She loved John Carpenter's films and so do I. I had the pleasure of meeting him once and he was kind and amazing. I bought a meet and greet ticket for one of his tour stops in 2016. He went out his way for me, a fan, because I could only afford one ticket so my wife couldn't be there, who I've turned into a Carpenter fan (They Live is her favorite, we're seeing it in theaters on Halloween this year!). John Carpenter had a security guard find me so he could talk with me again in which he bought my wife a ticket for the show. Which allowed me to write the best text I've ever sent to anybody ever: John Carpenter just bought you a ticket. So a couple of nights ago, drunk and sad not looking forward to today (I also lost my 17 year old cat 6 months ago, who knew my mother and was my sweet baby girl) I went on Amazon and bought every single John Carpenter film I didn't own yet (except Cigarette Burns because I forgot about it). It made me feel better. They started arriving today, and will be arriving randomly for the rest of the month. Trent Reznor, and NIN is my favorite musician. His music, especially The Fragile: Left, has always been a solace in moments of darkness for me. It's a cathartic experience for me to listen to that disc and his music is always inspiring me to keep fighting my depression while sparking the creative part of my brain. I tend to write just listening to Reznor's music (often Ghosts 1-4). He's even covered two of my favorite pieces of music (Greig's In the Hall of the Mountain King and Led Zeppelins Immigrant Song). A friend brought me to see him live for my 31st birthday and It was the greatest concert ever. Today was hard for me. It was the first anniversary of her death without my cat, next year I will have spent half my life with a mother and without, and I've been sad all day, letting that day 16 years ago play on repeat in my head. Just after 7 pm, on the day my mom died, was when a friend's father put his hand on my shoulder, looked me in the eye and started to speak. I fell to the floor before he finished. As that was replaying through my head I saw that news article and just started crying tears of joy. Of all the days for that to be announced. It broke me out of the sad and depressed funk I've been in (and that I always get this time of year). Thank you serendipity. This smile is for you. :Dtl;dr: 16 years ago today my mother died. We shared and loved John Carpenter films, Halloween being my favorite. Trent Reznor's music helps me fight my depression, and has since she died. At 7 pm today, when 16 years ago I found out my mother died, I see an article posted today that Trent Reznor is releasing a cover of John Carpenter's Halloween theme tomorrow. It caused a cathartic flow of happy tears on what's usually the saddest day of the year for me. ",0,0.200000003,6.699999809,0.334008426,0.211521089,0.096654698,0.202707708,0.155108094

The plot of the new episode was totally stupid but the point was really about calling back to as many jokes and catch phrases as possible. Episode 401 was titled ""Happy to Be Here.""Basically the premise is that after the series finale, Brad and Jane had a big fight about her moving to Tokyo to take a job at Toyota (although Alex thinks she works at Toy Yoda, a company that exclusively makes little green Jedis from Star Wars). Their fight breaks up the entire group (unlike the Alex and Dave break up at the start of the series. Get it? the opposite thing happened) so no one has spoken for the last 939 days.In the last 3 years, Penny got married and divorced three times to guys she met on Kid Rock cruises. Max moved to DC. Alex turned Xela into a Fortune 500 company and moved to London. Jane runs Toyota's sex doll department in Tokyo. Dave made a food truck with Paul Haggis called Haggis' Haggis but Paul screwed him so now Dave is recreating the road trip from Chef. Brad went off the grid and lives in the woods getting raped by bears. They really went off the rails with the Brad storyline.So the plot of the episode is that Max and Penny want to reunite the gang to go to Scotty's funeral (Scotty's dead). Eventually everyone returns to Chicago, Brad and Jane reunite, and Alex reveals she got Scotty to pretend to be dead to get them all together. But twist! Scotty actually did die! Penny has to go sing Torn at his funeral, because his head was torn off while riding a Sea-Doo. To which Dave replies: Sea-Doo? More like Sea-Don't!Then Dave awakes suddenly, and Alex says ""Bitch it is 5:30!""

Also, in ""Barefoot Pedaler"" Dave and Alex aren't getting along similar to early in the season, So this episode should be earlier, as in my original order:My original order:1 Pilot	2011-04-13    2 Bo Fight	2011-05-18    3 Barefoot Pedaler	2011-05-18    4 Dave of the Dead	2011-05-04    5 The Quicksand Girlfriend	2011-04-13    6 Of Mice & Jazz Kwon Do	2011-05-04    7 Mein Coming Out	2011-04-20    8 Your Couples Friends & Neighbors	2011-04-20    9 You've Got Male	2011-05-11    10 The Girl With The David Tattoo	2011-05-11    11 Like Father, Like Gun	2011-04-27    12 The Shershow Redemption	2011-05-25    13 Why Can't You Read Me?     2011-08-24    Now this makes sense in that the food truck storyline is more in order. But, to me, it seems incorrect that ""The Quicksand Girlfriend"" is no longer in the 2nd slot. In that episode, Dave is rebounding, Alex is looking for a new roomate (both make sense after a failed wedding) and Derrick is introduced (which makes sense for a new character introduction to happen in S01E02 in a new series).What episode Does Dave move in with Max? Alex wouldn't look for a new roomate until Dave moves out. Did the episodes originally air out of order?

342,"Allow me to present a theory on how they could relaunch Happy Endings given where they left the series and what all of the actors are currently up to.----Season 4, Episode 1: Alex and Dave finally got married!  The episode opens with the gang all together at the airport seeing the newlyweds off.  For their honeymoon Dave has insisted that he and Alex go explore his Cherokee roots for an undetermined amount of time.  (This allows Zachary and Elisha to pursue their current projects but keeps the door open for their return at any point.)  The six friends talk about what's been going on the past two years, and we are treated to some flashbacks of the wedding (Max made out with the priest!  During the ceremony!) and other adventures (Dave was run over by his own food truck giving him a big insurance payoff).  The scene ends with Dave and Alex boarding the plane in slow motion while sentimental music plays and the camera cuts back and forth to the characters looking at each other with bittersweet emotions except for Max who is stuffing his face with a giant ""Barry Bond's CinnaBon-Bon"" that was introduced in an earlier joke.  After A&D board, Brad remarks that they should probably go since the TSA will be here any minute.  A cop is seen headed their way riding one of those airport golf carts.  The four remaining characters start to run away while Jane yells that she told them they should have just said goodbye outside instead of sneaking through security.  Out of breath even though he's only run a few steps, Max replies with something about sticking it to ""The Man.""  The scene ends with the comically slow security cart rolling by in hot pursuit.In the next scene, Brad, Jane, Max, and Penny are at Rosalita's talking about how they narrowly escaped arrest.  Penny tells everyone that now that Dave and Alex are gone she can finally introduce them to her new boyfriend.  ""Oh here he is now.  Guys, meet Rick!""  Rick waves.  Brad: ""Rick Rickman?  Dave's old psychiatrist?""  (Who was played by Ken Marino, currently starring in ""Merry Me"" with Casey Wilson).  Rick explains that Dave was never technically his patient because he only ever paid Rick with vintage Bulls trading cards.  Penny explains that she always liked Rick, but she didn't want to hurt Dave's feelings.  Now that Dave's gone she and Rick can start dating again.  Max says he's not crazy about betraying Dave's trust, but Rick is at least better than the last guy she was with.  Cut to Penny making out with the same priest!  During someone else's wedding ceremony!----So there you have it.  We lose Alex and Dave (hopefully just temporarily), but we get Jake from ""Marry Me"" who has shown he fits well in the Happy Endings style and he has great chemistry with Penny/Annie.  If five characters isn't enough we can bring over some of the other Marry Me characters.  Max and Gill can have a ""who's the lazier slob"" contest.  Rick can bring in Denna as an ex-girlfriend; Penny is surprisingly not threatened at all, but Jane hates her because she wants to be the only tall skinny blonde in the group.  Kay can show up and put Brad and Max to shame by being a better black friend AND a better gay friend.  The sky's the limit.This all hinges on ""Marry Me"" getting canceled, which I hope hope hope doesn't happen, but if that's what it takes to get Happy Endings back, I'm on board.Edit: formatting ",0,0.100000001,1.600000024,0.44527328,0.230162144,0.085497737,0.118168674,0.120898143

398,"I posted this on another Happy Endings forum a few weeks ago (have since updated some stuff before posting it here), and I've been meaning to repost it here on reddit, and now with todays depressing news, it seems like a good time to put it up....For anyone missing the Happy Endings cast, heres all the upcoming stuff to look for them in soon that I've been able to find:Upcoming TV stuff: Zachary Knighton just appeared as Elijah Wood's mailman on the new season of Wilfred, not sure if this is a recurring role of just a one time spot. He also mentioned on twitter a while back he's in the upcoming season of ""Always Sunny in Philadelphia"", possibly playing the same character he played on there several seasons ago? I'm not sure. Would be funny if he was returning as that character to get some revenge on the gang, in the similar way Chase did on Max -- too bad we were robbed of another season, I wanted them to continue the Max/Chase thing, darnit! Adam Pally and Casey Wilson will be guest stars on the new season of ""Comedy Bang Bang"" on IFC starting in July. Casey's the main guest for the September 13 episode titled ""Casey Wilson Wears A White Lace Dress & A Black Blazer"" and Adam will be involved in some kind of skit with Chelsea Peretti and Doug Benson, they posted the pic on the Comedy Bang Bang facebook page a while back, it looked like he was playing a UPS delivery guy. Casey will also be appearing in some sketches on the Comedy Central show ""Drunk History"", premiering on July 9th. Heres a pic of her filming a sketch [as Dolly Parton](http://i.imgur.com/lUcbXCL.png). I posted this last week, but another reminder that Adam and Casey are gonna be the two panel comedians paired together for ""The Jeselnik Offensive"" episode that airs on July 23 on Comedy Central. Thats gotta be the one I'm looking most forward to, I hope we keep getting to see the cast keep doing some stuff together in the future. I definitely think Casey and Adam will keep working together in stuff anyway, since they were already good friends before Happy Endings. In a perfect world they'd end up on another show together and Damon/Eliza would end up on another show together, they were my 2 favorite pairings on the show, it's a shame to waste the perfect chemistry those 4 had. I posted about this the other day, but Casey is co-starring in Paul Scheer's new Adult Swim pilot called ""Filthy Sexy Teen$"", which is a spin-off to Scheer's other funny Adult Swim show ""NTSF:SD:SUV"", I now kinda remember that ""Filthy Sexy Teen$"" was a fake tv commercial they ran during some of the credits on ""NTSF"" last season. Much the same way ""NTSF"" originally started as a fake tv commercial during the first season of Childrens Hospital. Of course it's been rumored that Damon will go back to New Girl now, possibly for at least a couple episodes. I haven't been able find any upcoming projects for Elisha yet, but with the announcement of FOX doing a 24 reboot, I assume she's likely to make some appearances in that. I think she surprised everyone on Happy Endings with how funny she was as Alex, lets hope this isn't the last we see of her doing comedic stuff. Don't think anyone ever would've guessed Elisha Cuthbert would be so good at comedy all these years!Upcoming movies: I'm sure most here have heard about this by now, but Damon's filming a movie he's starring in with Jake Johnson (Nick from New Girl) called ""Lets Be Cops"", lets hope it turns out to be good. Adam is also currently filming his first lead role in a movie called ""Search Party"" that he stars in with TJ Miller (The Goodwin Games, played Shershow in Happy Endings season one) and Thomas Middleditch (UCB comedian) and also features Alison Brie from Community and Krysten Ritter from Dont Trust the B in Apt 23. Casey recently made a movie ""Ass Backwards"", that her and June Diane Raphael (NTSF:SD:SUV, Burning Love, Sadie the lesbian gynecologist on New Girl) wrote and star in together. It was at Sundance earlier this year and is supposed to be a female take on ""Dumb and Dumber"" type buddy comedies. It will have it's LA premiere at the [2013 Outfest](http://www.outfest.org/tixSYS/2013/xslguide/eventnote.php?EventNumber=3785&notepg=) in July and is coming out with a wider release later this year. Another Sundance movie Casey co-stars in called ""C.O.G."" (written by David Sedaris) will also be at Outfest and will have a wider release on Sept 20. Casey plays a rare dramatic role in this one. Zachary has a new movie hes in called ""Teddy Bears"" that premiered at a film festival Seattle earlier this month, its some kind of dark comedy that also stars Gillian Jacobs and David Krumholtz. I was watching a video interview with him where he mentioned he's shooting a movie in Austin Texas this summer, haven't been able to find what the movie is yet. Eliza recently co-starred as the love interest in an indie movie called ""Shanghai Calling"" that was on VOD earlier this year, I remember her talking about it in an interview and saying she had to learn Chinese for the movie. They just announced it'll be on DVD on September 17.--I'll update in the replies of this thread if I find anything new, others can feel free to add to it if they hear about any new projects or appearances. It's sad we won't see them get to keep making the show but With the talent of this cast I have no doubt that they'll all find lots of work in their post-HappyEndings careers. After how good they all were on Happy Endings, I would think they'll all be in high demand when networks are casting for new sitcoms, especially come pilot season.",0,0,1.100000024,0.081943288,0.341714859,0.191452354,0.278218746,0.106670722

413,"Dear Executives of ABC, TBS, and now USA Network,As a fan of good TV, I love the witty, critically acclaimed comedy Happy Endings. So do many others, I am sure of it. Recent distressing news of the cancellation of its programming buddy, Dont Trust the B in Apt. 23 has us fans very worried that Happy Endings wont make it to a well-deserved fourth season. I understand that ratings are almost everything to keep a show running, but Happy Endings seemed to perform better with lead-in viewers during its first and second seasons immediately following the smash hit, award winning comedy Modern Family on Wednesday nights at 9:30pm airtime.Mr. Paul Lee, President of ABC Entertainment Group, said the following during a January TCA press tour, We just wanted to say to our audiences that they have more chances to see this. We love this show,"" he said, noting that he recognizes Endings has to stand on its own and that he is confident the series can.If the President of ABC Entertainment recognizes that the series is strong enough to stand on its own, why not renew it for a fourth season? Could you consider it a move to another programming block, perhaps back to Comedy Wednesdays? Any slot in that block would be very good for this comedy. The current confusing scheduling of two episodes a week is also a marker that the show is on the bubble of cancellation. Alex Kerkovich is already crying reading this letter, don't make it worse for her!If the programming space on ABC is an issue, consider the successful (if bold) moving of Cougar Town from the ABC network to TBS network, where, since its move, has performed incredibly well, boasting 2.2 million viewers for its fourth season premiere episode in January. Im sure Cougar Town fans appreciated the move, and will continue to watch faithfully.Recent news of USA Network's interest in picking up Happy Endings if ABC ultimately cancels it led me to add USA Network executives to my efforts. USA Network is responsible for awesome original programming including Psych, Burn Notice, Royal Pains, Covert Affairs, Political Animals, and Necessary Roughness. Happy Endings would fit well among these fan favorites.As fans, we enjoy the witty jokes and gags on this amazing show. The cast is top-notch and blend well together on our TV screens. The writing team is incredible, and, if evidenced by the Funny Or Die video of the writers room, are very tolerant of new ideas. Give the gang another chance, or suffer the wrath of Mark Blumno wait. Why cant I remember my own name?Critical edit on 5/14: Happy Endings has been officially cancelled by ABC after a complete mess of a season scheduling (was Hip Hop Santa on scheduling detail?) despite self-referential network hashtag #SaveHappyEndings in mid-March. Mr. Lee has lied to the ABC demographic and fans about what he wants for the show. He wanted it to die all along. For shame!! I, an avid Castle and Modern Family fan will NEVER watch another show on ABC again. I hope others will join me, for killing Happy Endings, Better off Ted, AND Pushing Daises (a critically lauded trifecta) is all too much to bear.Thank you for your time!TLDR FUCK Paul Lee for crushing my hopes. The petition letter is something execs almost never see due to how Change.org does biz.

I feel like the studio and the channel will get our ardent message if we inundate their Twitter. This is something I feel like I can personally do since I am always on Twitter anyways and I know this is something that others can do as well. Any time Happy Endings come across your mind, send a tweet to ABC.This is a business after all. Television shows do need to pull in big ratings to make big money. However, ABC needs to know exactly how strongly we feel about this show. I don't know about you guys but that hour during Friday evening, I really really really give a shit about the show and it has my attention through the hour. And after the original airing, I will find the episodes and then watch them over and over and over and over again until the laughter I get is only partially painful rather than full-on painful. This devotion is conducive to a network's business. ABC needs to realize that.So let us tweet at ABC, Facebook ABC, write long, passionate fan letters, or even stalk the decision-makers. Whatever you can do, do it. SAVE HAPPY ENDINGS!",0,0.300000012,3.5,0.215576574,0.2087529,0.443757355,0.102236658,0.029676475

435,"Last night, Change.org informed me that my little petition that could hit a staggering 400 signatures in just about 2 weeks of being ""live"" on that site. This is probably due to my rather aggressive side project of promoting it round the Internets these past few weeks. Thanks to you, and people I've hooked on the show, fans, etc. from around the web and world, we've hit this milestone. Change.org suggested I contact a local TV news station (probably ABC 8 here in CT) to do a blurb. That's not out of the question. Still promoting it, and will be mailing a few printed copies with signatures to Paul Lee (President, ABC Entertainment) and 2 addresses of Samie Kim Falvey, Executive VP of Comedy Development at ABC at the very least. Now that we're just a hundred signers short of the lax 500 signature goal, things are looking better. We'll probably get an ""official"" update on the show's uncertain future after the March 29th ""new time"" premiere, and maybe Mr. Lee and co will listen to the growing chorus of fans from around the globe. Not stopping me from still making a YT video, SoundCloud shenanigans, and the like. This is my side project, one I feel deeply for, and I don't want Happy Endings to end up like two recent ABC productions: Better Off Ted and Pushing Daisies, both highly acclaimed by TV critics but under-performing with viewers, hence the ""Brilliant...but cancelled!"" categorization.

The show will be pulled off the schedule in March, with only 15-17 of the ordered episodes for the season to air (don't worry -- all 22 will be produced, so there's that).I don't see many avenues for the show to continue on ABC. We're not getting a new timeslot and we're getting an untested lead-in (a cooking show).There are a few reasons why Happy Endings is the perfect show to take to cable: it has a loyal cult following, the quality is incredible, and it has 50 episodes in the can. So, I propose a three step process towards spreading the word and helping convincing another net to take the show:1) Evangelize the hell out of the show. Tell everyone. Post it on facebook. Post on twitter. Link to the episodes on Hulu. Use social media to spread the word. Even if we can, ever marginally, get the ratings and uptick, we can help show cable nets that there is an audience here that is ready for more ahmahzing times.2) Bug the shit out of TBS and ABC that you loooove this show. Write on their facebook walls: (https://www.facebook.com/TBSveryfunny?fref=ts, https://www.facebook.com/ABCNetwork). Tweet at them: (https://twitter.com/tbsveryfunny, https://twitter.com/ABCNetwork) Email them: (http://abc.go.com/site/contact-us, support@tbs.com). If you guys can think of anything that Fringe or Community did, that would also help. Maybe something super cheap that's very Happy Endings that we can send them.3) Buy the DVDs!

For example when she had a crush on Max, or in ""The Butterfly Effect Effect"" where she is there physically, but is struggling to keep up with the conversations that are going on and therefore is making unfitting remarks which seem rather stupid and nonsensical. Like she is in a whole different world sometimes. So I just assumed that she had trouble with handling the loss of her relationship with Dave, or rather not being able to be as close to him as she was before, while also seeing him with other women. I'm not too sure about this, but I think that she was not in any kind of relationship after she left Dave at the altar.
