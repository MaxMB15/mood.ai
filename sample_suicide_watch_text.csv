5nii2l,"I'm suicidal, but not *suicidal.*

Know what I mean?

In other words, I'm not ""suicidal""-suicidal.

Know what I mean?

That's not to say I'm doing it for attention, though, either. (That's a common assumption/misconception). My pain is very real. My feelings of wanting to die are pretty genuine.

Basically:

**I was just wondering if there was anyone else out there who, like me, has decided *not* to kill oneself—essentially, to continue living—despite the persistence of suicidal thoughts/feelings/ideations/wishes.**

I will not kill myself.

But some days, I really don't want to be alive anymore.",1
6e5wfi,"I don't know if I could ever bring myself to do it. There has been attempts before in the past, but never too serious to the point where I needed to be hospitalized. Once saw a post that said, ""Can I have a 30 day free trial of being dead?"" Never related to something so much in my damn life. Let me be an accident, not to the point where I die, but maybe in a coma for a while. Just to escape. 

I'm the friend that no ones wants to hang out with. I don't have anybody. I made a bad reputation for myself in high school and college (mainly just rumor-based) and I never bounced back from it because of my anxiety. I don't know who I am. I don't know what love is. Being suicidal is the only feeling I truly and wholeheartedly know, which is both comforting and petrifying at the same time. 

Lord forgive me, I'm going to need it. ",1

1pgwuc,"I have been clinically depressed for 8 months. It has affected everything: my relationships, my sport, my family, everything. So I decided to kill myself.

I planned it out meticulously - I was going to commit suicide on a train track. It took me two months to prep it. I calculated where the train would be fastest on the way to the station, the time where it will arrive, even the patters of the transport police. It was perfect.

I got up at 3 o'clock in the morning and went to a small train station about 4 miles from the main city station so I can sneak on the track. I walked about 3 miles down the line to the location. I sat on the line with my back to where the train would approach, headphones in so I wouldn't know it will be approaching.

It approached half 4. Any minute now it should come. 

10mins. Nothing come. Then another 10. 20 mins. 40 mins.

An hour passed and nothing came.

I was fuming. I walked off the track and phoned the train line. 'There isn't any trains running. Maintenance on the line. I'm terribly sorry sir'.

I shouted down the phone at the advisor and hung up. I went to a McD. Completely empty. I ordered some food. I was about halfway through my big Mac when I started giggling to myself. Then I laughed. Hysterically. I had coke coming through my nostrils. 

Two months of planning, preparation and observation and my train was late. And I found that fucking hilarious.

I was so glad that my train was late. I feel like I've been given a second chance at everything. I'm going to grab it with both hands this time.",1
6zzsep,"There's nothing in my life worth living for anymore. Everything and everyone who brought any join into my life is gone. I'm disabled, in poor health, I suffer abuse on a daily basis and I feel totally alone in this world. It would be a relief to be able to just stop existing. The only thing preventing me is the fact that I have 1 or 2 family members who I feel would be deeply affected if I were to check out on them. So I suffer through each day more alone then the last in order to spare their feelings. Anyone else in a similar situation?",1

The fucked up part is that I'm just sitting frustrated about why it didn't go off. I saw my therapist last Saturday and told him about it. He asked if I was willing to bring the gun to him for safe keeping. I complied. Later that day I checked myself into an urgent psychiatric center and they almost kept me. They prescribed Zyprexa instead and after telling my story, the psychologist started crying. That didn't help. The Zyprexa has made me feel numb. I'm not sad, and I'm not happy. I don't want to be alive anymore, or rather, I simply wished I didn't exist. Just needed to get that out. To anyone that reads this, thank you.",1

5yyhn4,"When I last [posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/5mmg7z/i_set_a_deadline/), life seemed completely miserable with no possibility of it getting any better. I continued living day to day, mostly miserable and feeling absolutely lifeless inside. I continued my daily activities with that fake smile so no one would suspect my plan to jump off that bridge with a rope around my neck. Then an unanticipated trip abroad to an exotic land halfway around the world popped up. Then came an out of the blue reconnecting with an old friend. Then came a tiny puppy into my life.

217jxj,"We realise that most of the people who put up posts and comments of this nature want to help, and, if they haven't read the guidelines, it probably hasn't occurred to them that this might not be the right thing to do. But a) it's likely to backfire and b) there's no excuse for not reading the rules!

Responding to a suicidal person with messages like this (excerpted from a recent responder who we'll keep anonymous because they probably meant well):

>  You are not a failure. You are smart, you are young, you have an entire life to live. It is not impossible to become that person you want to be. You can be great.

is incredibly invalidating. If the person you're talking to were capable of believing that, they probably wouldn't be at serious risk for suicide.  And inflicting anything on them along the lines of ""you can do anything you want"" or ""life is worth living"", just disrespects their feelings and increases their sense of personal failure, because they can't do what you told them to do, believe what you told them to believe, or feel what you told them to feel.  As feeling like a failure and/or a burden is one of three most critical risk factors for death by suicide, it is not hyperbole to say that ***these so-called ""empowering"" messages kill people***.  

Guideline 4c links to [a previous PSA post](http://redd.it/1cep2h) that covers in more depth the reasons why this sort of ""cheering-up"" is absolutely against the rules here.  If you have any questions, please [shoot us a modmail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23SuicideWatch).

There's lots of stuff in the sidebar, especially [the talking tips](http://redd.it/igh87) that we've put together to help you be more effective, and avoid dangerous intervention strategies.

**Edit:**  One other very dangerous type of message is ""It gets better"".  Because of the prominence of The Trevor Project and other similar initiatives, a lot of people seem to be coming to us with the idea that ""It gets better"" is not just an okay thing, but the *best* thing, to say to any suicidal person.  Nothing could be more wrong.  ""It gets better"" comes out of an initiative to reach LGBT youth who are being bullied and harassed in school.  And the getting better refers strictly to those behaviours, which *do* get better, on their own, with time, as people's peer groups get older.  It's a message intended to keep these kids from getting to the point where they're at risk for suicide.  But as a ""hopeful"" message for someone at risk, it's worse than useless.  First, it makes promises on behalf of the Universe - and the Universe may not keep them.  Second, it offers no understanding, but devalues or even trivializes their agony.  ",1

7cu84z,"For most of my life, I have found tremendous comfort in knowing that suicide was a dependable way out when everything was just too much.  Like a safety net... but the opposite.  In my mind I would play out different scenarios -- some quick and practical, others more extravagant and poetic.  I would always get that same feeling of freedom that people do when they imagine winning the lotto.  It was a huge help.

Recently, I have been supporting my wife through a very difficult period of grieving, and tonight I realized that if I was to end my life, it would completely break her.  So now, with great sadness, I have had to say goodbye to my reliable friend and protector.  The future seems so much harder now.  Thanks for listening.",1
6263bs,"i've had depression since i could remember. my best (and likely to be only) friend knows about this, and has been a fucking lifesaver. not in like a ""talked me out of killing myself"" way - he doesn't even know i'm suicidal - but in an understated way that he knows i'll respond well to when i'm feeling shitty, which has been happening more and more lately.

my main coping mechanism for my depression/anxiety/suicidal thoughts/basically all the chemical imbalances in my brain is through a gallows sense of humour, which is something we share. nothing's off-limits for the both of us, and we'd definitely get judged if i shared all the shit we joke about on here, so let's just say we can get pretty dark.

recently, i've gone through a lot of shit. a friend blocked me as a result of my shitty, self-destructive behaviour, and several more followed as a result. i don't have many friends as is, so this really took a toll on me, which of course led to an increase in my joking about suicide, because that's kind of how coping mechanisms work.

my friend doesn't laugh any less than he usually does at these new jokes, and he doesn't seem scared or put off by them - but at the same time, i've noticed a change in the way he says ""goodbye"" to me when we go our separate ways after hanging out or after school.

instead of a regular ol' ""bye"", ""later"", ""peace"", or ""deuces"", he'll say ""you better be at school tomorrow"". he's been doing this everyday for a week now, so i guess he's put two and two together.

i dont think i will be alive much longer, a month away seems very far. my last week has been very up and down and isolated and i dont want to be around anyone

the one thing that calms me is when i think to myself and decide that i will kill myself, it is strange because then things are very temporarily a little easier to handle.

i had written up a very long explanation of my life before but it somehow got lost.

the only reason i havent yet is guilt of how it will make my parents feel and sister feel. i could see one or more of them killing themselves after or at minimum the rest of their lives being horrible. this world has hurt me so much and my family and they dont deserve to be hurt even more.

i wont be letting anyone know. part of what hurt me in the past were medications doctors experimented on me. everything made things worse and they didnt listen to me; none of them interacted with me how expected.

so i wont be telling anyone, they will end me up in a hospital and force me on medication (at least that is my fear and that is worse than being dead and i will explain that to my family as to why i didnt tell anyone)

and please respect my wishes and not say anything about medications and how it takes time to find one that works for you, etc..  i am very sensitive and medications are too strong for me. the only thing that helps are therapies i cant afford, i cant afford rent either. i dont want to explain why it is difficult for me to get work. i am very high functioning mentally however that makes more basic tasks more stressing for me or boring

there is no real support either, not unless you pay them which isnt real support imho either. i was seeing a therapist, stopped two weeks ago",1

I won. I fucking won. I learned to not hate people anymore (Go ahead and read the other posts if you please). I learned to enjoy life again. I'm smiling as I write this post. I've started helping people as much as I could, and being my gamer self I've sent steam gifts to people who can't afford their own hobby (better gaming than drugs or something, right?).

30h744,"This is probably not the right subreddit, but whatever. I just needed to say this.

It was 4 AM. 

I was cold. I was lonely. I was tired. I was intoxicated. I was depressed. I was just about ready to finally put a bullet through the roof of my mouth.

But I hadn't eaten in three days, and I sure as hell wasn't dying on an empty stomach.

I stepped outside and lit a cigarette. It was going to be the last cigarette I would ever smoke.

I walked to my local McDonald's. It was the only place still open. It was completely empty. There was one employee left, manning the cash register.

I placed my order and pulled out my debit card.

""Sorry, the system's down, we're cash only for about 10 more minutes.""

I nodded and took a seat in a nearby booth. I could wait for 10 minutes.

I listened to the song on the radio. ""Just a couple more minutes,"" he said.

Another song went by. Then another, then another, then another, and another... 

He walked out, bag in hand, and handed it over to me. ""Don't worry about it,"" he said.

Confused, I walked to the cash register, debit card at the ready. ""So is it ready yet?""

""Don't worry about it.""

I was shocked. ""Thank you, sir.""

I walked out, returned home, and had the best, free, 5 dollar meal I've ever had in my entire life.

I won't kill myself tonight. Maybe I won't, ever. 

Thanks man.

1pdmai,"9 days ago on Saturday, I decided to kill myself. Wanting to kill myself finally overpowered the knowledge of how much pain I would cause to my family and friends. I just woke up that morning and realised I could not take another fucking day. I was going to wait till my parents were asleep, than I was going to swallow an entire bottle of sleeping pills washed down with half a bottle of whisky. Funny thing was the knowledge that I was finally going to do it made it the best day in a while. 

I didn't do anything special. Same old shit. I even finished off a school assignment for some reason. I don't know why. Played Xbox. Went to gym. Went for a run. Talked to a few people on skype. Walked my dog. Had dinner. Dinner was weird, thinking it was my last meal. Said goodbye to my dog, told her I hoped other people would walk her when I was gone. Said goodnight to my parents for what I thought would be the last time. Hugged my grandma goodnight. Went to my room and locked the door. Decided to smoke some weed one last time. By then it was about 10:30 and I knew my parents were going to sleep at about 11:30 so I had some time to kill. Said I’ll give myself an hour to find a reason to not kill myself. Went to this subreddit. Read through all the top submissions and realised I had never tried to fight this. I had only accepted it as inevitable just a question of when. It helped that I was high as fuck but my inner monologue told me I was weak for choosing the easy way out and not giving fighting my depression a serious effort. Took 3 sleeping pills (my usual dose) and passed out. 

The next day was shit. Still as depressed as ever, still wanted to kill myself. But I legitimately tried to get better. And by the end of the day I had smiled without faking it for the first time in months. I felt happy for a little bit. And I realised that I would go months of being depressed in the hope of feeling like that again. It was just a simple thing, my dog licking me on the nose while I was listening to some music. In the days that followed things haven't improve much but I haven’t legitimately considered suicide since.  I’m determined to beat this one way or another. I’m debating not smoking weed for a few months and see if that helps or not. But whatever happens, you guys saved me from killing myself that night.


Much love.

6crayh,"I am being harassed and the legal system is set up to protect the people harassing me more than me. I keep begging the police for help and  they seem sympathetic but tell me that they can't do anything since I am not being threatened. I just lost one of my jobs over this and have no idea what I am going to do. There is no justice in the justice system.

I am going broke from legal fees, bills, and unexpected expenses. The job I lost was only part-time but that $400 a month matters. My ex destroyed my credit so I can't even rely on that. My electric is going to get shut off because the equal pay plan ended and I don't have the money to pay the rest of the bill.

I have a vet bill that needs to be paid because my cumstain of an ex never paid it and I moved so I didn't get the bill. My cat is epileptic and takes medication. She has to get bloodwork every year and I don't know how I am going to afford both the old bill and the new one. I'm so fucking useless that I can't even properly take care of my cat.

I have a new boyfriend but I'm having trouble enjoying it. He reached out to play with my hair yesterday and I flinched so obviously that he pulled back. He told me it's okay, he understands, and even apologized to me for scaring me. *He* apologized to *me* like he did something wrong. I'm the one that's so broken that I pull away from kindness. He deserves so much better than what I can offer.

I am exhausted to the bone. I'm averaging 3 hours of sleep a night and it's interrupted by nightmares. Every noise sends me into a panic and I feel too vulnerable to sleep with headphones on.

My anxiety is so high that it has  reached the stratosphere. I can't leave my apartment alone without feeling like the ground is going to give way. I can only go out when I am with someone and I just feel so goddamn pathetic asking people to come with me to the store.

##Edit:  June 11, 2012:  We're getting reports of reddit user loosepanda22 sending PMs inviting people to his pro-suicide subreddit.  Please report any occurrences to us using the link at right.  Thanks!##

If you get a PM that looks ""official"", encourages you to avoid suicide hotlines, and links to ""painless"" suicide methods, please use the link at right or **[click here to message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FSuicideWatch)**.  Please **include the reddit account** that the PM came from.  

This person is trying to undermine our mission by **randomly and indiscriminately** targeting our OPs with PMs that appear to come from us at SW,  sound compassionate, and seem factual on the surface.  Their true goal is to make suicide seem safe and painless, and make seeking help seem difficult and dangerous.  
*****
**If you get one of these PMs, remember that the troll has no interest in helping you.       
He's** ***using you*** **to target /r/SuicideWatch.**
*****

Despite what the PMs claim, please be assured of the following:

* The SW moderators truly cannot trace the source of any post.  We more than anyone else desperately wish we could sometimes.   The troll claims that this has happened in the past, but in all cases the OPs were either located by the resourceful use of standard internet search methods, or were traced by someone other than the SW moderators.

* Calls to suicide hotlines do not regularly result in involuntary psych holds and expensive ambulance bills.   It's possible, but it's rare and is  unlikely unless you are uncooperative with the hotline responders.  The troll claims that a simple admission of suicidal feelings is enough to trigger police intervention and involuntary confinement.  This is completely false.   A rescue will only be initiated when the caller is at *immediate* risk for suicide, and is either unable or unwilling to agree to a safety plan.   Suicide hotlines are the best help that's out there, and they understand that anonymity helps callers feel safe to speak openly.  They only betray confidentiality as an absolute last resort.  

* In almost all jurisdictions, the doctrine of *informed consent* applies to suicide hotline callers.  That means that callers have a right to know the hotline's policy regarding confidentiality, and their criteria for breaking confidentiality.    Callers are entitled to know this information before they disclose anything.  However, the onus is on the caller to ask the question.  If you're concerned about confidentiality when calling a hotline, you are entitled to ask them what their disclosure policy is before you tell them anything about yourself or answer any questions.  (And it's always best to ask as politely as you can, understanding that you're probably feeling pretty rotten or you wouldn't be calling.)

* The PM claims that you can help your loved ones avoid suffering by killing yourself by one of the ""painless"" methods.   This is an extremely dirty trick of psychological manipulation, as one of the highest risk factors for suicide is a sense of being a burden.  Please be assured that according to the [actual experts](http://books.google.com/books?id=RSt4hnnKoWkC), the only thing a person struggling with suicidal thoughts can do to significantly reduce their loved ones' suffering is to get some real help.

*  The troll is also subverting the mission and intent of Exit International.  Their Peaceful Pill handbook, which the PM links to, explicitly states that **anyone struggling with depression should not be exposed to this material**.  

It's very important that you report any PMs of this nature.  Please also report and downvote any comments which claim responsibility for the PMs, or defend the troll's actions.  ",1

I am so lost I don’t even know how to explain it.     
   
When I lost the only guy I had ever loved some six years ago, it really ripped my soul out. I never recovered from that. All the ambition, the positive thinking, the effort and the goals in my life just vanished.     
I kept on going through the motions for a while, but by the third year it was really just the bare minimum. Just enough to stay afloat. For a while I could live off that.     
But then the whole economic collapse failed and my industry caved in on itself, and the bare minimum became a struggle.     
It’s not that I couldn’t do more – I was, and am, capable. It’s just not in me. I have such a hard time getting out of bed in the morning. I fear waking up, and cry every morning when I do.    
I am not pining for some guy anymore. I don’t even have the motivation to do that – it’s like I’m completely empty. I just don’t feel anything except this big heavy stone. It’s like everything that I was full of drained out of me, and there’s nothing left.    
I have, technically, a boyfriend. But he’s worthless – there’s nothing between us but a history and a facebook label. When I try to tell him how hopeless I feel… if I dare use the word “depressed,” then there’s hell to pay. A locker-room pep talk that starts with “you’re a worthless piece of shit! Do you wanna be a worthless piece of shit forever? Fight!” and ends with him muttering to himself and storming around the house. Eventually he calms down and apologises but then it’s just more lecture for a couple more hours until he runs out of steam. Nothing ever changes. Nothing gets better.     
And everything just keeps getting worse.    
    
Now, I can’t make this month’s rent.     
    
I was standing on the train platform last night for more than an hour, dreading going back home. Not because of a boyfriend I am so indifferent to that I can’t bother to dump him, not because of a rent that’s only a few hundred dollars low, not because of a dying industry that I might as well just change… but because of the thought that even if I do go home, even if I do go to sleep and wake up in the morning, it will be just as bad as it was yesterday, and will only get worse.    
    
I have been contemplating suicide for more than three years, but last night was the worst for a long time. I have researched it thoroughly, but can’t find a feasible, painless, quick solution. The pain terrifies me – the knowledge that a head lives for four minutes after decapitation. Guns aren’t available in this country. I have heard what aspirin overdoses do to the blood and how a person suffers before death. Perhaps the best option I have come up with yet is tubing the exhaust through the window of my car and letting it run…. I heard you just go to sleep.    
    
But I know that I didn’t jump on the tracks last night, and I haven’t taped up my car windows just yet, and for some reason I am here typing this long, long note out. So something in me – soul or no soul - doesn’t want to give up just yet. I don’t know what to do.     
    
...I think that when I wake up tomorrow morning, if I don't feel any better, I will just go ahead and jump. The station is only a five minute walk through the park. It only gets worse from here, anyways.
        
       
       
**edit:** When I woke up this morning, the first thing I did was to look on this page to see if anyone had written any advice. And I burst into tears. Seriously. I have never felt so protected, so warm, and so safe in any community as I do here. I found people to talk to, people who understand, people who sympathize, people who listen, people who have reached out a helping hand and given me a hug more sincere than any I have felt in years. There are no words of thank you that can encompass the gratitude and relief I feel. It's like in the darkness a rope has been thrown down to pull me out.      
      
Since I'm not really sure what to think and how to react, it has helped so much to read your messages. I will prepare something, some kind of *ongaeshi*, I will post it up soon!     
     
Once again.....

6qrkkd,its midnight and im sitting outside. I took a 3hour long shower and I still feel disgusting. I dont know this person. I was out jogging and he jumped me. Literally almost ripped my lip off. forced himself on me. im a 17 year old guy. I just need someone to call. i dont know what to do I feel awful.,1
1zrrrw,"I am 26 years old right now, and not a day goes by where I don't think about my older brother. People used to ask me when I was a kid if I had any siblings and I would always point to my older brother and say ""He's my brother"". 

Now I just say I'm an only child and leave it at that. Half of my friends don't know I had a brother, because I don't want to mention it. 

Well, here goes the story that I never told anyone before. Me and my older brother were like two peas in a pod. We used to do everything together. Play sports, watch movies, and like other brothers, we used to fight. But with every fight, we always had the gift of being able to make up with each other and still be brothers that love each other. 

I used to say rude things to him, I used to call him a jerk and a mean person, but I never really meant it. 
So my brother was 18 years old when he was dead. I remember he was unusually quiet the days before his suicide, and he was complaining about something to dad, that I never really know what until I later realized it was about anxiety. 

He taught me how to make something called paper airplanes, where you got paper and made them into airplanes. It was fun, I used to get paper airplanes and throw them to his room and see how far It would land, and then he would get some paper and shoot it back at my room every morning. 

Every other morning he would shoot a paper airplane at my room when I was just waking up. Sorta of our way of saying good morning to each other.

So one day, I woke up. I looked around and there was no paper airplane in my room. I guess I slept longer than him, but I never do. He usually wakes up at like 7 am in the morning. I checked the time and it was 11 am. 
I made a paper airplane and threw it at his room. 
He would usually show himself and play tackle me or tickle me when I did but no one came out the room. I opened the door fully and he wasn't in his bed. 

That's when I looked around and saw the paper he used to make paper airplanes out of, it was all neat and nothing was really ripped apart or touched like it usually was. 

I saw the closet was mildly open and that's when I saw the same image that sticks with me to this very day. I saw my brother in the closet with his eyes mildly open mildly closed, and his face with a pale expression, almost like a frown. I remember his skin color looked odd. I thought he was just standing at first but he was a bit taller. I saw something was holding him up and then I saw the little rope by his throat holding him up. I didn't know what he was doing, I thought it was a prank he made to scare me. I touched his chest and then pushed him. I then started yelling and pushing him violently and then screamed for my mom and dad. By then tears were on my eyes.

But I can tell you right now, if I had to choose something that tore me apart more... My brother's lifeless body or my parents reaction to it, I would have chose parents reaction. 

My dad came into the room, followed by my mom, and for some reason I just didn't want to be in that room anymore and I let myself out to the hallway. Then I heard screaming of my brother's name from my mom, and then some type of noise. I think it was my dad pushing my brother's body, like me. They started sobbing. I went to peek back in the room and then I saw my dad shaking and whimpering. He was a tough guy he never cried in any sad movies me, my brother, and him used to watch together but he was crying nonstop. My mom was just standing there with her lips quivering... her teeth shaking, and her eyes were red. I didn't notice it but I was crying too. My whole body was shaking. 

I ripped up all my paper in my room and I felt like throwing up and spitting out my insides, I then just sat down in my bed for seemingly hours. I never wanted to leave the room, and all I could think about was if this was some sort of nightmare that I was in. I tried going like the cartoons and pinched myself, I used my nails to cut myself deep in my skin to wake me up, I scratched harder till there were marks on my arms but I never woke up. I never woke up.

Every night now, I always wonder what my brother would be like when he was around my age now, and if he would have had a family by now. 

Every year on the day of my brother's death, I throw a paper airplane to a river, and every day I would hope to wake up in my room with a paper airplane lying in my bed, from my older brother. That's the story of my brother's suicide. ",1
ilm67,"Im from a third world country, and my entire family is very religious, I'm not. 

While I respect their choice to belive in something, they dont respect mine. They think that depression is a joke, that it's just an excuse for ""lazy"" people. I tried to explain to them how the human body works, but a simple concept like cells and hormones doesnt make sense to them.

Im alone. Im 20, I dont have a job, I dont have friends, and the only joy that I have in this world is to talk with my ""online friends"" and that is starting to fade away. I never met my mother and my father ( the only person that tried to help me get out of this hole ) hanged himself 2 years ago, and now I have to hear things like ""he is going to end like his dad if he doesnt find God"".

4ttne8,"We've had a sudden uptick of anonymous people (or possibly one energetic person) clicking ""report"" and specifying something like ""viable threat of self-harm"" as the report reason.  We have no idea what the motivation is for these reports, but this is a dangerous and ill-advised practice for the following reasons:

1. Reporting a post increases the probability that it will be snagged by the reddit spam filter.  This is entirely outside the moderators' control.

2. The criteria for these reports seem to be pretty random, and [do not correspond to established, evidence-based risk assessment criteria](http://redd.it/1c7nqf).

3.  Most of the reported posts have had some good, supportive responses, so there doesn't appear to be any special action warranted on the part of the moderators.  

4.  What it says in the sidebar is true - we don't have the resources to trace the source of any post, but we fear that this is what our anonymous reporter is expecting.  So we'd like to point out that ""outing"" someone can actually increase the inherent risk in a situation rather than decreasing it, especially in the long term, by discouraging them from opening up about their feelings.  Involuntary interventions are almost never necessary, and almost always traumatic.  It's important to remember that anonymity is a safety device in suicide intervention.  It saves far more lives than it costs.  The times when outing someone is the safer choice are the rare exceptions, as when someone gets entangled in a safety harness and needs to be cut out of it.

ndlxt,"I attempted to kill myself in my college dorm a little over two years ago.

It wasn't much of a suicide attempt as it was a, ""Hey, I'm gonna do this, and if it happens to kill me, whatever."" I was unconscious for over 24 hours. My roommate was the only person who knew at the time. I just told him I got really wasted and was just super tired and sick all day. I had taken three half-full bottles of pills. It was a spur of the moment decision and I had convinced myself that I wasn't doing anything wrong and just wanted to make myself be happy and pass out. Two days later I could barely move, my head was pounding, my heart was pounding, and it was hard to breathe. I may very well have taken a lethal dosage and lived for no good goddamn reason.

I don't remember much of that semester, or really that whole year. So I was surprised to find some Facebook posts just today.

Looking back, I posted every day. Something. Oftentimes a little cry for help, even if it sounded silly. And then, there was a three-day period where I posted nothing. I knew immediately what those three days were. But there was one post on my wall... it was from my sister...

"" Brudder! Are you alive? :) ""

Holy shit.

I read that today and it just ripped me apart to think that when I was about to die, my sister was thinking about me. I chose to wear a blindfold of self-pity and tried to convince myself no one cared. Don't be a fucking idiot like I was. If I had killed myself, I would have killed my sister, and plenty of other people, too.

If you want to be selfish, be selfish enough to get help.

I hope someone reads this and gets something out of it. My sister and the rest of my family still have no idea this ever happened.

**tl;dr - Sister jokingly asked if I was still alive after I almost killed myself.**",1
79ysam,"I wasn't always this way.  But sometime around 2011, I began to notice that I felt certain urges and thoughts when near prepubescent children.  They aren't urges to hurt them or, god forbid, do *that* to them...but I would sometimes imagine them naked and using the toilet.

That sounds really strange, and this requires some backstory on me: since my teens, I've been aroused by images of people going to the bathroom (don't ask why, who the hell knows).  It mostly pertained to people my age...but then I accidentally came across a kid (Google Image, I don't go to any...*sites*, good lord) and found myself equally aroused.  I was horrified.

I know this is really, really gross and sick, I know.  It's happening more and more often, these thoughts.  I had a therapist who knew, but when she moved away, I had no one.  Trust me, it takes months or even *years* to build up that kind of trust for me.  I can't even say the...word...itself because I am so sickened by how I think sometimes.

Believe me: you cannot hate me more than I hate myself.  I nearly attempted suicide twice in college and it was a big part of my rationale for truly attempting suicide in March.  Please, please, just...be kind.  That's all I want.  I've never felt more alone.",1

This has been the scariest day of my life. That child is my entire world. She’s all I have. I have out my heart and soul into raising her. I never want to lose this little girl. 
But here I am. She’s about to be 14. She’s a little on the eccentric side, but she has a heart of gold. She’s never met a stranger. But ever since 8th grade has started, she has been getting bullied. And the teachers don’t really do anything about it. This was her way of coping. 
I went to wake her for school this morning and found her covered in vomit and she had been hallucinating and having seizures for hours probably. What if I hadn’t found her?
Why does she feel like this is the only way? I want to make all the bad go away. How do I do this? How do I help her cope? 
I didn’t know who to turn to, so I’m turning to reddit. Please help me understand how to help her. 

**UPDATE

My daughter is still in recovery but she’s come so far! We are no longer in ICU. We were moved to the special care unit which is a step down. 
She doesn’t remember anything. She doesn’t even remember school that day. She’s so upset that this happened. She said she doesn’t understand why and how she did it. 
She was hallucinating pretty bad over the last couple of days but that has subsided tremendously, if not completely. 
She’s still unable to determine if she’s in reality or if this is a dream.  And it’s heartbreaking to tell her this is reality, but this reality is way better than the one I thought I would have.

She would’ve stopped them. It hurt so much I thought they were going to kill me. Now I wish they had.

You changed a lot after her death. You stopped asking how my day was. You stopped coming to pick me up from school. All my friends they thought that my dad coming to pick me up was lame but I only wanted to see you as soon as school was over. That’s how much I love you.

I always will. Maybe when I’m gone I could look after you from up above like mom was supposed to.

 My best friend was the first to go. She started doing heroin against my warnings. A week after her first time trying it, she got a batch laced with fentanyl and elephant tranquilizers. I remember the last text I got from her... 

Next was someone I reconnected with at her service. I hadn't seen him in years, so we started hanging out and stuff again. He never told me he had a pill problem.. he probably knew I would have stopped talking to him... he overdosed a month after we got close again.

Two days before that, my friend from high school was on his way to work when his power steering went out while he was getting off the freeway. His car flipped and his neck snapped on impact.

But who gives a shit about money. Sure, I made a mistake working two months for no pay with someone else and am now screwed. (Different than above) Sure, the person I trusted most as a friend I just found out has been ripping me behind my back because she thinks I'm in love with her.

e3nth,"My freshman and sophomore years in college were the worst.  There were several nights when I did consider suicide, which is why I am posting here.  (1984 was a very very bad year -- Orwell had it right for me, at least.)  I am not writing in the sense of giving advice.  First I am not a professional, other than by dent of dealing with depression day after day.  Second, depression differs from person to person.  I have a friend whose depression leads to anxiety -- such that he cannot sit through a movie without feeling pressure to worry about the future.  My issue is the opposite: I go numb: distant from everything; cut off from any sense of shared experience with anyone.  Crushing isolation.  And always the same hammering question: Why bother?  Why bother with any of it?

So why write at all?  Because sometimes just knowing someone has shared experiences can help.  It has helped me a lot.  ANd I fully understand that my coping mechanisms may not work for you.  But they might lead to something that offers a glimmer of light.

For me, realizing several toxic patterns of thought helped me to curtail them.  Each of these eventually leads to ""Why bother"" and the dark conclusions there.  When I start down any of these roads, I do whatever it takes to derail my thinking.  More and that below.

My private list of poisonous things others tell us and even worse things we tell ourselves:

1:  ""I would be happier if only..."" If only what?  I was rich?  I had a girl?  I had close friends?  It doesn't work that way.  I found a great woman and married her.  My depression had a choking answer, one I should have seen coming:  ""Well, I have a great wife, and I am still depressed.  I must really be a loser.""  Grasping for external means to cure depression never has worked for me.  It may not work for you either.  Stop the ""Only if..."" thinking.  It is a never-ending treadmill.

2: ""I need to be happy.""  Not true, especially if you (like me) are introverted.  Introverted people hate being pressured to be happy.  It depresses us.  Great.  What most of us want is inner peace.  Happiness happens on its own; it cannot be captured by sheer will power.  Let the pressure go.  I suspect we have enough to deal with without it.

3: ""The future is hopeless... ""  ""Look at all the mistakes from the past...""  Never play time traveler.  It's another game where the house always wins.  The future is unknown and the past is gone.  Live here and now.  What I am doing right now?  What's happening around me?  Is it raining outside?  Am I hungry?  Do those french fries smell good?  Is that woman cute?  Is that man handsome?  When you start time traveling, put the breaks on the TARDIS.  There is nothing there that your depression can't reach before you open the door.

4:  ""You need to get out!  Go to a bar!  Go dancing!""  Maybe.  Probably not though.  Not if you are introverted.  This well-meaning advice can cut like knives.  Be cautious.

5:  ""You need to get over it.""  I am sitting here loaded to the gills on hydromorphine, fighting off 5 kidney stones and the knowledge that polycystic kidney disease is turning my innards into oatmeal.  Odd how no one ever tells me to get over it.  You do not ""get over"" chronic conditions.  When people say this about depression, my answer is always, ""I'm trying, baby, I'm trying.""  Then I let it go.

What has helped deal with these bad lines of thought:

1:  The one thing all of the thought patterns above have in common is that they are directed inside: they are aimed directly at sufferer.  ""I don't... I can't... I feel... I need to...""  It's being kicked to the curb when you are at your lowest.  Take a deep breath.  Then get out of your skull.  It can be a very dangerous neighborhood when you are alone.  ""I can't.."" No.  ""That cat is pretty.""  ""The wind is really blowing.""  ""What was Thomas Jefferson thinking when argued with John Adams?""  ""What would it take to fix that window?""  Get out of your skull.  You are on the Titanic.  What could you do to save more people than they did?  Would Iron Man defeat Spider Man if they fought?

2:  Do something.  No, don't go rushing to the nearest hot spot, but do something.  Move.  Walk.  Study astronomy.  Take up cooking.  None of this takes a ton of money.  It takes discipline to free yourself from your mind, but I believe in my heart that people have this power.  Better still, these things can change the future we are so often worrying about.  Dreaded questions become (by the smallest of degrees at first) easier to handle:  ""Hey.  Long time no see.  Whatcha up too?""  ""I am learning how to cook.  Not very good at it yet, but finding my way.""  ""Cool.  What are you making these days?""  A conversation.  Such a small thing, easily overlooked.  But small things add up.

3:  Stop trying to capture happiness and instead let it happen.  You don't even have to know it at first.  ""The sun feels good on my back.""  That's all.  No pressure.  No unrealistic expectations of a miracle end to depression.  Small things.  Tiny steps.

I am not going to tell you any of this conquered my depression.  It would be a lie, and it would go against everything I have written above.  There are times when depression still presses in choking tight.  But its grip no longer has the power to kill.  I am not suggesting that joy is around the corner.  I am merely looking out the window.  The first snow of winter is coming down.  It's pretty.  It's okay to live.  One tiny step at a time.",1

Who knows maybe 2017 is the year everything turns around for me. I have a good feeling about this year. 

Sorry if this isn't the right spot for it. I just felt like I needed to share with someone. Since it was the topic of suicide I figured this was the place to post it.

Hang in there everybody.

2g9cmu,"Hello all!

Lately we’ve been noticing a serious increase in the number of people inviting PMs, posting identifying information (this includes usernames on other social media sites) and generally not following the [rule regarding keeping conversations *public* unless the OP asks.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/xgrba/from_the_suicidewatch_mod_team_if_youre_here_to/)

***


So, why are we so adamant about enforcing these rules? What’s the big deal about moving conversations to PM anyway? Well, there are risks on both sides. 

**For the poster/person in distress** – there is no one to point out if you are being given bad or dangerous advice. Having multiple people comment, or even just able to read the conversation can make a big difference. When the conversation stays on the subreddit, we’re able to step in if needed. People with questionable motives are more likely to want to move to PM, since then no one can point out their inappropriate behavior or contradict them. 

**For the people commenting** – When you move to PM there can be an expectation that you will make everything better. That is an *enormous* pressure to put on a single person. Even hotline responders have people with them helping to back them up and keep them level headed. Keeping things out in the open means sharing the responsibility and letting others step in as needed. 

**For everyone** - Posting information regarding other social media accounts (your skype username, telephone number, etc) is ***not allowed*** by our subreddit or by Reddit itself. We will remove all posts that do this. 

‘But skyqween, these risks are okay with me. **Why else would I bother keeping my discussion out in the open?**’ Great question! Having your conversation visible to others isn’t just about risk management (though that is the main reason). The [90/10/1](http://www.nngroup.com/articles/participation-inequality/) rule of the internet says that for every person posting in distress, there are roughly nine more lurking and reading the supportive comments because they aren’t comfortable making a post themselves. So, when you keep your conversation visible to others you’re also *helping others to feel less alone and misunderstood.*

##This is the bottom line:

If you are a poster in distress, we very much hope that you will choose to have a conversation out in the open. However, we recognize that some are not comfortable with this. If you’re not comfortable posting publicly there are alternatives to simply making a post asking for PMs. You are always welcome to message the mods and talk to us privately. Another avenue you might want to explore is choosing someone who has a good track record in the community that you feel comfortable talking to and messaging *them* directly. However, at the end of the day if you are a poster and feel that you must post asking for a private conversation we understand. Please just be aware of the risks going forward. 

##If you are a commenter and want to ask people to pm you despite all this – don’t. We will remove the posts when they are brought to our attention and when we find them.

6v85dg,"The mystery of death scares me, I have tried to kill myself in the past when things were so bad I was completely numb to any fears. 
Now I sometimes wish it would get that bad again so I could get it done once and for all. But there is some good things about life that keep me here, weed, tv shows, movies and video games, that is literally my life, well the only things that keep me going. Basically just distracting myself from how I feel.

I've tried therapy, in patient time, medication, cbt, time, nothing works for me. I am constantly bored with life, I refuse to work doing something I hate just to keep doing something I hate. Very childish mindset I imagine you thinking, but i would literally rather die than become a slave to society. 

I was happy for about a month, when I had a girlfriend, she distracted me and made me happy. That didn't last.

And suddenly, it hit me. Like a sledgehammer right into my face - **I am completely alone in this world.**

Even though it may seem liberating or romantic, it isn't. It's the cold hard truth I'll have to face for every day until I die.

I don't think I'll be able to bear that burden.",1
1cep2h,"We've been seeing an increase in this type of submission at SW lately.  You may not have noticed, because we have removed most of them, but we've missed a couple and received some understandable complaints.

First of all, if you have been helped by seeing one of these messages at a critical time in your life, that is wonderful.  But if that's the case, **it helped you because you believed it**.  Sadly, that's not how it works for many of the most at-risk people struggling with suicidal thoughts.  

This is why, in our [talking tips post](http://redd.it/igh87) we say: 

> Don't disagree with suicidal people about how bad things are.  It’s not about their circumstances; it’s about their suffering, and you can’t measure that from the outside.  **A message that** ***in any way*** **tries to tell or show the suicidal person that “it’s not so bad” is just another way of saying “I don't understand what you’re going through”.**  

For our OPs who are in the lowest and most dangerous state of mind, simply seeing one of these message can make their sense of alienation and failure worse, because they are not remotely able to believe that it's true *for them*.  Anything  meant to be universally ""uplifting"", including the overuse of the ""It Gets Better"" message, which originated in the specific context that adults aren't usually as emotionally immature as teenagers, tends to backfire.

We know that these posts come from people who truly want to help.  Perhaps they think that, if they only have time to write one message, they can do the most good by reaching out in a general way to many people.  That assumption is refuted by all the best experimental and clinical data that we have.  (Please see the references in the [talking tips post](http://redd.it/igh87) if you're interested in the details.)

If you only have time to write one message here, sort by ""New"" and pick an OP who doesn't have many good responses on their thread, and respond to them, directly and personally.  If you don't know what to say, that's what the [talking tips](http://redd.it/igh87) are for!

You will still help many people!  A lot of our most distressed people lurk for a long time before posting, and what we hear from them over and over again is that what finally helped them get up the courage to post was seeing this type of empathetic and *individualized* response.  

Edit: typos, added the origin of ""It Gets Better"".

my mom and dad are extremely religious. 
I attend a Christian boarding school and I've been getting touched and forced to do things I don't want to do by one of the priests. It happens about 2-3 times a week and sometimes more. I can't handle it anymore. I'm just so tired of fighting. I'm a pathetic loser. I'm using the library computer right now and I'm not sure if I'm posting in the right place but I just need to get it out there. He is a monster. He ruined my life. It all started with him simply hugging me too tight, then it was rubbing my thigh in a weird way. And one day he asked me to go to his room so we can go over some preparations for a ceremony we had. I don't remember most of that day I just remember passing out and then waking up with my pants around my ankles and him behind me and feeling this awful pain. He told me that if I tell anyone he'd kill me, and that I'm special. I sat on the roof for hours crying that night. Then I went back to my bunk and tried to sleep. I thought it was the end but it wasn't. It keeps happening and happening and it never ends. I'm losing focus in school, I don't eat anymore. I ignore everyone and no one cares. He makes me go to the dark room with him every few days to ""help"" him and if I don't he gets mad, I tried not going once and I got f*cked with a cross for it. I couldn't walk straight for a week. Last night was one of the worst nights to date. It was awful. He made me realize how much of a worthless piece of filth I am. Which is why I'm writing this. I'm just done. I'm crying and It hurts that this is what it has come to. I wish someone had saved me. But everyone just stands there and watches, it's so obvious that they know what he does. But nothing. Nothing has changed. I get it now. I just don't deserve to be saved, and I get that now. my name is Matthew and Im 16. 
I thought I was gonna be able to add more detail about what I'm going through but I'm struggling with writing this as it is especially from the library. I'm sorry to whoever is reading this, I just had to let it out.

4hdc1i,"A bit about my son- Before he starting dating his now deceased girlfriend, he was extremely depressed. He broke up with his girlfriend who was his best friend before. That absolutely crushed him. He used to be the happiest kid ever! He hung out with friends and was all around just a happy person. After that happened he became very cold and distant. He hated to go out with family and wanted to be alone.  He mistrusted everyone and even mistrusted his mother, my wife. He claimed that she was a liar and was manipulating me to get him in trouble. HE thought of everyone like that. 

 Anyway a few years ago he meet a girl, who I’ll call Emma, and he did a complete 180. He was happy again and became a better person all around. He always told me how much he loved her. I don’t think Ive ever seen two people in love as him and Emma. She was so ingrained in our family that she started to come to family reunions we would have with our cousins every few months. His depression never really went away though. He went through bouts of being extremely sad, but he always found a way to “plateau” himself. Emma, however, has had it much worst. He told me that she was beaten by her father, and how she had to grow up early because when she, her mother and her sister moved out, her mother became an alcoholic and was unable to take care of them.

She and my son moved into an apartment and have been living together for a little while now. About a month ago he called me on the phone and his voice was very shaky. He told me that she tried to kill herself with his own gun. He told me that he took a week off of work to be with her. He also told me that he was going to talk with some therapists. That takes us to 5 days ago. I got a call from him and he was crying a lot. After about 1 minute or so he finally collected his voice and told me that she had killed herself. He told me that and I got in my car and drove 2 hours to where he lived. When I got there, he was cleaning blood out of the carpet. He stood up and there was still blood on his clothes. I gave him a hug and he starting crying. He kept saying things like: “It was my fault” and “I could have stopped her”. He told me that when they woke up that morning, she wanted a snack, so he went out to get her a snack. When he came back, he found her on the floor with her wrists slit. She was barely alive so he ran to he and tried to help her by putting pressure on her wounds. He said that she died in his arms.

At the funeral when her casket was being lowered, he didn't cry at all, he just stared at it. He had this blank expression on his face. After it was lowered and people were shoveling dirt into the hole, he just started walking away. He walked passed his car and was walking toward the entrance of the cemetery. We called out to him but he continued to walk. I caught up to him and I turned him around and told him that I wanted to help him through what he was going through. He looked coldly and said, “I have nothing to say to you”. He looked like he wasn’t there. I could see it in his eyes. It was as if his body was talking, but he wasn’t. Its hard to explain. He turned away and continued to walk. We later found him wandering aimlessly around town.

 I went to visit him today. Since I'm a cosigner of his apartment I have an extra key.  I found him passed out on his desk and bottle of vodka in his hand. In his other hand I noticed that there was something in his hands. I opened it up and what I saw made me cry. There was a box with a wedding ring. He was going to propose to her! How can I help my son with what he’s going through? I don’t know what to do. I feel like Im not doing enough.

28z97u,"We've learned that someone is reaching out to ""help"" some of our OPs via PM, tricking them into clicking links that go to IP tracing sites, and passing the information on to police.  **We cannot overstate how much we deplore this reprehensible and frankly stupid behaviour!**

As a suicide intervention strategy, it's beyond misguided, and likely to cause more suffering and death than it prevents (see below).  Further, it's a violation of both our subreddit rules, and reddit's TOS.  We, with the help of the reddit admin team, are doing all we can behind the scenes to put a stop to this, but the anonymous nature of reddit means that people can sometimes find ways around the counter-measures, so please be forewarned.  

If you're here to **get** help, please familiarize yourself with the subreddit rules, and please report and then ignore any responses or PMs you get that violate them.  Consider whether you actually want help from someone who either doesn't care enough to learn the rules of the community before participating, or who thinks they are above the rules or know better than we do.  The SW mod team, collectively, has about 40 years' experience in suicide intervention and related mental-health and human services fields.  All of our rules exist for excellent reasons!

If you're here to **give** help, please read and follow the rules.  We know that the points in section 4 of the guidelines may seem counter-intuitive - that's why all of them link to mod posts where we discuss the rationale in detail. All of these rules were arrived at in collaboration with, and with the overwhelming support of, the SW community. The rule about keeping interactions out in public is designed to ensure that bad advice gets debugged, and that our helpers don't get overwhelmed or overcommitted and end up letting people down. ***Most of the problems we end up dealing with in modmail are the result of helpers violating the one or more of rules in section 4, whether deliberately or inadvertently.***

I also want to say a bit about the SW mod team's philosophy regarding confidentiality.  We don't believe in ""outing"" anyone who posts here unless there's a credible threat of harm to *others*.  We know that anonymity makes it possible for people who are having really dark thoughts to open up and talk about things without fear of having it come back to haunt them, or without fear of people making assumptions about them based on their personal history.  Anonymity is in itself a safety measure in suicide intervention, and the rare cases where it leads to a bad outcome are not typical - they're like the freak-accident scenarios where someone is strangled by a safety harness or smothered by an airbag.   

There seems to be a widespread perception that calling police and arranging an involuntary intervention is the only/best thing to do when someone expresses any kind suicidal ideation - that's absolutely not true! Suicide hotlines don't do this very often at all. For example, the hotline I work at breaches confidentiality roughly 0.2  percent of the time - that's **once in 500 calls**, even though almost every call involves some degree of suicidal ideation. An involuntary intervention is regarded as a failure - having your privacy violated is incredibly traumatic and it *always* sets people back, so hotlines do everything they can do avoid it.  

Hotlines welcome calls from concerned third parties. If you encounter someone anywhere who you think may be at risk for suicide, we strongly recommend that, unless you have sound reason to believe that a suicide attempt is already in progress, your first call should be to your local or national suicide hotline. They can do an expert risk assessment in real time, and quickly help you identify the best next steps. If *they* suggest calling the police, then of course you should do so, but most of the time they'll offer you a less drastic and more therapeutic way to help the person you're concerned for.

7f67m0,"I'm not really sure how to word this, so I'm just gonna write down some reasons why I'm killing myself. I feel kinda shitty making this since I don't wanna seem like I'm baiting for pity comments, I'm just making this as a last little message sorts thing.. Sounds kinda  stupid, doesn't it? Its not really like anyone will be looking for this on purpose

So basically, I cracked the top of the skull open in daycare and had be rushed into the hospital. Its kinda funny became I remember the cause of it was I was running around being a character from a show I loved to watch, I think he was called ""Diesel"" or something and he had a claw. I was chasing my friend and my head hit the top of a poll in the playground

I was also molested by my father when I was 7, I didn't realize the things he did was bad until I was 10. 

My sister is a slut (literally) and my brother has anger issues so living with them was hard.

All I really do is play video games, watch Netflix, I'm a huge waste of space. 

My life dog named amber passed away recently. He was a shitzoo, just watching him being put down was terrifying.

I was bullied in school a lot. Had my noes broken, right leg twisted and a bunch of cuts. 

Those are the main reasons for why I'm killing myself. Tried sleeping pills, still can't sleep. I'm extremely depressed, got a phycologists and I'm still depressed.

I think suicide is something people look onto as a bad thing, but its really just a shortcut for life. I mean, we're all gonna die anyway. Suicide isn't selfish in my opinion, being an edgy attention whore is. 

I'll be taking knockout pills and standing on a chair with my head in a noose, the plan is that I'll fall asleep and get hanged. If it takes too long, I'll just do it myself

6iatrq,"I know that when my wife was younger she struggled with suicidal thoughts, but she has continued therapy for the last 18 years and largely been successful.  We've been married for nearly 4 years now and it's a particularly stressful time due to finances, my transitioning to a new job, several major problems with our home, and a viscous lawsuit from a neighbor who wanted our dog.  (Was dismissed but took a year to get to court and was very stressful.)

She seemed to be in fairly high spirits the last three days and this morning was in a particularly good mood.  As the morning went on we talked, I told her how happy I was she'd saved my favorite shirt from a stain, and she was laughing and joking with me.  She decided to do some chores and I played Xbox.  About an hour later I got up to get a drink and noticed she wasn't in the main portion of the house so I went upstairs to check on her.  Found her in bed with a bottle of muscle relaxers I got for a bad back and a bottle of her own daily mood stabilizers.  She had taken about 27 muscle relaxers and around 150 of the mood stabilizers in addition to a full bottle of Tylenol, and she had attempted to use razors to slash her wrists and throat.  Thankfully she is very afraid of cutting herself and was not successful.  I carried her downstairs and took her to the ER.  (Didn't know how many pills she had taken or would have called 911, thought it had been much less.). Took the bottles with me and they sedated her and put her on a breather.  It was absolutely terrifying.
She is in ICU but Tennessee has some rule where nobody can see or visit her until the doctor decides they can so I'm sitting at home trying to decide what to do.  I'm not allowed to call or be there so I got a nurse to let me write her a letter telling her I love her and that I'm willing to do whatever it takes to support her through this rough time.

I've noticed when she drinks she tends to get more depressed, so when I got home I dumped all the alcohol in the house.  I like beer but not as much as I liked her.  Hopefully keeping something that triggers her out of the house will help some.  I kind of feel like I'm taking her choices away though and I want her to feel independent and worthwhile not like a child who is in trouble.  Do you all think this is the right call?

Has anyone had experience with this in Tennessee and if so how long did it take for you to see/be seen by your loved ones?

Since she took my prescription is there any chance of criminal charges?  I don't care about the pills or lawyer bills I just don't think she needs to experience another trial.

Can the state forcibly put her in a treatment facility and if not as her husband can I put her in an outpatient program?  I think she will want to act like this didn't happen but I want her to get help.

If I can put her in an outpatient program do y'all think it would be a positive? Again I want her to feel free and validated.

What things can I do to better prep our home to be a safer environment while she's works through this?

Thanks for reading and for any answers.  It has been a terrible day.",1
5lms87,"Three years ago, I was in the worst place of my life. I had undergone a prolonged and horrific traumatic experience the year before, and then was thrust back into normal life as a ""typical"" high school student. I was surrounded by people who supported my abusers, and felt that what had happened to me was my fault (and people supported this idea). 

And then, I had a glimmer of hope that was so wonderful and unimaginable that not only would all my troubles be subsided, but I felt that it would make all my troubles *worth it*. But alas, I made a very stupid mistake, and I alone sabotaged myself. 

I joined Reddit and found this subreddit, and [cried for help](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1swjeq/what_do_you_live_for_when_you_dont_have_anything/?). Redditers were patient and understanding. 

Of course, I thought much of what they told me (it got better, other great things would happen to me, I would learn to live with my regrets) was bullshit. It annoyed me at the time, though I was warmed by the fact that people sought to comfort me. My mind was going in circles. It was stagnant. I had never experienced that. It was a very dark time.

I had to push through another year - and it was perhaps the hardest year of my life - but somehow, I made it through. You couldn't pay me anything to relive that time. Through fantastically random events, I got the opportunity to leave home and have a ""fresh start,"" and then went off to college, where I was able to think with a clear mind. It wasn't an easy transition. It was easy in some aspects - I wasn't homesick, like others in my college freshman dorm - but looking back on it, it was an adjustment. 

I am now much further into college. Wonderful things have happened in my life, and I truly do like living. It's not that I get up everyday and short, ""I love life!"" But three years ago, if I had a chance to just disappear and stop living in a small, painless instant, I would take it in a heartbeat. Now, I would not. I have had opportunities that are very different from the one I messed up. I can't compare them to the one I lost - it's not that one is better than others; they are merely different. I have been honored to have wonderful experiences that I couldn't have imagined three years ago. 

Back then, I wracked with guilt and shame, hatred for myself and for many others. I hated when people would say, ""It gets better"" because I felt it applied to everyone, but me. But it did. Things did get better. 

Thank you all for your patience. Thank you all for your compassion. Thank you all for your empathy.

ylt41,"A few months ago my fiancé tried to kill himself. He went into treatment and came home and explained to me that his medication was making him belly-sick and he had to stop taking it. He was throwing up from it, getting pale and dizzy, and shaking. 
So I couldn't force him to take it. He found a new job and said he was doing out-patient treatment. 
On Friday he left some suicide notes. He left a will. And on Sunday his body was found. 
I'm completely heartbroken. I can not eat. I do not sleep. I cry. I scream into pillows and talk to him out loud. I ask why. He left me facing an eviction that he hid from me, past due bills that meant my electricity is turned off and my water. I have a four year old son who is staying with family. I don't know how I'll tell him his ""Jamie"" is gone. 
I believe in God so I'm terrified of what happens to his soul. I'm pretty much totally lost. Worse of all, the DEA is watching me because he took pills that he had no prescription for. 
I have to carry on now. For my son. I have nothing left. I'm empty inside. Hollow and at night the silence goes on and on and he's not next to me in our bed... I miss him. And I'm angry. He had another life that I never knew about. He was so far in debt, death treats against his life for unpaid ""stuff"", and he changed my address so I wouldn't receive any mail or notices.

I work in a pub kitchen and today I realised something, I'm really good at what I do and I'm valued in my team. And I had this moment of happiness and I felt great, just to know that in one aspect in my life I'm not totally useless is amazing. I had to get this off my chest, even if nobody reads it.

Edit: after reading the responses you all gave me I genuinely cried, I've never opened up about these kind of things and to have complete strangers reply the way you all did makes me really hopeful, thank you all for the support! To care about a stranger on the internet who you know nothing about shows everything about your character, you are all amazing people and if ever you are feeling down I'm always here to talk. I will never forget that kindness you've all shown me, whenever I'm down I will think about how much of you cared about me. Thank you!

1hiz31,"Many of you gave me lots of words of encouragement, and sent private messages, which absolutely helped me a little bit. I will not say I feel 100% better, I still today am struggling with the same suicidal and self hatred feelings, but I am still alive and that's something.

One of you gave the advice to focus more on myself, and that's exactly what I did today. I woke up, crying from the fact that I woke up and was still alive... then decided you know what? Fuck this. If I'm stuck here one more day, I'm gonna make it great. And you know what? I did.

I immediately went to an apartment viewing that was semi spontaneous... turns out the apartment is literally perfect for me in absolutely every way. They even have a private fenced backyard and ENCOURAGE dogs... which would help with my depression. It is perfect. I am signing a lease this weekend and moving out of my mom's house. Huge step towards a new life.

Then this afternoon, I got a call from a job and they wanted me to come right in for an interview. I got offered a job on the spot and I start tomorrow. He said I seem perfect for the job. This is going to help my money situation as well as keep me busy and occupied when I get depressed.

Then when I came home, my boyfriend (who didn't know of my feelings last night) called me asking to take me on a in-home date including him grilling dinner and us watching a movie and me sleeping over.

If you guys hadn't have put so much effort in keeping me alive last night, none of these things would have happened. I can't say thank you enough. 

Again, like I said, I'm still dealing with a lot of issues and its going to take time, but since I didn't off myself last night, I feel like the universe showed me today that yes, you have the opportunity to have good things happen to you if you just stay here. 

Again, thanks so much to all of you. I cross my fingers that these new developments will help encourage me to stay alive just a little bit longer.

I love you all.",1
6ivi4d,"Where to begin? 

I absolutely trusted this friend/colleague of mine. I expressed my suicidal feelings, and went in-depth on what I've done to myself in terms of both harming as well as trying to better myself. This friend/colleague is also my supervisor, my direct report. We often speak about very personal subjects to each other, which is why I decided to pour my heart out and let them know why I've been a bit 'odd' lately.

A week or so later, I went to seek advice from HR. I asked HR for advice on ""behalf of a colleague who's feeling suicidal etc"", and I was told to come back later to discuss. I then told my supervisor what I had done, and that I'd taken a major step towards seeking help. Unbeknownst to me, she then decided to tell HR that the colleague I was speaking about - was actually myself. After I spoke to HR, I could sense the tension in the air and it was fairly obvious they knew it was me. 

The next day, Police and Paramedics turned up at my house, and literally just removed me from the house. I was about to go to work, but I was told somebody at my workplace has called them.


I have been informed by one of my other Managers that I am no longer allowed to return to work, unless I get a document from the Psychiatrist/Doctor stating that I am fit for work.

I am able to empathise with why my supervisor decided to take the action she did take, but I cannot help but feel absolutely disgusted at the level of betrayal. I would've been fine if she informed me she would be telling HR first, or if she tried to persuade me to tell HR on my own.

I was about to be admitted into a Psychiatric Ward, but fortunately there were no beds available. (I say fortunately because I really wanted to return to work, and to be ""Free"". When I returned from the Hospital, that was when I was told I'm not allowed to return to work)


1. Never trust anybody. As unhealthy as this sounds, you shouldn't confide in anybody at work. Ultimately HR protects the Company first. 
2. It's a huge taboo to speak about severe levels of depression and suicide. People will either think you're insane, or they won't take you seriously.
3. People do not know how to react to the news. I tried to confide in a close friend, and they openly admitted that they don't want to hear me speak about these things, and that it's making them feel a lot of pressure. Others have told me to stop the drama etc. 

All in all, I feel another suicide attempt is imminent. Truth be told, I was genuinely going to walk to a Hospital myself on Tuesday evening after work, but I've had all of this forced upon me on Tuesday Morning all of a sudden because I was stupid enough to tell somebody whom I shouldn't have trusted.

Moral of the story, KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT AND JUST SEEK HELP ON YOUR OWN IF YOU CAN. Don't trust friends, family, anybody at work. Fuck it.

I am:

1. Suicidal, more worse than before.
2. Unemployed as of now. Financially struggling since I used a lot of my wages to support two friends that are going through difficulties of their own.
3. Pretty much nobody I can confide in. 

I am fucking done. Life is a beautiful thing, but it's just not for me. ",1
5hzmys,"My wife and I have been through a lot in the last 5 years. Her brother committed suicide in 2012, and we have struggled with infertility, finally giving up. She's often depressed, binge-watching Netflix in bed on her days off; this is especially bad when she has her periods which have gotten worse as well.

She has her period right now. This morning I got worried about her mental state. She never answers questions about it honestly--will never own up to being suicidal, in particular, though I know she has thought about suicide in the past. I looked through her browser history and found this sequence:

* searches for 1-bedroom apartments in our area
* searches for ""how to get out of a bad marriage""
* searches for ""how to stop suicidal thoughts""
* searches for ""painless suicide methods""
* a visit to her dead brother's facebook page

This scared the shit out of me. I am afraid if I confront her about it she will run away from me. I don't know what to do. She adamantly refuses to go to therapy--she works in healthcare and says therapists are worthless. She has access to powerful drugs through work--she works in a trauma ICU where people often die.",1
5dy9vf,"It hit me hard. It made me want to live for a little while. Half an hour isn't long, but I thought it'd be worth posting just in case if it helps anyone else out there:

 The morning after I killed myself, I woke up.

I made myself breakfast in bed.
I added salt and pepper to my eggs and used my toast for a cheese and bacon sandwich. I squeezed a grapefruit into a juice glass. I scraped the ashes from the frying pan and rinsed the butter off the counter. I washed the dishes and folded the towels.

The morning after I killed myself, I fell in love. Not with the boy down the street or the middle school principal. Not with the everyday jogger or the grocer who always left the avocados out of the bag. I fell in love with my mother and the way she sat on the floor of my room holding each rock from my collection in her palms until they grew dark with sweat. I fell in love with my father down at the river as he placed my note into a bottle and sent it into the current. With my brother who once believed in unicorns but who now sat in his desk at school trying desperately to believe I still existed.

The morning after I killed myself, I walked the dog. I watched the way her tail twitched when a bird flew by or how her pace quickened at the sight of a cat. I saw the empty space in her eyes when she reached a stick and turned around to greet me so we could play catch but saw nothing but sky in my place. I stood by as strangers stroked her muzzle and she wilted beneath their touch like she did once for mine.

The morning after I killed myself, I went back to the neighbors’ yard where I left my footprints in concrete as a two year old and examined how they were already fading. I picked a few daylilies and pulled a few weeds and watched the elderly woman through her window as she read the paper with the news of my death. I saw her husband spit tobacco into the kitchen sink and bring her her daily medication.

The morning after I killed myself, I watched the sun come up. Each orange tree opened like a hand and the kid down the street pointed out a single red cloud to his mother.

The morning after I killed myself, I went back to that body in the morgue and tried to talk some sense into her. I told her about the avocados and the stepping stones, the river and her parents. I told her about the sunsets and the dog and the beach.

The morning after I killed myself, I tried to unkill myself, but couldn’t finish what I started.

gl1h1,"original post: http://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/gajsy/i_wish_i_didnt_have_these_attractions/

So I took some of the comment's advice. I chilled out and met a guy who wanted to hook up. When I got back to my dorm, I had already been feeling a bit sick, that coupled with the fact that I was thoroughly disgusted with myself for enjoying hooking up with another guy made me throw up. I spent the next twenty minutes punching my concrete wall so hard my knuckles started to bleed.

I can't do this, I don't want to live anymore if it means I have to be gay. It makes me physically ill to my stomach if what society's telling me is true: I can't change this. I don't want to be gay more than anything else in the world, I would be okay with being bi, hell, even lying about it would be better. Everyone keeps telling me it would be wrong to get in a relationship with a girl if no sexual attraction was there and if I can't even do that, I don't want to live anymore.

Society would accept me, my friends would all accept me, but they would never treat me the same again. My parents are convinced that homosexuality doesn't exist, that its all based on environment and upbringing, they wouldn't hate me or throw me out, in fact they're the least of my concerns.

Its me mainly, I don't want to be gay. I tried it and it made me sick at my stomach, I hate everything about it from the culture to the fact that I can't live my dream of being married to a beautiful wife with children without somehow being a ""bad person"". I won't accept this, I don't give a shit if you call it self-hatred. I talked to a suicide hotline, they basically talked me out of it and told me the same thing as everyone else, you can't help it. I talked to a guy at our school's LGBT support center, he also said I have no choice in the matter. If this is truly the case then I'm done, fuck it. I will not live my life ""being"" gay and I will not live my life celibate.

Edit: I know this is cliche as hell, but I wanna thank everyone for the encouragement. After about half an hour of reading comments I ran over to the gym for a quick workout sesh and I already feel loads better. For now I'm not gonna worry about it anymore, if suicide is an option, as one of you pointed out, I have a self-determined amount of time before that to do whatever the fuck I want to find out who I am. On top of that, Purple_Antwerp's words really made me realize that I need to man the fuck up and not label myself so I can really find out who I am. Seeing as I'm not an atheist, liberal, or an introvert, its times like these that really make me truly appreciate Reddit.",1
7d7599,"My wife left me in September after 8 years of marriage. This last Saturday, I received a phone call from my wife's number. When I picked up, there was a man's voice on the other end. The first question he asked was why I hadn't already killed myself. I was taken aback at first, then he kept convincing me to do it, with my wife laughing in the background. He kept saying it would be the best thing for everyone if I did so. He told me my sons wanted me to do it as well. I haven't seen them since September. They are only 7 and 6. He said they were his kids now, which made me angry and extremely upset because I am over 200 miles away from them. On Sunday, November 12th, I attempted suicide by overdosing on my heart medication. Before I was fully unconscious, my sister stopped by because she hadn't heard from me in over a day. When I came to, I was in the trauma unit upside down with tubes in my nose and neck, one pumping the contents of my stomach out, while the other was desperately pumping dopamine into my bloodstream. After spending 48 hours in the ICU, I'm home. I have an appointment on the 22nd of November with a therapist and a doctor, but I don't think that's soon enough. I'm scared. And ashamed.

7700d8,"Hi.

My depression has been very bad the past few months. Since I don't have health insurance at the moment, I can't go back to therapy. I was going before but my case was dropped because I missed too many session, and I hate myself now for being so forgetful about them.

I managed to stay home from school today, and since I was alone at home I thought it would be a good chance for me to end my life. Why? I just woke up feeling suicidal is all. There are days where I just want to end it all, and then days where I feel fine and actually want to do things with my life. Its been going on for years. 

At this point in very tired of it.

I spent the last three hours crying in the bathroom with my dad's utility knife, contemplating and hoping to god that no one would come back home and find me there. I eventually just ended up hopping onto reddit and going through this subreddit to see if anyone could help me out. Reading through all the old posts here, it helped me calm down and put the knife away in the closet. So many posts of people deciding not to do it, comments that offered support, it made me feel like someone out there really did care. Even if I've never really talked to anyone here. That isn't weird, right? I hope not.

 My mom came back home and scolded me again for not going to school, which usually makes my mood worse, but this time it actually helped make me feel a bit better. For today, she wouldn't have to worry about coming back home to her daughter's dead body.

I'm in my room now, curled up in bed with my blankets and my teddy bear. ((That's embarrassing to say, but its a special bear for me.)) It's very cold today. The weather has been weird here in NY, but I'm glad that the fall is starting to actually feel like fall for once.

Today was not the day for me to off myself. Thankfully, I managed to calm down and actually managed to feel better, even if it was just a little bit. Hopefully, there will never be a day where I actually do off myself. I don't want to die knowing that I'll probably regret it when it's too late.

I can't promise that I won't do this again, but I do promise that I'll go to school tomorrow. 

Thank you for reading, and thank you for existing.",1

54u7ee,"My girlfriend that I love so very much took her own life last night. She was my best friend and was with me every moment of every day for a very long time. I feel so guilty and like I could have prevented this because earlier in the week before it happened, I had been dealing with her depression and she wouldn't stop taken Xanax which only made the situation way worse. She had been dealing with depression for a long time but this week was so much different. She just wasn't her. Earlier in the week she had gone to the doctor to get her script for Xanax refilled. At the time I didn't think about her depression and she hadn't taken them for months, so I didn't think she would abuse them. But as soon as she started taken them, she immediately started getting super depressed. And only about a day after getting the script she was already threatening to kill herself and was buying more off the street. The first time she attempted to kill herself she texted me and told me she was going to kill herself so I called into work and drove to where she was (her grandparents) so I could comfort her and when I walked in she was playing with guns and swallowing pills from her grandparents medicine cabinet. Somehow that day I got her to calm down but for some reason I didn't tell her grandparents or family as I was afraid of what would happen to her. Me and my sister told her that we could get her help and would take her to the hospital but she refused. As soon as she woke up the next day, she was already back to abusing pills and was going to her aunts to ""clear her mind"". As soon as she got to her aunts, she immediately stole her aunts pills and told me and in fear of her doing something to herself told her aunt and her aunt when she got off work took the pills and also found out she stole money. Her aunt was very upset with her and my girlfriend was so upset because she looked up to her aunt and she was blacked out on Xanax and didn't even remember doing any of it. This night I went ahead and told her family that she had a problem and needed help soon or else I feared for her safety. When she got back, she said she was going to get help and go to rehab and stop doing pills. I believed her. I believed every single word she told me. One day went by and she seemed to be doing fine but then by the end of the night she had told me she bought more Xanax. I lost my cool and exploded on her and we got into a huge fight and I made her leave. I was so mean to her because I was upset that she had bought more xans after telling me she would stop and get help. She went back to her grandparents and was texting me and I was the biggest asshole ever, but I never thought in a million years she would kill herself because she had been depressed for a long time but never actually did anything like this. She walked out to her grandparents cow shed with a pistol and sent me a picture saying I figured out how to use it and sent me a picture with it in her month. Right away I called the police but for some reason I decided to go to sleep because I had to work early and didn't think she would actually kill herself. By the time they got there it was too late and she had already taken her own life. I'm so heart broken I should have forced her to go to the hospital. I should have never made her go home that night and should never have gotten as mad as I did. I should have never gone to sleep thinking nothing would happen. I tried so hard to get her help and told her everyday I loved her and would do anything in my power to get her the help she so rightfully deserved. I don't know what I'm going to do without her. I need her by my side and now that she isn't I just want to end my life as well. I want to be with her so bad. I can't eat and last night sleeping was impossible. I was told by the sheriffs at work the next day that she had passed away. As soon as they showed up I asked them if she was okay and I knew something bad had happened. The sheriff talked to me for awhile asked what happened and I explained everything I had gone through. Then at the end of me explaining, he said I'm sorry to tell you this and I don't know a better way to do so but she passed away last night. I cried so hard and my entire world feels like it has come to an end. He tried to comfort me by saying it seems like you tried doing everything you could and some people just don't want the help. But I know I could have helped her and saved her life had I not set my phone down and fell asleep. I should have been nice and drove out there. She needed me so bad. I can't believe my actions and how fed up I had gotten. She would still be here right now had I drove out there and told her to stop and that I love her. My life feels ruined and it will never be the same. I want to be with her....I think I'm going to be. I feel so guilty too because she only knew what Xanax was because I had shown her months before and got high with her off them for days. But even then she wasn't like this. Man I'm so lost I don't want this anymore. I made the biggest mistake of my life by being mean and putting my phone down and acting like I didn't care. This will eat me alive forever if I don't do it myself. Fuck my life and existence. I miss her and I need her. She understood my depression so well and I fucked up. And it breaks my heart so much that when she made this decision she was fucked up on Xanax. I'm broken my heart literally hurts and I'm only 19 and just lost my dad a year ago.

689a9z,"A few of you might have seen my post last week about having pills and alcohol and wanting to die. Long story short, I didn't die, and I spent one week in an inpatient psychiatric facility with group therapy, regulated meal and break times, and strictly regulated possessions (no phones, shoelaces, plastic bags, or razors were anywhere accessible to patients.) It was the best week of my life.



-
Connecting with people who legitimately understand and can commiserate in my struggles was one of the greatest feelings in the world. In short, I felt alive for the first time in years. The compassion and genuineness in even the most reserved, unkempt, or uninviting individuals opened my eyes to the true significance and meaning in human life. The sheer determination and will of some patients was beyond inspiring, the almost carbon-copy similarities between my story and others' was overwhelmingly soothing, and the guided discussion helped reopen and readdress issues previously long buried. 



-
The people I met in the facility are some that I will never forget. The passionate frustration turned spiritual focus of an older gentleman in and out of prison and homelessness, the reserved kindness in an abused young lady, and the boisterous humor and wheezing laugh of a grandmotherly recovering addict will resonate with me in the years to come. I am in sheer awe and overwhelmed by the passion, the heartfelt connections, and the lasting impressions that a mere seven days has done for me. I finally see the future in a hopeful light, and am ready to face the challenges of reformation, coping, and living. 


-
I want to thank the users here that urged me not to follow through with my plan, even though I ignored their care and worry, and I would like to urge you to watch the movie ""Short Term 12"" for one of the most accurate depictions of the raw appreciation for the value of human life that comes from staying in an inpatient facility. (The movie is about minors, but rings true for the adult side as well.) Sorry for the wall of text, I just wanted to express the appreciation I have for the experiences that have led me to a path of recovery.",1
38eqxb,"About 2 days ago, I was going to kill myself. I stopped before I left my house at 2am, and decided to see if there were any last second resources. I came across Reddit, and read a hilarious, yet serious post about a guy who decided to go to Mexico, buy cocaine, hookers, and alcohol before he killed himself.  He had such a crazy good time, he decided life was worth living for a bit longer.

I laughed and cried because I realized I never did anything like that. While I didn't get hookers and cocaine (I'm a mother of 2 children and married), I did buy a laptop and had a fantastic meal by myself (And great beer.) 

So, Mr.cocaine and hookers...thank you for your post. I seriously was ready to off myself....but you showed me sometimes you have to do something crazy for yourself. While my version of ""wild good time"" differs, it's good to focus 100% on you for a bit.

4vcm7w,"Okay so before anyone gets offended at what I'm about to say, just trust me when I say that I don't wish people with depression would die, but I wish that it could kill *me* naturally. Yes depression does kill in the sense that it can cause suicide (and often does) but I wish that this mental illness could cause a more natural death. Like for instance, if a person leaves diabetes undiagnosed, it could be fatal, as is with many other diseases and infections. Why does something like depression make someone want to die mentally, but not allow them to? In a sense, it's just suffering that may end because it makes you stressed and more susceptible to certain things, but it will never end your suffering by itself. 



I'm gonna be honest I am in so much mental pain. I have nothing that makes me very happy anymore. I hate myself more than anything and anyone. I really want to die, but I don't want to make people grieve over me. I think eventually I might go through with it though. I have so much shit to deal with, not sure how much longer I can do this.

Idk how many of you care but I thought I'd share this... ",1
65nd6i,"Planning to off yourself is annoyingly intricate. You have to figure out where and how and when. Where can you go that no one you care about will find you, but someone else will. How are you going to do it? You've Google searched ""Least painful ways"" but where will you get the supplies and how will you keep anyone from finding out? 

The most complicated piece to me is when. Should you do it before or after your family vacation? You wouldn't want to ruin it for everyone, but it seems phony to go along. Do you have enough money saved up so your husband can still pay the rent for a while? You did just sign a new lease last month. Do you have time to touch base with the people you'll miss the most and let them know how special and important they are to you. 

Should you write a note? If it doesn't work are you prepared to live on under worried, watchful eyes and heavy prescription that makes you feel even emptier than you already are? 

You don't know how people can just pick a day and step off the side of a bridge.

You keep telling yourself, ""Next week is the week. No more procrastinating. It's not rocket science."" 

In the end you'll probably just postpone it a little longer. Not because you're afraid to do it, you're not. You're just to afraid to leave any burden on all the hearts left behind.

79qhc5,It’s hitting me hard,1
6orm0k,"Hey dude! What's up you lightbulb head (hehehe, I always remember that weird haircut you got once). I know this will sound like a sad joke, my bro, but, I hope you'll read this after I'm gone. 

I mean, like, gone. Forever. 

If you’re reading this, I finally became the happy man you know I wanted to be.

I do know you tried your best and accepted me when I came out to you as bi earlier this week. I know you told me ""nothing is gonna change, ever! You're a good man, I don't care who you sleep with"". You put a very awkward face when you started to ask me about my ""male crushes"" and all I could say was ""Mark Wahlberg""... But I liked it. You made me smile for the very first time in months that moment. I do know you had good intentions when you told me today you wanted to introduce me to one of your male friends so I could ""who knows?"". I know I was 12 years older than you, I know all the ""You're so old that..."" jokes were in good nature (for real! Every laugh was from the heart), and despite you were barely 18, you were one of the most mature and down to earth men I've ever knew in my whole and disgraceful life. I will always love you for being the kind of friend you were. You were like my real other half. You were not only my best friend, but also the little brother I always wanted to have when I was a small kid. Please don't let the guys in college know the truth about my true sexuality... It was already extremely shameful to talk about that; but, I felt I had to tell you the truth before leaving this nightmare. I felt like inside a maze every single day. I had to wake up everyday feeling like I wasn't capable of deserving love, companionship, or even friends. ...and it was true. Deep down. Despite I had a partner (yep, a partner I never wanted to introduce you to), he just used to gave me the could shoulder (sometimes for a whole week) everytime he was so proud of himself to accept my apologizes if I did a mistake. Those kind of things also used to hurt me very, very deeply.

Please don't blame yourself. You did everything you could, and every afternoon you made me forget everything I was living in my life: The real hell of not being able to talk about your partner. The hell of fearing that ""anyone"" could discover your true colors... The fear of feeling like a total fraud, like a failure, like a mistake, like a total error of nature. Feeling that my true self was wrong. You know I wasn't a religious man, and, despite you do are one, you respected me and always talked to me about God without attempting to convert me. I always loved that. 

But, my dear bro, I can't take this anymore. 

I feel like I don't belong in anyone’s lives. I always feel like I'm the one who doesn't fit in their lives. Everything feels like taken from a distant past, but twisted and destroyed with an evil intention. Besides I was afraid because I didn't want to go to the doctor to check my heart... I didn't want to know if I had a health condition. If I had it, now it doesn't matter anymore. Please don't blame yourself. You gave me many good afternoons, and by the way, you have one of the purest souls on this world. Writing this makes me real sad, but in the end, please know that I'll be in a better place, I guess. (At least that's what people say when someone dies).

Remember me everytime you have a beer
Remember me everytime you eat chinese food (remember?)
Remember me everytime you listen to the birds
Remember me everytime you feel the sun on your shoulders
Remember me everytime you feel you're without a rock to hold on
Remember me everytime you have an ice cream (Remember the time we had ""a fight"" to be the first to get the only Lemon ice cream left on the store?)
Remember me everytime you workout... Despite you're not the sporty type. My only dreams in life were: Moving out of the country, and working out. Being able to have a body like Wahlberg's... Or at least to have a ripped body, nothing too big. I also wanted to play rugby since I can remember, but I always felt like I didn't belong there, so... I spent many times watching the people playing and saying ""I wish I could be him"". Same everytime I walked by a gym... I used to see the perfect guys lifting weights and sighing ""I wish I could be him"". But, what was the use for? To join a gym/rugby team to be the clown? To get bullied because ""hey rookie, wtf are you doing here? Get out"" after laughing so hard... Just like in HS. 

Remember me. Please. Remember me ANY TIME you feel you have a true friend. Because, despite I'm now leaving this disaster, you will always be not only my classmate, but also my best, and only, true friend. 

You are an OUTSTANDING guitar player, please keep playing it. You can be a true rockstar like the ones you admire if you work hard! I was too old to see you achieving that, but, I would have loved to hear your name being chanted by a whole stadium full of fans. 

Please, do love your dad and your stepmom. I know they're not perfect people, but, they're your parents after all. Please take care of them.

Please, finish our major! Please do a great job. Please EXCEL in anything you want to do with your life (even if that means drinking ice cold beer and that bbq with orange juice and honey I know you love!)

I'll mail you this letter (the link), and my mom's phone. I know my guitar was stolen, so, I'm sorry you won't get it; but, you can take my amplifier. It's a professional one, and it's in an almost mint condition. It was my baby despite I didn't feel I had talent to play the guitar. Please love my (now yours) amplifier the way I never did. You can also keep my PC. It has a ton of great games, so, you'll barely be bored. 

Thank you, and I mean: THANK YOU for everything. Please keep being such a bright light. 

I love you my lil bro. Too bad we weren't actually biological brothers. I will always, and I mean ALWAYS will love you. And, as the poem says... ""Don't stand up on my grave and weep"". You'll look like a leaking watermelon hehehe. Please don't get that haircut again. 

All the best.

52yool,"I'm not even really depressed, I just get stressed out sometimes. I feel like if all it took to end it was to open a drawer and pull the trigger, I totally wouldn't have held out this long.

I post here, saying I'm gonna end it all, and all of a sudden there's an outpouring of support and people telling me to contact them if I need to, saying I need to reach out and get help, etc etc etc. 

And it's the same shit offline, too. You tell someone you're depressed and sad, and it's like 'yeah okay but when are you *not*?', but as soon as you say you wanna kill yourself people suddenly care. 

It's all for selfish reasons, too. No one wants to be the one who ignored a suicidal person, but it's fine to brush off someone before they get to that point. 

Like. Yall do realize that feeling alone and helpless is what pushes people to that point, right?",1

They proceeded to get upset with me and despite my attempt at explaining my situation and another try at asking for support, they called me a wide array of colorful language and left.

Well, I apologize for not meeting your expectations of how a suicidal person should be. I guess it's really immoral of me to have such feelings because I clearly shouldn't be allowed to. I suppose all I really am is a selfish ungrateful creep, just like you so vividly exclaimed to me.

You know what, here, I'll make it up to you, I'll kill myself tonight, and maybe then you'll believe me.",1
3uqe2h,...and then suddenly your life doesn't belong to you because ending it would make other people sad. As if they don't have the option to end their lives if it becomes unbearable.

1od97b,"People come here looking for help and you know what people respond in the comments after pouring their life out to strangers because they can't or wont to people in their life? They get comments like these;

That comments are crazy supportive and different if the person admits they are a [woman](http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1obvlw/i_cant_make_the_pain_stop/).

You have no idea where these people are in their lives or what could push them over the edge. I read one comment saying how their parents would miss them. But the fact is you don't know if the person coming here for help told you everything, you don't really KNOW anything about them. How do you know their parents aren't causing a bunch of their heart ache?

The last 4 months for me, have been a day in and day out struggle of mental agnoy.  I agonized each moment I was alive and I prayed for death.  There were incredible experiences sprinkled in between, but the moment they ended, I was back to this agonizing state.  It was the closest I ever came to suicide.

FUCK the red pill. FUCK their alpha-male beta-male bullshit.
I posted here a week ago, I felt like shit. I mentioned that I was 20m, a virgin, never been kissed before, never had anyone interested in me before, and someone directed me to /r/theredpill.

I can't find the thread anymore, but the first thread I clicked on was about Asians. I didn't read the thread, but I looked at the comments. The comments were talking about how a ""white beta-male"" can easily date an Asian because all asian men are ""super beta males"". Another person commented that out of all men, Asian men are at the bottom. More commenters posted about how they are so thankful that Asian men are so pathetic, because they get so much Asian ""pussy"" because of it.

As an Asian male who spent most of middle school bullied by white people, this was a MASSIVE trigger. 

I replied something. The person who posted to my /r/sw thread labeled me as a perpetual victim, said he can't help someone as pathetic as me, and deleted his posts a few hours later (or got deleted, idk)

GOD. FUCK YOU. FUCK ALL OF YOU. 

I feel trapped today. All my childhood my dad called me worthless, and told me that I deserved to be thrown away (INB4 racist assholes talking about asian parents, DAE THINK ASIAN PARENTS LOL). He's a better person now, doesn't get angry, forgot all about what he did when he was a troubled person. Good for him. 

I feel like this all the time. I feel like nobody gives a shit about me. I'm just some.. fucking asian guy. There's so many Asians on campus, nobody gives a shit. 

I don't have much support. I haven't spoken to my parents in months. Last two times I expressed my suicidal idelation to my friends, they called the police. I got in trouble with the police. I had to be brought into inpatient treatment. My dad couldn't speak good english. Those racist assholes were rude to my father, and me. Those pieces of shit won't listen to me, because what I said didn't matter. They forced me to take all these tests, forced $1000s of bills onto my family, wouldn't listen. Wouldn't care. Just some fucking asians. Just fucking hospitalize him, it follows procedure and minimalizes the time we have to spend talking to him. 

fuuck.
So I can't tell anyone about this anymore. I feel trapped. I don't have a plan. Well I kind of do have a plan. It involves generating carbon monoxide using charcoal and concentrating it in my car. I don' t know when I'm going to do it though. I need to seal my car with duct tape so the gases don't leak out. 

I'm going to do it soon.

People always told me that my problems don't matter. They always told me that it's fine for me to be what I am. I would believe them for a while.  Then I would see them make fun of another friend for only having 1 sexual partner. I would see them make another shitty joke about Asian men. Then I realize that it's all bullshit. All fucking bullshit that they feed to me so I won't kill myself.

I won't even bother telling them. If I told them, they would call the police, I would get in trouble, and my family would be even more in debt. Fuck that.

I don't give a shit who I hurt. Nobody gives a shit about how much I hurt every day. They just feed me some random bullshit in hopes that it would ""reach"" me and keep me alive longer. I'm completely numb to everything they say now.",1
3om7xa,"Reddit, I'm really emotional right now, so I'm sorry if my words seem jumbled. Throwaway for obvious reasons. For reference, I am a bisexual woman.

So last night, my now ex-girlfriend--the person I've been in love with for 4 years--broke up with me, saying that she never loved me to begin with and that she was sorry for stringing me along for so long. She said that my anxiety made her uninterested and too high-maintenance. I had a severe emotional breakdown afterwards. I begged her to try, that maybe she would fall in love with me, but she refused and now has blocked my number. I truly thought she loved me. She sent me loving letters since we were long-distance, kissed me, held me, everything. I envision no life without her. 

This morning, I skipped my first class and made an effort to go to my second one. I had a plan that I was going to return to my dorm afterwards and slit my wrists in the shower (I've had a long history of self-harm). However, I was so emotionally destroyed that I could not make it through my second one and left halfway through. I put my hood up and began back to dorms. I was just so ready to end it; I don't want to live life without her. 

But about halfway through my commute, I felt someone touch my shoulder. It was some random guy I've never seen before. He smiled at me and said, ""Hey there, stranger, you look like you're on a quest."" And for about five minutes or so, we talked. We introduced ourselves, he said he liked my name, etc. Then he said, ""You look stressed. You kind of look like you want to die."" At this point, I was choking back tears--who wants to have an outburst in front of a stranger? He smiled again and said, ""I'm not sure if it's midterms or something else, but stress and grief are normal. You seem like a very strong person. It's okay to talk to people. You will be fine and life goes on."" We then departed; he waved and said he'd see me around. 

I went about five more feet and I broke down. This complete stranger, unbeknownst to him, had just saved my life. I was so ready to kill myself, at this very moment, and he must have sensed something was wrong when he passed me by. He reached out to me. He's probably in class right now while I write this and is already on the road to forgetting. 

But I will not forget. John, thank you. You probably don't know it, but you saved somebody today. I can make it until tomorrow because of you. Just by trying to comfort a stranger, you have saved one less life from ending early. Again, I can't thank you enough.",1

1ojft1,"Her beautiful hair still shone against the white tiles of the bathroom floor, hours after she was gone. I might have thought she was sleeping if she hadn't been so pale. Where did the roses in her cheeks go? They're never going to be able to get her blood out of that bathroom. They can scrub all they like, but the way her life looked, dried and flaking on the floor, they can't make the tiles forget that. They can't make me forget that.

It's been a month. I haven't slept, not really. I don't want to sleep again. She called me at 3:32 in the morning. I was out, I was staying with a friend. I had fallen asleep so deeply. I missed her call. I haven't missed a 3:32 since that day. Even when I'm so drunk I can't think straight, I find the clock and watch until the minute hits.

She touched so many things in this house. I can't live here anymore. I keep finding her fucking hair ties everywhere. She used to tie up her beautiful, beautiful hair when we would make love. I loved the curls, I loved watching the light reflect off of the copper of her hair. Sometimes there are still hairs attached to the ties. I used to rag on her for forgetting her hair ties, I even bought her a huge package of them as part of a present once. I find them less often now, but I know there are more.

I've known her for more than half of my life. When I met her, I had hardly hit puberty. There was never anyone else. There never could be anyone else. How can you replace the stars? How can you find something that takes your breath away the same way that the moon can? My moon is gone and I'm out of orbit, I'm hurtling through space and I cannot stop.

Her favorite color was red. I bought her a red carnation on the day of our anniversary, every month. When I asked her to marry me, I covered our bed in red carnations. She loved carnations, she always bought a bouquet whenever she went grocery shopping. Not red, though. That was our color. That was our symbol. I want to burn every red carnation on earth.

Our wedding was supposed to be in May. We were so excited, we had it all planned out. We would go to Colorado, where we grew up, we would get married under the open sky. Red carnations everywhere. I didn't even think we needed to be married, personally, and she agreed; but we had to put on a show for the family, how could anyone understand that we were already a whole? We were already a single person in two bodies, already in sync. Now I am half of a person.

Her name was April. She was so tiny. She looked like a little fairy, all delicate bones and thin limbs and graceful movements. She danced, and it took my breath away every time. She barely came up to my shoulder, she called me her tree. She would hug me with her whole body, like a koala, and she weighed nothing at all. I could have walked around all day with her arms and legs around me.

I would give my life to have her hug me again. I would give my entire existence to touch her, to see her green eyes and to rub the freckles that ran across her nose with my thumb again. I would gladly suffer the worst tortures that human existence has to offer, if only I could see her smile again. Just once.

I am not old. But I feel as though I'm a hundred. It hurts to move, it hurts to wake up in the morning alone. I can't live in this house anymore. She is in it, but not where I can hold her.

She suffered from depression. There were months where she couldn't get out of bed, she couldn't hold a job, she doubted everything. I thought she was getting better. She smiled more. I thought she was healing and I thought she knew enough to know that I'm not alive without her. Maybe I'll kill myself. Right now I can't bring myself to do it.

There will never be another happy day again. She was my entire life, she was my best friend, my other half, the only person who could calm me when I lost my temper, the only one who I could stay up all night with just talking. Even after years of being together. We shared secrets that nobody else could ever know. I will get blackout drunk again tonight and wait until 3:32 AM and cry, and cry, and I don't know how I can still cry because I've cried so much. 

I write her name like a madman, over and over on paper, because maybe if I write it for the thousandth time she'll come back. Maybe the millionth time. I'll keep trying, I'll keep writing it and remembering her and finding her hair ties and reading her notes that she would write in the books she loved best. She read such depressing things. I'll listen to The Moon and Antarctica because she loved Modest Mouse and she sang along to every song and maybe if I listen hard enough I'll hear her voice in the music too.

I love you, April. Maybe one day I'll get up the courage to see you again, so that I can tell you how much I love you. I can't forget you like I can't forget how to breathe or blink. April come back please I need you. Why did you leave? Why did you do it? How could you leave me here in this house that we bought, alone in the dark? I'm so sorry I missed your call. I'm so sorry I failed you. I'm so sorry for everything, every fight we had. I would give my life to have come home to you that night. Everything still smells like you. I want to burn this house down and take myself with it. But first I'll finish this whisky.",1

pub8f,"This person is still trying to undermine our mission.  Our OPs are getting PMs that sound compassionate and seem factual on the surface.  Their true goal is to make suicide seem like a safe and painless idea, and make seeking help sound difficult and dangerous.  Despite what the PMs claim, please be assured of the following:

* The SW moderators truly cannot trace the source of any post.  We more than anyone else desperately wish we could sometimes, but it's just not possible.   The troll claims that we traced someone this way in December 2011, but this OP was actually located by standard internet searches.

* Calls to suicide hotlines do not regularly result in involuntary psych holds and expensive ambulance bills.   It's possible, but it's rare and is  unlikely unless you are uncooperative with the hotline responders.  This person is trying to scare people out of using the best help that's out there.

* The PM claims that you can help your loved ones avoid suffering by killing yourself by one of the ""painless"" methods.   This is an extremely dirty trick of psychological manipulation, as one of the highest risk factors for suicide is a sense of being a burden.  Please be assured that according to the [actual experts](http://books.google.com/books?id=RSt4hnnKoWkC), the only thing a person struggling with suicidal thoughts can do to significantly reduce their loved ones' suffering is to get some real help.

*  The troll is also subverting the mission and intent of Exit International.  Their Peaceful Pill handbook, which the PM links to, explicitly states that anyone struggling with depression should not be exposed to this material.

Guys, please don't leave us too early. I know it feels like the only option but I promise you, it isn't. 

My heart has never been so broken yet so happy today when he finally woke up and spoke, even if it was just to say he needed to pee. My 16 year old brother is going to make it. I felt so much numbness and pain these past two days having to watch him lay in a hospital bed, not able to respond and not looking alive at all. I think he's going to make it guys. He's talking, he's moving and he's okay. 

I also wanted to thank everyone who commented and supported telling him he had more to live for on his post. Amy, thank you. Everyone else, thank you. I appreciate your effort, support and love that was portrayed to a stranger who needed someone. ",1

Update:
 
It’s about 24 hours exactly since I overdosed and slit my wrist and I’m doing pretty alright. I’m still waiting to be discharged while they run final tests and have still felt quite low.  But the heartfelt messages left in the comments have really made me feel a whole lot better, so thank you for those. 

In total I took a cocktail of about 150-200 pills, types of antidepressants, lots of painkillers, even I think a few antibiotics lmao. I spent the night in A&E hooked up to drips and getting blood tests and threw up about the equivalent of my body weight. But I’m feeling I lot better physically now, just very tired and will probably have some pretty grim scarring on my arm. I do almost feel relieved that I’m alive though which is hopeful. Thank you for caring-",1

The military base has a curfew of 8:00pm and I was walking outside at night. A police cruiser flags me and the officers make me show ID because they said I look 12. Afterwards they laugh and say ""well shit, look on the bright side, at least kids clothes are cheaper than adult ones"". Then they leave.

It's not the first time something like this happened, my entire life I've been walked all over and treated like a monkey just because of how I look. People push me aside on the street. Bartenders don't serve me for 20 minutes.

It also explains my lack of dating life. No wonder women are so repelled by the very sight of me. Getting with me would feel like raping a toddler.

I love that little boy (he's 16) and thankfully he's okay now, but every time I close my eyes I see him hanging there face blue tongue hanging out of the side of his mouth.

""We know you tend to go to dark places,"" they said, ""it's the best thing for you to go back because we care"" they said. In other words, ""fuck off because we don't wanna deal with your shit ever again."" Not that I blame them, I've always been a complete failure and disappointment to everyone I've ever known. I can never do anything right. I've been suicidal for 3 years, and now God is giving me a chance, THE chance, to actually do it.

I've fought for 19 years to get out of that piece of shit of a third world country where I was born and suffered my whole life. I did. And now I fucked up, yet again, like I do everything in life. I will not be getting another chance. I was suspended for one semester last year, had to go back to my country where I suffered for another 6 months. Now they are expelling me, with no means to come back to the US. And I am NOT going back to my country, ever again.

I live in North Carolina, and I'll be starting off to Grand Canyon first thing in the morning, where I'll be ending it all. I plan on going to all the states and places that I've always wanted to visit but never got the chance to. This might sound morbid, but if anyone's down to commit suicide together, shoot me a message, and I'll come pick you up, wherever you are. I have all the time in the world, plenty of money, and nothing to lose.

And don't try to convince me not to. You'd be doing the exact same thing if you were in my position. It's the only ting left I could do.

tl;dr, failed college, have to go back to my piece of shit of a third world country where I fought my whole life to get out of, in 15 days. I'm never going back, ever again. Will be driving to Grand Canyon, my dream place, where I'll be ending it all.",1

She was the most kind and sweet and caring person I have ever known. I love her more than anything in the world, I just don't know what to do without her. She was my everything. Throughout my whole life I've been depressed. The only time I ever felt truly happy in my life was these four years I had with her. I feel lost without her. I was depressed and alone before I met her. She is the only person who ever understood me, who loved me and could make me happy. The only time I ever enjoyed my life were the moments I shared with her. I just don't see why I should go on. I don't hate my job that much and it pays well but why do I keep going? She was the only reason I got out of bed every morning, my only motivation to go to work. Everything I've done in the past 4 years I did for her. Why couldn't it have been me instead? I wish I was dead. Why do horrible things have to happen to the most kind and amazing and caring people? Nothing in this fucked up world is fair. The one time in my life I'm finally happy it gets fucking torn away from me. This isn't how it was supposed to end, we were meant to get married and have a family together, and be happy. She deserved so much better than this. I just don't want to keep living without her. I've never been religious but I desperately hope I can be with her again in whatever next life there is. Maybe if I end it all I can finally be in her arms again. To anyone reading this, I beg you. If you have someone you care about, please, cherish and love them like every day might be their last. The last time I talked to her was a stupid and petty fucking argument. I want to hear her beautiful voice again. I wish I could see her just one more time and say goodbye and I'm sorry and hold her. I want to die and for this pain to stop. Why me? I had a fucked up childhood and a shit life, and when I manage to overcome that and find someone who gives my life meaning I lose her. I have nothing left without her. I don't enjoy any hobbies, I have no friends or family left. She was the only thing I had. I can't think of a single reason to stick around. This is tearing me apart. I'm broken without her. I would give anything to see her again, even once. I want to hear her voice again. I desperately hope I can be with her again no matter how I die. Jesus christ, Lilly, I love you so much, I'm sorry. I miss you. 

I just had to get that off my chest, I hope you understand if you're reading it. I don't think I'll kill myself immediately, but I know it will be one day. I just can't keep going like this. I guess I'll stay around until her funeral at least, but after that I have nothing. And I don't know what the fuck I'll say there, god knows how I'll manage to not be crying my eyes out alone the whole time. I've got a few weeks, maybe months left before I completely break down without her. Maybe not today, but I know my life is over. I can't go one minute without seeing her beautiful face and thinking of how much she loved me. I wish I was fucking dead, I just want this pain to stop. I want to go to sleep and never wake up again. After her funeral I'm just going to sell everything I have and give all my money to charity, sign up to donate my organs and end it all. I've just suffered too much, I can't take it. ",1

i've never considered suicide up until i was 26 despite a lot of people committing suicide around me. when i was a kid, i had a simple dream. i failed to achieve even that. i have given up on working hard and sacrificing my life, energy and sanity because i never get anything in return. i cry whenever people say they earn a living wage in an office job by mostly going on reddit or youtube. i've never been in a relationship nor have i ever been intimate with a woman but that doesn't bother me as much as it used to when i was a teenager. i've never had any desire for human contact. i just want my own apartment and work a job where i just turn up to go to work and leave when time is up.",1

7fh40v,"Why doesnt the thought of losing your relative frighten people? Why are we so tone deaf to how we put ppl down until theyre history? Why is the thought of wanting to die a joke to some people?

Why dont we take depressesion seriously until we have to bury someone we know, say goodbye to a famous celebrity, or feel it ourselves. Why did we laugh at Ronda Rousey for saying she wanted to kill herself after the cyber bullying due to that loss. We know damn well if she did, we would be showing fake concern for retweets and likes such as #RIPRonda.

Death, self inflicted does not matter to society, because its our fault, according to them. The pain I feel everday, you just feel like walking to a isolated area and giving up. Depression is like a sand castle, builds up as if an invisible force wants you to be frustrated and downright done.

Anxiety, anxiety, anxiety. It owns my life like no other. I cant even explain how demon possesed I am with it, it is cripling. My family is struggling, if I die, I can only imagine the downward spiral it can send them. But I cant reach out either.

Why would I? So some bitch on the other end of the phone line will contact the cops and send them to my adress? So I can be locked up in some facility? So my school counselor or therapist will contact higher authorities and get my ass busted?!

If my family finds out I am LGBT, I am so dead. So I doubt that getting help is what I need. The only option is death, or continue drowning in unrelatable anxiety. ",1

When I booked the appointment I didn't mention suicidality, I just said I'm anxious and feeling depressed.
 
At first the doctor asked me different questions. She me asked about my sleeping routine, if I have symptoms of diabetes and if anything has happened recently. She didn't make me to do any depression test. No mention of suicidality yet so I decided to tell her myself.

After that she got more serious and asked me if I have plans and means to commit it. I told her I do. Then she asked if I have any firearms at home, in which I answered yes.

She prescribed me escitalopram and told me that it is just a first aid and further work has to be done. Then she asked if she can book a psychiatric for me. I allowed her to. She put me on the top of the waiting list because I am deemed to at high risk of suicide.

When I was leaving she asked if I'm gonna kill myself when I get home. I told her that I'm not going to kill myself right now. Where I live it is illegal to place someone in involuntary treatment/program even if you told you're gonna kill yourself right when you get out btw.

4t755n,"I have this certainty, almost comforting, that eventually, I am going to kill myself. It is like I have always known that my death will be by my own hand.

About six weeks ago I had my first suicide attempt. It was, however, nothing like I had always thought about it. It was sudden. Unplanned. Almost on impulse. In fact, it was like I wasn't even in control. I've thought about it a lot, and slitting my wrists was never really a viable option for me. Yet that night I *came to* or regained my senses, for lack of a better term, with a kitchen knive in my wrist, a pool of blood forming around me as I sat sobbing on the kitchen floor. All I remember is the pain. I remember thinking that I wanted to just drag the knife further down and get it over with. But it just hurt too damn much. And realising I had failed at yet another thing, I cried even more. And that's where my wife found me.

A week later a was staring at a pathetically small scar on my arm as I sat in a therapists office, too worried about how I was going to afford the sessions to actually focus on what I was actually there for.

But the one thing that came out there was that I have always known I was eventually going to commit suicide.

My wife was sympathetic and very supportive for about two or three weeks after. It was some of the best times of my life. I was still depressed, ironically feeling like more of a failure, but I felt good, felt happy more than usual. But I also knew it would end. It always does.

Tonight is one of those nights again. I want to go. I know I will eventually do it. I don't have the guts to do it tonight, don't worry, but if I could just press a button right now that would allow me to not wake up tomorrow, I would.

xgrba,"**We have tolerated (with concerns) this type of post in the past but it's becoming excessive.  Based on discussion among the mod team and [with the community](http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/x80ja/what_does_sw_think_about_the_im_here_to_help_pm/), our consensus is that these posts are not helping the community, and we're going to start removing them.**

Our reasons are:

1.  The vast majority of the ""let me help"" type posts come from people who have little or no history of constructive, visible contributions here at SW.  Therefore, there's no way to tell much about their ability to give supportive and useful responses.  In particular, having survived a period of suicidality and recovered may *sometimes* make you good at suicide intervention, but sometimes it makes you terrible at it. The bottom line is that we have no way to vet our helpers except through their *visible* contributions to the community.  

1.  Speaking of visibility, we're pretty sure that the 90/10/1 rule applies here at SW just like elsewhere on the Internet.  So, if you help out by commenting on a post, chances are you'll provide support and comfort to 10 suicidal people instead of just 1.  

1.  People talking to our suicidal OPs and lurkers offline can easily become [overwhelmed with situations that are more intense or dangerous than they can cope with](http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/x80ja/what_does_sw_think_about_the_im_here_to_help_pm/c5m438s).  If the conversation happens with the whole community, we can share the burden.  In real-life high-risk suicide intervention situations (e.g. hotlines), there are always multiple people involved because nobody can think of everything, and *everybody who's helping needs support themselves*.

1.  Soliciting PMs is particularly dangerous because it creates expectations that you may not be able to fulfill.  A lot of the risks associated with getting personally involved with suicidal people, as outlined in [our ""don't share contact info"" post](http://www.reddit.com/r/SWResources/comments/dmu24/why_shouldnt_i_share_my_contact_information/) in /r/SWResources apply to these situations. If you invite PMs and then fail to provide *all* the help that somebody needs, you're likely to leave them even worse off than if you'd done nothing.  A disappointing experience with seeking help is the last thing that somebody at risk for suicide should be put through.  

1.  The highest value of the SW Community is that the interactions happen out in the open where people can be anonymous, but where the help and advice and can be critiqued and debugged by the community.  This is why we are much more strict in enforcing our guidelines for the people offering help, and more lenient with those in need of it.   No matter how wise and experienced you are, sometimes you'll say the wrong thing, or miss saying something important that needs to be said.  Again, in real-life situations, the primary responder always has somebody looking over their shoulder, listening in, and offering suggestions.  

1.  People seem to make these posts in lieu of responding to the OPs who have taken the emotional risk and posted their stories.  Imagine what it's like to make a post where you put your pain and fear out there, and get few or no helpful responses.  Then you refresh the front page, and somebody has *ignored* your post and made a generic ""I'm here to help!"" post.  

1. These posts are essentially redundant; SW by nature is a place where everybody's either here to get help or give it.  Since our volume is small,  these announcements always use up a slot on the front page for a while and take visibility away from the posts made by people in need.  

##All of this is ***in no way*** meant to discourage anybody who needs help and doesn't want to post from asking someone in our community to talk via PM.   If you're scared to post even with a throwaway account, please look at the comments and ask somebody who looks like they're someone you can talk to, or message the moderators.  Also, if you get a PM request asking for private help, we are **absolutely not** suggesting that you say ""no"".  If you get a request of that nature that you don't feel equipped to handle on your own, please message the moderators and we'll do whatever we can to assist.

Ten years ago I almost almost killed myself because a girl broke up with me. I stood on a bucket and had a rope around my neck.

I chickened out, stepped down, and pathetically wept myself to sleep. 

I was a slip or a step away from dying.

Tonight, I just finished baking a pumpkin cheese cake. My beautiful wife is sitting on the couch, wrapped in a fleece blanket and watching A Christmas Story.

My five month old daughter, Lily, is asleep in her crib in little red reindeer foot pajamas that say ""Baby's first Christmas.""
Tomorrow we'll wake up in a house we own. I'll cook breakfast, and we'll celebrate our first Christmas together as a family.

I'm newer to Reddit, but not new to the internet. Message boards, and anonymous friends give us somewhere to laugh, vent, cry, and scream. They've got me through some really dark times.

735ebe,"Hey everyone, hope your night has been better than mine. I've been lying in bed for about 4 hours now trying to think of a reason to move but I just cant find one. I'm 20 years old and I disgust myself. I can't get a job and my parents pay for my apartment and my college. They think that I have a plan to use my major and that I'm having the time of my life at this school but the truth is I'm completely lost and alone. My grades are fine but I'm not on track to graduate or get any internships (a death sentence in todays economy). I also spend every night locked in my room alone listening to my roommates and neighbors party. 

In a year or so I'm going to have to take care of myself completely: get a job I hate and be even more isolated than I am now. I don't want that. I want to be a teenager again. I spent my teens being a nerdy straight edge loser. I never went to dances in high school, never asked out any of my crushes, never went on a spring break, never got drunk in college, never rushed a fraternity, never made friends in the dorms, never got to experience young love.

 I missed out on so many parties, events and memories during the most important decade of my life and its left me to be an emotionally stunted shell. I have nothing to look forward to except work and loneliness because all of the best things in life passed me by. Whenever I remember all the old young adult stories I read in middle school I can barely believe that I'm actually older than all of those characters. I feel like a child, scared and helpless. I'm weak, unattractive to women and made fun of by guys. Its all my fault for letting my teens escape unchallenged. I'm soft, lazy and completely outmached by the amazing, beautiful and motivated people that surround me.

 If I had just done things differently for the last few years I probably could have had everything I want: friends , sex, career prospects; but instead I'm burning away my parents life savings to sit and cry alone on a squeaky bed. I dont want to live this life anymore; I just want to go back, I just want to make things right. ",1

5ltyo7,"I just woke up. 

I didn't know that I was so ready to willingly take my own life, until one thing pushed me off the edge and in a moment of panic, sorrow, and pure anger I did the only thing that's been on my mind for so long. 

I like to joke with my friends and say ""I'll die the same way I came in...by accident"". But no, I always believed I'd follow my fathers footsteps. From the moment he took his own life when I was just 15, I've always wondered when I'd do the same. 

But I woke up. 

Covered in my own vomit, luckily I didn't choke on it. If you want to call it luck. I didn't see any light, I didn't have any massive realization of what life is and why I want to stay, no. Nothing has changed. All this has done is add a counter to my life, and it was just incremented by one. Suicide attempts. 
I remember when they called me out of school, stepping into the car with my mother having no idea anything was wrong. I only talked to him once or twice a week, and we had just made plans the day before to meet the day after. His last message was simply ""see you soon, buddy"". 

I didn't want to, Reddit. But I woke up. 

And I'm not ready to try again. I don't want to, I don't need to. I'm just a husk, and I'm okay with that. As the quote goes ""You are the universe experiencing itself"" Life is meaningless. But I don't need life to have a meaning. I will simply exist from now on, letting life happen around me. I will live only for myself. This is my life, it's all I have, and it's all I'll ever have. I don't care for, or about anyone anymore. I will make my experience one to enjoy, fitting my personal wishes.

1in3xi,"Last Saturday my dad got on my computer when I wasn't home and unfortunately I did not clear my history as I normally do.  It wasn't some kind of crazy gay porno or anything. It was just some messages to a friend and some posts I made on social media. 

I've known I was this way for a while but I never could let my parents know...or any of my super religious family for that matter. They lost it when they found out. Mom cried. Dad yelled. I was thrown out on the street despite the fact that I told them I have no where to go. Absolutely no where. I stayed two nights with a friend of mine but it's not something I'll be able to keep up since his parents will be home in a few days. (They were on vacation and he lives with them.) Since then (Monday night up until this point) I've been sleeping in my car in a parking garage. I have no food whatsoever. I have no gas whatsoever. I can't believe my parents just wrote me off like this. 

I even tried to call my mom on Tuesday hoping it had been enough time to calm everything down. I asked her if I could at least come have dinner or something and they said no because ""my dad doesn't want to sit across the table from a faggot.""

I'm just so hurt and I'm somewhat ashamed of the fact that I'm attracted to other guys. I guess it's because I've been brought up being told it was wrong. 

I really don't know what to do or think. I can't understand how parents not only kick their kid to the street with only 30 minutes notice. They won't let me come back and told me they'd mail me my clothes but everything else was technically theirs because they either bought it or supported me which took money out of their pockets so essentially they believe even the things I purchased are theirs. (Computer, guitar, dog, etc.) They won't even give me a meal or answer their phones for me. I just don't understand how they're perfectly fine with their only child going hungry and sleeping in a parking garage. 

I don't have many friends but now I feel even more alone. My family was the only social communication I really had and now my cousins aren't even allowed to talk to me (They're under 18.) Not only do I see no way of fixing the situation, I'm not sure I want to. My parents are obviously horrible people but that's all I had. ",1
16d25h,"I've had a pretty hard life, and it's only gotten worse within the last few years. I've always struggled with depression, and contemplated suicide, and even took some pills as a teenager, but never gave it any sort of serious attempt. 

A few months ago my normal dark place got even darker. Everything in my life seemed (and still seems) like shit. I'd been thinking about suicide every single day, and I had been researching the methods. I finally decided what I was going to do and I went out and bought some helium tanks, some plastic tubing, and an oven roasting bag. I bought all the things needed to deliver my death. I would be unconscious within 30 seconds and dead in 20 minutes. Now I never wanted to feel like this was a decision I made in haste, so I left the supplies in the back of my car. I wanted to know the option was still right there, but I didn't want it close enough to taunt me on a late night where I knew all I had to do was slip a bag over my head and be done with it all. 

There were a lot of times I thought about going out and getting it over with. I thought about renting a nice hotel room so the last things I'd hear would be the crashing of waves on the pacific shore. Other times I thought about just driving to a remote parking lot and doing it in the car. I'd be far enough away to be undisturbed, but close enough to be discovered in a somewhat timely matter. 

Today, in a disturbingly calm manner, I finally decided to bring the supplies in and get everything assembled, so that when the time came I wouldn't have to fuss with much. So, I went out to my car, and started carrying in the items. On my dining room table sat my DIY suicide kit. Pictures of balloons and words about children's birthday parties adorned the side of the boxes. Most people who bought these were looking forward to celebrating another year of life, and I bought them with the intent to do just the opposite. 

For some reason, as I pulled the tubing from the Home Depot bag, I couldn't help but think this was just not right. Something about being so calm and collected while doing this just made me pause. I looked at my receipt. It was beyond the 30 days allowed for in the policy, but I wondered if I could get my money back. It was this one thought that made me decide that what I was planning to do wasn't right for me, at least for now. The fact that I thought about getting my money back. Something like that doesn't matter in death, so why was I concerned about it?

Right then, I said to myself, ""I need to find it in myself to give this one more shot."" I called the store I purchased my helium from and told them I had a couple of sealed boxes which I ended up not needing, and asked if they would make an exception and allow me to return them beyond their date. They said, ""No problem."" I was allowed to change my mind. Now I can't say how long this will last. Something terrible may happen to me tonight and tomorrow I may be buying those tanks again, but I know that I at least have given myself another day.

I just wanted to post this as maybe it would make someone else think, ""I'm going to give it one more shot.""",1

You can absolutely disagree with everything I write in this post, or you can agree with it. Either way, writing out how I feel makes me feel better.

__________________________________________


I've had depression for a really long time.
When I say ""a really long time"", I mean since I was at least 12 or 13. My doctor refused to diagnose it at that time and blamed my feelings on ""hormonal changes"".
I have a much better doctor now.


My family life as a kid was not the best. I hated my dad because he was constantly cheating on my mom and was mentally, emotionally and physically abusive.


My mom had no one else but me, so guess who became her shoulder to lean on when times were tough? Her child. Me.


I was bullied as a kid. I was bullied because I didn't wear fancy clothes (my family shopped at thrift stores), and I didn't have big boobs. I was a late bloomer. I am fairly sure I smelled bad, too, because we couldn't afford to do laundry regularly and I didn't shower as often as I should have.


My family also moved alot, so I was always the ""new kid"".


I started working at the age of 13. I dealt with a lot of sexual harassment from the older men at my work. I worked the deli at a small grocery/bulk food store. If it wasn't the factory guys telling me what positions they wanted to see me in (if they could only get me alone, of course), it was the evening manager and his buddy placing pairs of round fruit on the deli table and asking which size I preferred best. Those sick fucks both had daughters under the age of 5. I bet they would have murdered someone for talking to their kid this way, yet here they were. They knew my age.
A few times I WAS caught alone in places where cameras couldn't reach, I was groped and solicited for sexual acts. Shouting out, ""FUCK OFF YOU SICK FUCK"" usually worked well enough. No one ever wants to get *caught* being a sick fuck with a minor.


I kept working because I was helping my parents pay for rent. Eventually, I left and got a job at a McDonald's that opened near my home. At least there I only had to deal with sexual harassment from guys my own age. It was mostly ass slapping. The occasional breast grab (what little breast I had, anyway). That stopped after I started giving it back. The guys didn't like it when I pointed out that they had their own breasts they could fondle. They also didn't like it when I said that in front of their parents.


At 14, I met the man I would later marry. We were good friends for two years. We started dating at 16 (he's the same age as me). We had our first child at 18. Our second child came along when we turned 21. We're still together after 11 1/2 years. Yeah, we fight a lot, but the fights usually start because I become irrationally angry when I go through depressive phases. I shut him out and try to find reasons for him to leave me.


I take meds. I often forget to take them, so I go through the withdrawal a lot. I've now been med-free for a month because I got tired of forgetting, spiralling, then being fine for a while until I forgot again.


I am a student. I'm studying to enter a career in health sciences. I love helping people, and I feel like it has a lot to do with the fact that I feel like I can't help myself.


I work. I don't usually have trouble getting a job. I work hard, I've got a great personality, I interview really well because I know what answers people are looking for in interviews...I'm an ideal employee, overall. I've been in this current job for the past year and a half. I love my job, even when I hate it (it's a managerial position, so I deal with a lot of stupid shit). People look to me for leadership. People consider me their source of a ""final say"" in most situations. People respect me and speak highly of me.


Yet, despite all of the above.....last night, I wanted to end my life.


I see a lot of posts on this sub from people who are depressed and look at how they have no relationship or job.

As weird as this is going to sound: be grateful. You have time to focus on your needs. You have time to determine who you are and who you want to be before you bring someone else into your world.


I have everything going for me, and I'm still depressed. It didn't get better because I entered a relationship or got a job. It got worse. There is more pressure to be....well, to be *NOT* depressed. There's more pressure to keep living, even when you feel like staying in bed for a week.
There's pressure to remain constant.
If I am having a day where, internally, I am hating myself and contemplating death, I can't let others see that. They start asking, ""are you okay? You look down. Is everything okay?"" And you can't explain, ""oh, I just feel like dying. No big deal.""
That's not socially acceptable. People don't know how to handle suicidal people. Most people lack the capacity to comprehend what it is to be depressed and are not equipped to deal with it.

So, you learn to fake it until you make it. You smile through the pain, blink back the tears, and pretend everything is okay so people don't ask too many questions.


I'm technically considered attractive, I guess. I've gained a bunch of weight in the past year, though, so I have gone from being stared at like a piece of meat to being looked at as, ""well.....your hotter, younger friend wouldn't fuck me. I guess you'll do.""
Being attractive does not make life better. I mean, that's probably hard to believe considering the typical ""dream"" is to be rich and hot. Being hot doesn't mean shit if you're still dying inside. Being an attractive female just means you don't need to worry as much about having a brain because people will still want to have sex with you.


I have a man who loves me and would probably do just about anything for me, if I asked. I told him I wasn't coming home last night. He went out and looked for me before I even confirmed I was planning to die.
He had no idea where to start, but he couldn't just sit by and wait.


I have two children. What would they think/say/feel if I died? Last night, I didn't care enough to consider that.
They're both under 10 years and think I'm the greatest thing since sliced bread and toaster ovens.
These little humans rely on me to teach them to be good humans when they're adults. I didn't even have the courtesy to think about how the loss of their mother could potentially devastate them as I contemplated dying last night.


When I get these suicidal thoughts, I only consider myself. MY needs. MY feelings. MY self-hatred. MY inadequacies.


I don't consider how my death could impact those who actually DO care about me.


I have friends who won't contact me for months, but then reach out randomly to hang out. I act like it's all their fault and that they're ignoring me. Do I not have a phone and two hands to contact them??
Relationships are a two way street. Just like they're not contacting me, I'm not exactly contacting them.


I have friends who contact me almost daily. I ignore them, then get mad when they get tired of being ignored and then later ignore me.


It's easy for me to point out all of these things right now because I made it to see the morning. Ive had plenty of time to think and reflect. Last night? Well....that's a different story.


I've tried to kill myself far too many times to count. Various methods have been attempted. I always change my mind last minute or someone stops me. Once, and only once, did I get sent to the hospital. The recovery period was very unpleasant. You're on constant watch, and hospital staff are not as subtle when they know you're suicidal. They get really in your face and don't leave you alone, even though all you want is to be alone.


It's ironic, really. I wanted to be alone because I was tired of feeling alone.


A lot of people reading this are going to be like, ""you don't know my pain. You have people who care about you. You're loved. Wtf are you sad about?""


Well, maybe the same can be said about you. You don't know my pain or what I've experienced in life. Only what I've shared here. You have people who care about you, but you push them away because you can't see past your own perspective. You're loved, but you just don't allow yourself to be loved.
I know because that was me. It is me. It will probably always be the way I am.


I almost didn't make it to see this morning.


There will be other mornings like this, where I reflect on how I almost ended my life the night before.


In the end, it's up to me to decide if I'm going to keep wallowing in self-hatred or if I'm going to wake up to a new day and try to keep living.


The moral of the story: I know what life will bring. I have so much control over how my life turns out. I have no idea what happens when we die, and I have no control once I'm dead. That, in itself, is much scarier to me than trying to navigate a life where I constantly hate myself.
I think that's why I always back out of every suicide attempt....because I'm more afraid of death.


*I woke up this morning. I hope you did, too.*",1
6h9xti,"Hello, world.

The year is 2017, the month June, and it’s the 13th. A prime number, the 6th prime number to be precise. I smell cigarette smoke; it’s probably the girl next door. I smoke too, but I hate cigarettes; the smell, the burning sensation it leaves in your mouth, and the worst, the inability to smell, or taste properly. I smoke because my friends do. I smoke to belong. Lame excuse.

Although, when it comes to marijuana it’s a completely different story. Not that I love the smoke or the smell; but they’re more bearable, and the effect justifies all its downsides. People smoke weed for a ton of reasons, each very different from one another. My reason? It helps me sleep. It helps me wake up, not tired, but the way that flowers wake up in the morning. It helps me prepare for the day the way the flowers prepare for the sun. Hail Mary.

According to the medical department, I have ADHD. I can’t focus properly; maybe I don’t want to. I used to be better; you know the kid that aced every test without even studying? Yeah that was me. Then something happened, life happened. You see, life tests us; every one of us, each in their own way. It demands us to change the way we look at things, the way we react to things, the way we judge. It demands us to bend. You know what happens to what doesn’t bend. Maybe the things I’ve seen and heard were too much for me; maybe I was too weak.

I had dreams; I wanted be a scientist, and astrophysicist to be exact. That was when I was about six. I still remember reading about Kaoru Ikeya and dreaming of being like him. When I was around ten, I wanted to be a writer, to write like Charles Dodgeson did, to express the world like Maxim Gorky did. By the time I turned twelve, I’d already been fed up with the world we live in. I wanted to be a magician, not like the ones you’d see in Hogwarts, Ilvermorny, or Brakebills, but like Edgar Cayce. I’m not sure magic is the correct word, it feels correct enough. When I was fourteen, I’m not ashamed to say that all I did was just watching porn, jerking off to women multiple times my age.

When I turned sixteen I’d become quite good with computers, and I’ve started to become a full time employee at Internet, inc. I’ve been true to the Rules of the Internet ever since, especially the rules 1, 2, 12, 14, 20, and 37. The next two years were a rollercoaster which the highs and lows didn’t really justify the dull mids. This is around when I’ve started to completely disregard any need to pay attention at school. Maybe I couldn’t, I didn’t want to, or I read the Manifesto too much. To sum it up, I’ve had dreams of getting into the empire business like Mr. White did, to try and burn the parliament building like Guy Fawkes did, to go into the wild like Chris McCandless did, to go on an adventure like Jules Verne did, and to become a composer like Mozart did, in the last two years.

I miss when I was six. Ignorance truly is bliss.

I’ve left out so many things, because to write them would take a lifetime, a lifetime I do not have. Forgive me for not telling you about the happy moments with my friends when I was little, or the mesmerizing worlds I flew into in my books, or the stories of when we were too broke to pay my school fees. All those moments, the happy ones and the sad ones brought me to the point I am right now, they’ve made me who I am now, and in one way or another they have influenced my next and final reaction.

By now you should’ve already guessed what kind of a letter this is, yes, it’s a suicide letter, my suicide letter. I didn’t record thirteen tapes because I don’t blame anyone for anything. I’ve had my share of this beautiful and rotten world. I’m grateful to every person who ever praised me, or criticized me. When I look back, all I can say is that I’ve lived a life one can be proud of; and I am.

It feels much better now I’ve told at least some of it to someone, to everyone. You might forget me when you click the next link, you might disregard everything I’ve written as hippie bullshit, after all, I’m just one of eight billion; what difference could I ever make to a soul that didn’t break when life itself couldn’t.

I’d like you to know that I liked to drink orange juice; Asleep by The Smiths, and Lacrimosa filled my ears when I couldn’t bear the noise; I re-read The Book Thief and The Perks of Being a Wallflower a million times; and that I had the best friends one could ever hope for.

One little request before I leave, please don’t kill the earth. Try to see the destruction we’ve caused in the little time we’ve been here. Wouldn’t it be wiser to save what we already have than to send rovers for more?

And I believe you’ll forgive me for quoting John Green, It’s the most beautiful thing I’ve ever read and I think you should have it. It’s my gift to you.

> “I wanted so badly to lie down next to her on the couch, to wrap my arms around her and sleep. Not fuck, like in those movies. Not even have sex. Just sleep together in the most innocent sense of the phrase. But I lacked the courage and she had a boyfriend and I was gawky and she was gorgeous and I was hopelessly boring and she was endlessly fascinating. So I walked back to my room and collapsed on the bottom bunk, thinking that if people were rain, I was drizzle and she was hurricane.” - John Green, Looking for Alaska",1
25igd7,"The ""It Gets Better"" catchphrase comes out of [The Trevor Project](http://www.thetrevorproject.org/), and we have nothing but respect and support for them. But the ""It Gets Better"" campaign has an extremely specific target audience: school-age LGBT youth who are at risk for suicide because of bullying and harassment. The campaign was intended to assure them that *this particular type of experience* does get better as they get older and their peer group becomes more mature.

Unfortunately, ""It Gets Better"" has become associated with suicide prevention in general. This phrase, or any phrase with a similar meaning, is a dangerous way to try and support someone at risk. **When someone is struggling with despair, it's a bad idea to make promises to them on behalf of the Universe.** If the Universe doesn't happen to keep those promises, the results can be tragic.

We can never know what lies ahead for anyone, not even ourselves. Despite that, we tell each other what will happen all the time, and when we're calm and rational we know how to take it when a friend says ""everything will be okay"". We know that our friends can't actually predict or control the future. But people at high risk for suicide are often in a mental state called ""cognitive constriction"", and in that state they don't have the perspective to handle an ""it gets better"" message realistically.  

We're not saying this *never* works - we know there are plenty of cases when it does.  But it also backfires, usually in one of two ways.  Sometimes they pin all their hopes on the ""promise"", which can lead to disaster in the future *even if they respond positively in the moment*.  Sometimes they can't believe it, and they see their inability to believe it as evidence of their own personal failure, which can lead to disaster right away. 

Some other examples of other equally bad messages, all of which make promises that the Universe may not keep, copypasted from actual recent (all made within 8 hours of writing this post) well-meaning comments in SW:

 *   Set a goal. It's a lot of work, it's a long process but it will be worth it...
 *   I'm sure he's up for supporting you.
 *   It's a really good idea, I promise.
 *   Speaking to a therapist or counselor will make sure that you get the help you want.
 *   Trust me when I say you will learn to handle all that other stuff...
 *   Make the decision to walk somewhere and back, to read a book, to watch a movie. It helps, I promise.
 *   You shall be happy again and again.

Some of you may be wondering how you can be supportive without saying stuff like this. Well, support is not about ""giving hope"". It's about nurturing resilience, so that our OPs can better handle whatever life throws at them next. And we nurture resilience by:

1.  Avoiding outcome-based thinking, which is a guaranteed recipe for misery, [as Srikumar Rao explains far better than we could](http://www.ted.com/talks/srikumar_rao_plug_into_your_hard_wired_happiness).

2.  Helping people feel less alone in whatever dark place they're in. The most volatile critical risk factor for death by suicide is a sense of alienation, and the medicine for that is empathy, not ""positivity"". If you're not clear on the subtle but vital difference between empathy and encouragement, [this very short animated excerpt from Brené Brown's RSA talk covers it with great charm and efficiency](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Evwgu369Jwy).

So, we have a new rule, 4d: Please, **never make promises to our vulnerable OPs that you personally can't keep**.  This means ***not*** saying ""it gets better"" or predicting any future outcomes!

We'd like to express our immense gratitude to all our vigilant community members who have been busily reporting posts of this nature and politely and constructively calling out people who mean well but don't realize that their approach isn't the best.  We appreciate your efforts, and we hope the information in this post and the new guideline, which links back to this post, will make everyone's life a little easier.  

Please give us your thoughts on this issue - especially your suggestions for refining our policies and guidelines!

I'm worried that nobody will celebrate my birthday, and that nobody will celebrate my life. What am I without my friends? 

I would not be anything.

Please help me. I don't want to be forgotten. I am terrified. 

I'm in so much pain.",1

I had very little recollection of these events, but I would wake up with bruises and pain in my head. The fifth day, I walked out to my stairs and tumbled down 2 flights of steps, sustaining severe brain damage all over my head. Due to improper medical care, I was sent home and for the next 5 days I continued bashing up my already injured head in my sleep, till the point of internal bleeding. And then its suddenly gone, no more weird occurences have happened since that week.

Now i struggle to type coherently, and all my senses are completely fucked up. I have very little memory of the past and can't hold memories for more than 5 seconds. I feel like I'm half drunk all the time and in an instant, I have become a low-functioning individual.

Just 2 months ago I was receiving awards on my research papers, being complimented for being a very bright mind, and now, I have lost it all.

I am not even able to watch TV because my mind processes the information too slowly and it overwhelms me to the point of nausea. I also find it hard to listen to music as it overwhelms my senses. This is coming from a guy who used to play 5 instruments and gotten accolades and awards in musician competitions.

This is fucked up beyond belief. I had everything, I cherished it so much. I fought so hard to be successful. Now I have nothing.

I cannot live like this...",1

khqx0,"My brother killed himself a year ago.  We were very close, and it has been unbearably hard on me, my family, and countless friends.  I wanted to come here and tell my side of the story.  And tell the brutal truth, not just the emotions felt.  I want those who feel alone or loved to know what it is like for us who are left behind, not as a way of laying on guilt or belittling your feelings, but so you know what life is like after you are gone.  I will give a small backstory of His life as a jumping off point, but mainly I am focusing on my story.  

He was 32.  He had Bipolar Disorder, which didn't fully manifest until his last 3-4 years of life. He did try twice before to kill himself.  The first we didn't know about, and he was thankful to be ""saved"" by a stranger.  The second was serious, but he came to in the middle of it and realized it wasn't what he wanted.  He crawled to a phone and called 911 himself.  He was a grown adult, he lived 4 hours away from the family, and he did not want us treating him like a baby.  Standing over his shoulder and jumping at every inconsistency in his life not only felt wrong (though unavoidable), but I know it only made him feel worse and fed his depression.  So I tried to back off and give him some room to make mistakes like a normal person......  

I noticed his lack of presence about 3 days before his birthday.  No one else had mentioned it, so I tried to remain calm (it had happened before, and he had been ok).  He had been struggling very hard with money, and I thought maybe he had shut his internet service off.  I decided to wait to call.  I figured if I hadn't heard concerns from anyone else, I would wait until his birthday, because I had planned on calling him then anyway.  So his birthday rolls around, and when I try to call he didn't answer.  I knew this would happen, and the feeling of dread rose worse in my stomach.  Then his ""girlfriend"" sent me a message, asking if I had heard from him.  She hadn't since nearly a week before.  I knew then what I knew 3 days earlier, but I tried to keep up hope.  I started contacting people I knew who lived around him, asking anyone if they had seen/spoken to him or if they could go check on him.  No one could till the next morning.  At 7:45am, I received a phone call that I never, ever wanted.  A neighbor went over and found him.  I still don't know exactly what happened, because according to our mutual friend, the neighbor and his SO have not been the same since.  They stopped talking to anyone familiar with Him.  The man even ignored my mother when she tried to introduce herself and apologize for what he had gone through.  My mutual friend was given the horrible weight of having to call and tell me.  I can't imagine how difficult that must have been.  Being 4 hours away from each other, all he could say was ""I'm so sorry"" over and over.  I cried harder than I have ever cried in my life.  I then had to call my other brother and let him know.  Then me, my husband and 4 yr old, my 
brother and his wife, and my mom's SO had the displeasure of going to Mom's home and letting her know.  She was completely unaware that He had been ""missing"" for nearly a week.  We woke her from her sleep, and I watched as her surprise of seeing me grew to uncomfortable worry as each new person came into the house.  The horror in her body language as she slowly realized what was going on was heartbreaking.  We never even had to say anything.  Parents should never have to bury their children.  They especially shouldn't have to know that their beloved child had been so lost and miserable that they felt the need to end their own suffering.  What an utterly helpless feeling.  I watched a good person be reduced to nothing, full with the feelings of failure.  

Skip past the full day of crying and the haze of disbelief  as we made endless calls to hospitals, police stations, morgues, funeral homes, etc.  Skip past being told that the body had been there for an undetermined amount of time and had started decomposing.  Skip past being told that the body was unidentifiable and the forensic investigator was waiting for dental records to make a positive ID.  Skip past being told that, ""There isn't anything left that you could identify.  And even if there were, I would never let you.  You don't need to see this.""  Skip past knowing that there was no chance to ever see him again, even just to hold his hand and say goodbye.  

The next day we made the 4 hour trip to his house.  I rode with a bottle of Pepto in my hand and a never-ending feeling of complete nausea in my stomach.  I had the tiniest bit of hope because no one had yet mentioned the thing I feared.  I figured it would have come up in all the talks.  We were the last to get there, and once out of the car, Mom asked me, ""Are you ready?""  I truthfully answered, ""No.""  Then she said it.  What I was more worried about than finding anything.  She said, ""Now, they said it smells pretty bad in there.""  OH. GOD.  I had held it together as well as possible during the ride, but that..... I didn't want that.  I broke down instantly.  I ran to my mom's arms and sobbed uncontrollably.  Your sense of smell is the strongest in being tied to memories, and I didn't want to have to experience walking into my brother's house and smelling his dead, rotting body.  No.  But too late, there was nothing to do about it.  The smell was everywhere.  The entire house was filled with the aroma of death.  It wasn't quite what I thought it would be.  It was like a mouse that has died somewhere in the corner of your house, but not quite.  It was both better and worse than I was expecting.  Better because it wasn't as pungant and sickly as I thought it would be, but worse because of the uniqueness of it.  I never got to see the spot where he died.  Not fully.  Mom and my brother walked back ahead of us as I slowly meandered the house, remembering him.  Seeing his house untouched made it seem like he wasn't really gone, just out.  In the room, Mom was just staring as people tried to get her out, and my husband shielded me from going in.  He told me that I didn't want to see it and didn't need to.  I wanted to, but it's probably better that I didn't I guess.  

Fast forward to the next day.  We came back with supplies in hand, and this time armed with menthol rub for our noses.  I don't have to mention the regular milling around, not knowing where to start on cleaning up and looking at all the things that reminded us of Him.  But on this day, I experienced the most surreal moment of my life.  By the time my husband and I got there, my mom and her SO were in the process of cutting out the carpet where he had lay.  I only saw the underside of it.  But even at that, I saw the large circle of blood that had soaked through.  Apparently there were maggots covering the top.  Everything had seaped through the carpet and padding and onto the concrete below.  They took the carpet outside to air out and to help with removing the smell.  Then my mom got a bucket and sponge to scrub the floor.  I told her she didn't need to do it, to let me clean up.  But she wouldn't let me.  So I sat on his bed and watched.  Looking down at my mom, on her hands and knees scrubbing up the blood of my dead brother, I felt removed from the situation.  In all honesty, it felt like watching a crime drama on TV.  It was the sort of thing I had seen on TV and in movies many times before, but it wasn't what happens in real life.  People don't experience that in real life, so it couldn't be real.  At one point, she said to me, ""I think I know why I am ok with doing this.""  After I asked her why, she replied, ""He was my baby.  When he was little I cleaned his diapers.  I took care of him and cleaned up after him if he got sick and threw up.  This is just one more thing I am cleaning up.  He was sick, and I am helping him by cleaning up the mess.""  It was heartwrenching, both grotesquely melancholy and beautifully rational.  (As a side note, there are companies that specifically do this sort of work.  Everyone failed to tell us this, and we didn't find out until after we were done.)  

But here is what I really want people to know.  After we found out and settled some, I made an announcement about it on-line.  I was blown away by the response that followed.  Countless people, probably 100 or more in just a day or two, poured in with messages and comments.  Some were your run-of-the-mill sympathy.  A sort of, ""Oh hey, I knew that guy in school.  He was pretty cool.  That's sad.""  But some, most actually, were truly devestated.  So many people wrote to Him or me, pouring their hearts out.  SO MANY PEOPLE LOVED HIM.  He had no idea the affect his death would have on others.  Friends and family, some who I knew, some who I didn't, completely heartbroken over finding out.  A number of people wrote to tell me how He had been the person who got them through their own tough times.  He had saved so many of his friends and had offered an ear or a voice to them.  I don't think he ever knew how much people cared about him.  People from all aspects and ages of his life.  He thought he was alone, and nothing could have been further from the truth.  I have never in my life seen such a reaction to someone's death.  It's been a year now, and his acct is still active with thoughts of love and remorse.  Not a week goes by that someone hasn't written to him, just to say they are thinking of him or how there is still a light missing from their lives.  So many messages of people saying, ""I wish I would have returned your call,""  or ""I wish I had known how to help you better.""  He had so many people to turn to for help, had he just tried.

5mw4df,"About a year ago, i Asked for help from this subreddit, cause I was rather depressed, stuck living in a house with my abusive mother and stepfather, afraid that i was going to turn out like drug addicts like them and was genuinely considering suicide. But i decided not to take my own life with the help from a few people here and a close friend. Its been about a year since then, and with alot of support from alot of people, i moved out about 9 months ago, ive continued my studies and even started learning to drive (something that genuinely frightened me and never dreamed of being able to do), as well as a few minor acheivements. Ive come a long way, and i owe alot of it to this server. I appreciate you all. Life can get better.",1
