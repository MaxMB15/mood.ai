If you have concerns or questions about the community policies, this is a good place to raise those as well. This time I want to share some points about helping OPs who may be at risk for suicide.   Although we understand that depression and suicidality are distinct issues and we encourage people whose main issue is suicidal thoughts and feelings to post at /r/SuicideWatch, we don't feel that any kind of ""you should post there, not here"" message could conceivably be helpful to a person in great distress.  However, the information in [the SW sidebar](/r/SuicideWatch/about/sidebar) may be of help to anyone trying to support someone struggling with thoughts of suicide.  We link the two most important posts for helpers, the talking tips and risk assessment guide, from the sidebar here, but there's a lot more there.   Almost nobody posts about their suicidal thoughts on reddit because they don't know that hotlines exist.  Just providing a hotline number without finding out how the person might feel about that option can make the person feel invalidated.  Also, if it does make sense to suggest a hotline in a particular case, don't just assume a person's in the US. Imagine the how it would feel for a US redditor to be told ""just call 116 123, that'll work everywhere"" meaning everywhere in the European Union. There's a global directory in the /r/SuicideWatch sidebar, which is also linked here, and that's the best link to offer someone whose location you don't know.   Remember that anonymity is a safety device in suicide intervention that saves far more lives than it costs.  The situations where breaching someone's confidentiality is the best option are the outliers, like when someone is strangled by a safety harness. Plus, we almost never have enough risk assessment information to justify outing someone (which has to go through reddit's admins and their legal team) and subjecting them to a traumatic, invasive, involuntary intervention, which may discourage them from opening up about their feelings in future.   If you do feel that a post needs attention from the mod team for any reason, including high risk of harm, please take a few extra seconds to send us a modmail rather than clicking ""report"".  The linkage between reports and spam is hardcoded into reddit's DNA, so clicking ""report"" on a post increases the risk that the post will be snagged by the sitewide filter, which we have no control over.   Keep in mind that the most reliable way to de-escalate someone is to give them the experience of feeling understood.  A strong interpersonal connection is usually enough to reduce immediate risk of suicide. That's one of the many reasons why [this little empathy video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Evwgu369Jw) is always linked from our sidebar. ","1"

"Jesus. How do I even start. All of this is so obvious and yet for years I haven't been able to grasp what's been happening with me in the past 12 years (I'm now 22).I'll start with the context. I've been dealing with depressive thoughts and anxiety for a period of about 5 years now and haven't been able to pinpoint the exact reasons for why I felt about myself the way I did (yeah, the imfamous ""brain fog"").I managed to finish school with ""good enough"" grades and enroll at a nice university. I have been an alright student for the most part and been successful with all the exams/challenges that came my way. But in late 2015 (the last year of my bachelors programme) I started noticing that I was not actually satisfied with my education, in fact - I didn't even like most of the courses. That dissatisfaction had lead to me questioning whether or not I should continue the chosen academic path and whether a master's degree in that specialization was worth investing an additional 2 years into or not. At that time I thought to myself: ""Of course I should go on with my education, it's a no brainer!"". Well, things started getting really bad this year when the time for my dissertation to be written has finaly come. Oh, how much was I procrastinating while having no coherent idea of the subject for my thesis... This struggle made me wonder why it's so difficult for me to come up with good ideas and that's exactly when the revelation came.FAKE. Faking. I've been faking everything since age 11. My middle school education, my interest in university courses, ""friends"". Everything was fake.I'm yet to fully grasp all the details and circumstances of the moment I turned from being a clever, curios and inquisitive boy to someone who felt the need to fake everything. But I know for a fact that it all happened when I stopped hanging out with well-behaved kids and made friends with a kid who acted like a hooligan all the time. Oh well...It's kind of shameful to arrive at such conclusion when I'm a 22-year old guy but I guess better late than never. The new road is ahead of me and I'm both scared and intrigued...","1"

Someone I can talk to about the simplest things, laugh with and cry with. I have no passion. No motivation. But I do want to change. I want to be loved and I want to be needed by someone. Its hard when youve got nobody because you will never get invited places. Everyone around me has their life sorted already and they dont need a new friend.

"It's been over two and a half years since you last said you loved me. It's been just over two years since you last spoke to me. I've moved, changed jobs, travelled the country, made new friends, climbed mountains, had experiences I could once have only dreamed. Yet try as I might, I can't get you to leave me. A day, an afternoon, many times an hour can't go past without me thinking of you. Longing for you, your love, your companionship, your friendship. And that truly is what I miss most of all; I miss my best friend. You were everything I ever wanted in life, angel. Unfortunately for me, you still are. And knowing you will never even give me the time of day again is slowly killing me. It's a slower death than I first thought it'd be, I admit. I'm still here, after all. But I don't want to be. It's been so long since I've wanted to be alive I'm not really entirely sure I know what that feeling is like anymore. I'd trade everything for just an acknowledgement of my existence by you at this point. Everything I've done the last six or seven years or so has been for you, angel, that way somebody truly in love just exists. I wish I could turn that off. To move on. To stop loving a woman who will never love me. But it turns out, my thrive damned loyalty has a lot of experience staying loyal when things suck. Even when I don't want to. In all those terrible fanfics we love(d?) to read, eventually that loyalty would pay off and we'd get our happy ending. In reality, my love for you is a ghost that haunts my every step, reminding me every minute of every day at how close I came to nirvana. Of how of all people I was going to get my happily ever after. That we were going to be one of the lucky ones. How naive. All I want for Christmas is still you, angel. And it always will be. Whether I want it to be or not. I love you. ","1"

"Well, probably it isnt first one,but first official one. Had no idea what was going on, whole body started to shake, hand and head felt numb, called ambulance and went to the hospital. Spent night there was feeling well, doctors told me to go check heart later. Got home and it started again but i learnt how to control it.Almost week later after that, i feel really strange. It feels like i'm in a dream. Everything is boring, i can't even play my fav games as i just dont focus to them. I feel like i'm still sleeping, i also feel empty. I hope someone else felt like this before and could help me. I don't know if everything is like this because i have depression. I don't know if i do. Feels like it. But before when i was sad i could play,read books or such and feel better. Now i'm afraid to get out of my bed because it might start again. And it happens even if i'm in bed, yesterday before sleep my right arm started shaking randomly and i couldn't control it.  So, is it possible that my fear is somehow connected to depression and vice versa? Should i go to doctors again? (Was at heart doctors yesterday, said i'm fine,nerves doctor also said i'm fine). Should i go to psycho-something(lol) for the first time? I really don't know what to do anymore. Don't want to tell more about this to my parents as they would be afraid, don't want to write about this to my friend either:I Sorry for my bad english, hard to think about grammar when i'm feeling like this, and i'm also very sorry if this is wrong sub for this.

"Hi everyone. First time poster. Trying not to internalize my emotions so much, and honestly, I need someone to listen.I've been diagnosed with depression since I was 13, and now that I'm 22 it's just gotten so much harder to handle. Normally I can handle myself and still stay productive, but over the last two years I've felt my grip on myself start to slip.For the past 3 days, it's been worse than it's been in years. I can't even talk to anybody I know about it because they don't understand what it's like. ""Just do something fun that'll make you happy"" and ""You need religion"" were two of the responses I've gotten so far when I try to reach out.I had a friend who understood, someone who has experienced it for himself, but last night I lashed out and now I think it's over between us. Whenever I get really depressed, I don't know how to handle myself. I can't afford meds or a therapist with my work and insurance now and I'm just really scared.Last night, for the first time since I was in high school, I seriously considered suicide. I managed to convince myself that I only had friends because they pitied me, and my family only kept in contact because they feel guilty. For the first time in a long time, I felt completely alone.Don't get me wrong. I enjoy life and all it has to offer, but last night, a switch was flipped and now all I can think of is the pros and cons of offing myself so I'm no longer on this crazy ride. Again, I really don't want to, but the thoughts are like thunder in my head.I must not be the only one who's been in this situation.

Being with family, movies, games, writing, music, going out, working out, etc. But, my depression is vampiric in the way that it sucks the enjoyment out of everything. One by one each have become joyless and chore like.  It feels as though depression finally won. It has consumed me. Broken me. And the worst part of it all is knowing that I'll always have this. I've never wanted to give up more.It has gotten to the point where all that is on my mind is suicidal thoughts and bullying myself. If I could just have one escape back it would be great. Even just being able to sit down to enjoy a video game instead of forcing myself to. I just want to escape the thinking. Just for a bit.","1"

"I was having a chat with my friend whos off in university yesterday and I talking about humanity as a topic. Hows were all truly selfish and how compassion is just a lie. Where in reality we all do these actions to make ourselves feel better. To boost our ego and to just make feel like were someone better. Just if your comforting someone whos crying and youre comforting them out of pity so that you can make yourself feel better you know? He said, that my views on humanity are dangerous and thats hes concerned for my mental health now. He says that its getting worse. I said that I dont trust everyone except a select few (3-4 people) not even my parents or my relatives. Cause I dont trust people until they reveal their true intentions, colours etc. After I said this, he got very concerned.  Hes asking me to see the real world. But I see the real world for as it is. Hes saying Im not and instead of looking at rose-coloured glasses Im looking at the world with Dark-Black coloured glasses.  Afterwards I asked him why, and he said that hes afraid Ill kill myself because of these thoughts or think so little of human life that I become a sociopath and kill someone. He remembers when I was a compassionate and caring, and how he says that Im hiding everything behind a black and negative curtain. How Im losing myself and turning into a very dark and cynical person. Theyre right I guess. My mental health and my own personality has been very dark and cynical lately. I dont like talking to anyone, like I used to. I consider everyone an annoyance. All the chores I do are just meaningless. Like right now I should be studying. But I dont want to. Like whats the point. I just want to forget everything. Not only that, I feel like Im running out of time. Of my own existence or how long Im gonna last. And judging from that sense, Im not gonna last that much longer if I keep going down this path. ","1"
"So maybe this post isn't all to the point in some places, but I just like to get things off my chest.I'm a guy in my mid-twenties and I've been living in a new city on my own for a couple of months now. I moved out of my parents' after I had my first full time job for a year or so. I've had periods of depression before, mainly due to feelings of loneliness and (social) anxiety. I don't have any close friends, because in the past I'd either feel fine being on my own or otherwise felt too anxious to go out and actually meet people. I was certain that living on my own would become more difficult in that regard, so I needed to do something to counteract a possible recurring depression. What I did was join a dance class in that city. I still take classes and go to social dance evenings regularly and I really enjoy it. It has also been a great boost in building self-confidence and I've become a bit less uptight around people. So this has been one of the best decisions I've made in life so far I'm certain.Another thing I did was join a martial arts class, to get more in shape and also to make friends of course.I sometimes attend a meetup. I've also been thinking about going out of the house more and work on my sketchbook in public places; since I enjoy drawing and might also meet people this way hehe. But aside from these things I don't much hang out with people outside of the classes and I feel lonely a lot. Yesterday I felt miserable to spend the night alone in my apartment.A couple of months ago I was travelling somewhere for a week and I met a lovely girl. We were both interested in drawing, it's actually her profession, and I think it clicked well between us. We spent a couple of days together there, and after separating we kept in touch through texts because we live quite far apart now. A while ago we talked about travel plans and she said she liked to meet again when I asked her, so now we're going to travel together again for about three weeks. :DSo that's going to happen and I'm very excited and happy about this. However, what makes me feel a little sad and sometimes bitter is that, when I hear what's she's doing or when I look her up on social media, it looks like she's having such an interesting life. She seems to have many good friends and her career allows her to travel a lot and meet so many interesting people. I know she's worked so hard for this and I think she has really earned it, but I can't help the feeling of inadequateness and sadness when I reflect back on my life right now.Maybe I'm just whining. Hope you guys are willing to give some advice on how to approach this. Thanks!","1"

"TL;DR:Depressed, anxious, shut in, lonely, heartbroken, suicidal, really need someone to speak to.Heya, I've posted here before which you can see on my profile, but nothing has stuck. Basically the same thing applies, but I really do now know how I can even make it through tonight feeling this empty and lonely. I don't start my anti-depressants until Thursday, and even then they can take weeks before they come into affect. I never speak up until I'm was past my limit, which is why it has taken me so many years to even see a doctor, which I did for the first time last Thursday but I was stupid and hesitated on the anti-depressants so now I must wait until Thursday. I have something for my anxiety but all it does is stop my body from shaking by slowing my heart or something, but does nothing to actually help the feeling. I'm still shut in and even struggling to go downstairs for food.I appreciate kind messages, but the amount of times I've heard the same stuff, it just feels so meaningless and empty. Hopefully I can find someone who understands, or even willing to just try and understand. I would prefer voice calling too, even though I get so scared of answering the phone etc, words on a screen are just so empty. It would be awkward to start with but I'm okay once I warm up to people a little bit.Again, with my stupid thoughts, I would appreciate it if you were female, I've never been able to speak to guys, I use to have one close guy friend but he moved away when we left school and I haven't spoken to him since. He was the only one who knew how I felt, with my self harm and suicidal thoughts. I'm sorry I have this mindset but I find it far easier to speak to someone who is female. I went through a really tough breakup in September too so love is not on my mind, I don't want to love or be loved in that way again.If you made it this far, I really appreciate it and I hope you have a lovely afternoon. I'm in the UK if that matters.","1"
"How do you even get help when you barely have the energy or will power to get out of bed? The idea of just finding a primary care doctor and/or therapist seems like Mount Everest let alone getting on a medication, going to therapy consistently and taking other steps to get better. I don't know what to do anymore. I hate being alive, but I have to go to work. I have to take care of my daughter. I have to be alive, but I'm not living. I'm existing and even that seems like a strong word to describe what I'm doing. Every day feels like I've reached my breaking point, but when you're this far gone, how does rock bottom even really help other than to make you feel more miserable because you have nothing left inside of you to climb out of rock bottom? Has anyone been here and made it out? Where do I start? I need a plan that is micro-baby steps at a time. Not only do I struggle with the depression and anxiety, but I have several chronic health problems that make everything that much harder. I don't know how to hope anymore.

"It basically translates to ""I don't really care about you but I'd feel bad if you killed yourself"".  I mean, ignore me the rest of the time and then once I'm actually feeling good, just make me feel like an inferior piece of shit.  Thanks a lot.  I'm a big boy now, I can sort myself out.I know the intentions are good, but I just managed to work my way out of a depressive episode - completely isolated - and tbh felt pretty good about having so much self control, something to prove to myself that I am managing to get better without anyone else's help.  That is probably the last thing I wanted to hear.  I would have preferred someone to tell me to kill myself, at least then you can tell them to fuck off and gain a little bit of determination to keep going.I can't get over just how shit that made me feel.  I mean, is that really all people think of me?  Yes I have my demons but you have no idea what I'm capable of.  Stop treating me like a fucking child.","1"
"Hey there! I've never actually posted a new thread on reddit before, but I think this is a topic that is most definitely worth giving the honour as my first post.I've been living with endogenic depression for a couple years now, I tried councilling and I found it way too difficult to open up to a stranger, so that didn't really work. I went to the doctors and was prescribed Sertraline. For a lot of people this drug does wonders, but for me it did not. Less than a week in I started to develop violent thoughts. After a couple weeks they were getting way too much to handle and I decided that they were not the answer for me.This made me feel hopeless, as you could imagine. I felt like this black hole which festers inside of me would never go away. About a week ago, my dad has suggested that I should try Valerian root tablets (500mg). I was very skeptical at first, I thought that if modern day pharmaceuticals did not work, then how could a plant? I know Valerian is usually used for Anxiety, but often enough anxiety and depression go hand in hand. Since I started taking them, I've woken up every morning feeling calm & composed. I haven't felt depressed now for about 4 days (unprecedented since I've falled prey to depressions foul grasp) and I haven't felt this good about myself for longer than I can remember.If anyone reading this can relate to anything I have wrote, I really do suggest you try it. I got 60 tablets from my local herbalist for 9 and I can honestly say you should give it a try. I don't know how much drugs like Sertraline cost in the US with your healthcare system, but if its more expensive than that, it may be worth exploring...If you're feeling like there are no more avenues to explore, don't give up hope just yet! You never know when a branch of hope will be extended, but it will come! If you've made it this far, then I really thank you for reading :)","1"

There really doesn't seem to be anywhere I can go to improve anymore.I went to college to get an associate's in Game Design, couldnt after one semester since my parents worked so hard against me to assist in financial aid that I still owe 23k for that semester. My own art isn't much better than it was before either; its pretty much stabalized at average-mediocre compared to other artists out there. And now Im just a supervisor for security at a museum barely scraping by for rent and other personal bills with a few roommates while still being unable to pay my student loan in any way shape or form.What I really detest is that I am aware I should get help, that maybe I just need proffesional guidance, possibly medication. But I cant seem to find any place around NYC that doesnt already cost whats basically an arm and a leg to me to be at and I can barely afford live paycheck to paycheck anyway. Just, once again reminding me that I cant even afford to keep my own life afloat, let alone attempt to improve it. I also know I can speak to my partner, but the problem is with her having own mental issues it can get in the way of me trying to explain my feelings; i.e. getting angry at me/feeling like I dont trust her and therefore not trusting me because I didnt tell her I was feeling a certain way asap, or uncontrollably crying because she feels inadequate for keeping me from feeling the way I do despite reassurance that this is just an effect of depression. So, I kind of keep it to myself really, and then have spikes and think ""wow I need help"", leading to thinking about how I cant afford it, then remembering that I'm in a spot that wil very likely not improve for a very long time.Honestly, I have every tool I need to just end it straight away but I'm fully aware of the impact it will have on my loved ones and how inconvenient itd be to those around me, so I continue to stick around.

The first time after we talked with her, she seemed to know not to do it again, though I think she was only more depressed thinking herself an idiot for doing it in the first place. However, a few days ago she had done it again and showed it to my other friend. This other friend told me and we both agreed the school counselor needed to be involved, as her parents supposedly previously dismissed her depression and refused to have her diagnosed. I assume her parents were immediately contacted as when I got back home, she had been threatening my other friend through a group chat, saying that now her parents knew, her life was ruined. Today, somehow she found out I was involved as well and has been spamming me angrily. Im scared to confront her on Monday, but I was prepared for that. What Im more scared of is the possibility that she may think because of this that her life has been ruined and that continuing cutting and even suicide is a good idea. Edit:I just want this to end.

"This is a pretty long and personal post so I appreciate everyone who reads this.Growing up I had a pretty rough childhood. I used to always get bullied by the other children because of how weak I was. I remember not getting past a day without crying till the 9th grade. Nobody really cared about me at school, everyone just thought of me as the class clown and someone to make fun of. Our financial condition is very poor so I never had all the new stuff that others had. Every passing day was hell for me but I somehow coped up with it.In 9th grade I started trying to be more extroverted. I met this girl who was in my class and we hit it off pretty well. I think at one point she even started to like me. But no matter what I would do I was still weak and pathetic. I was too much of a pussy to tell her that I loved her. Its been more than 3 years since I last talked to her and I still miss her to this day. I would leave away everything just to be with her.Because of this I have been single till now. I'm extremely introverted and haven't had a good conversation with any girl since then. The anxiety and depression also comes due to my poor financial condition. Where I live mostly everyone drives a bike whereas I walk around which just shoots my anxiety up. I'm too poor to even buy new clothes for myself. I've thought of working part time at some job but that's impossible due my college timings. Although I've started making efforts by freelance web designing they have been to no use. In two weeks I will be turning 19 and this is the most depressed and low I have been all my short life. I have officially hit rock bottom. This depression is resting on my heart for two reasons: Love and money. Every day goes on and I keep living like a lifeless zombie. I have no compassion left in life anymore. It's like I don't see the point in living. I would try and kill myself but I can never do that to my mom . She is the only person I care about as much as the girl I love. Even therapy is pointless because I live in a third world country and if I told everyone they would just tell me to deal with it and spending money on therapy is pointless. I don't even know what to do anymore. I am scared about my future. I feel like I am going to die alone and poor. I just want my life to change.","1"

"I apologize for the length of this post, but I'm not much of  a talker and these things tend to fester in my mind for a long time before I air them out. i am not sure where the best place for this post is, so I may put it in multiple subreddits.  I feel like I am losing control now, and something horrible is going to happen. I am no longer feeling ""positive"" about anything. Whereas before I sometimes felt hopeful about things and strived towards socially acceptable goals(although I inevitably fucked up every single time), I am now simply filled with rage. Before it was mild anxiety, or sadness, or hopefulness. Now it is just hopelessness, despair, and RAGE. I feel like I need revenge on something. I cant put my finger on it, but someone needs to pay for my life, and not just mine. I want to break things, I want to scream, I want to beat people to a bloody pulp for minor annoyances. I have never been a sociable person, although I have tried to be in the past two years.   All of these efforts seem wasted, because just like all of my other endeavors, fitness, healthy eating, learning a new language, musical interests,  etc, they are obliterated and made useless in at most a few months, when I slump back into an acceptance of the meaninglessness of life, and feel as if I am unplugged from the matrix. This analogy is a strong representation of how I feel about life in general. Other people are always working towards something and all of their problems seem to be related to that concrete thing. I cant even get past the idea of why I should give a shit in the first place. Perhaps I am cuttoff from the biology that allows them to feel meaning. I am unplugged from my coworkers, my friends, my family. People always say, take a step away and look at a sunset, isn't it beautiful?. Is this supposed to be a trump card or something? Fuck no it isn't beautiful, its just a waste of my time!. Does anyone truly believe in these platitudes, or is it simply a desperate grasp at happiness? IT makes me feel so alien and as if I am simply of a different species when people tell me to do this. Or to find a hobby, or do something I enjoy, or follow my passion. Obviously I do all of these things to the best of my ability, with little success. Perhaps I really am an alien, if the solution is this evident to to other people, and meaningless to me/  Things are only getting worse despite my recent efforts. I don't want to try to get better again. I feel like I am simply pulling the wool over my eyes for a few weeks only to have it inevitably ripped off like a band-aid, and immersed back into the horrifying, real, hopeless world that I know. The temporary hope only makes this process more painful. I hate everything. I used to want a girlfriend. Now I cant understand why anyone would want a girlfriend. I don't want anyone to have these things, I wish only the worst for others. I used to want children. Now I could never bring myself to perpetuate this species, and to bring more people into this world. I hope for the apocalypse. Every day now has simply become a matter of distracting myself until the next day. Its getting more and more difficult. I see no future any longer, which can only mean death. But not before something horrible happens. I am too angry and have too much dignity to simply take myself out of the equation. I have the sinking feeling that someone or something needs to pay for my life. I know it doesn't make sense, but nothing does. I feel abandoned, I am a 20 year old male, and I feel like my childhood was a lie. It didn't prepare me for life as a 9-5 worker. I wasn't quite raised on a silver spoon, but to many I would be. I was raised on the fantasies of the adventures of adult life, rather than grown to accept them. I am not used to feeling this alone, or this independent. My parents always had money, but what they didn't give me was a reason to live. No religion. And many people seem to be able to cope with this, but I cant for some reason. When I fall, there is nothing there to catch me. I mostly live plagued by those dreaded existential thoughts that can never go away. I feel like the next 50 years or so wont be able to compete with my childhood and will only get much much worse. Why should I keep on living? I am having the most terrible thoughts now, blaming others for my misfortune, hating people simply to have something to do, and even though I know they are illogical, I see no reason not to feed them. My life has not gotten better, it has shown me the carrot for brief periods of time, only to plunge me deeper into darkness than ever the next second. I am starting to grow irreversibly bitter. I feel that the truth of the world is horrible. I am starting to accept that. All I do is eat, watch porn, play video games, and watch TV. These are the only things I can sort of focus on. This is not for lack of trying. I have tried innumerable activities. I lose interest in them very quickly. I have attempted to develop the supposed key to life, the holy DISCIPLINE, numerous times and have failed miserable every fucking time. I have tried using a checklist to make my goals manifest, have tried taking things slowly, making small changes here and there, have tried to delay gratification. But why should I? Evidently this question defeats me every time. I am cursed with a brain that thinks itself out of existence. Many people seem to buy right into life. Caring about others, feeling guilt and shame, and happiness, and  sadness. They follow these emotions as if they mean something. As if they have some true level of authority and give them the right to continue to live, a warrant of sorts. I have come to view my emotions as simply another level of control my body and the world put upon me, mere shackles.   I feel like I have a front row seat to the making of a monster. The first step to becoming a monster is to cast off your emotional shackles. The next is to deny responsibility. I have a hard time beleiving in free will, so this has already been accomplished. The last step is to lose hope in a future. Despite the near completion of this process, I feel a strange urge to look back at the illusion. That illusion of  society, unity as a species, love, longingly. I am a little bit afraid to cut ties with this. My whole life has been guided by the facade of a common good, objective meaning, and love for my fellow man. And it has been gradually ripped from my mind piece by piece. I am mildly terrified by all of this, and as always, confused. Is it possible to escape this ?","1"

The people who sent me money kept opening up disputes against and paypal took their side, even though I told them about my thoughts and showed them pictures of my conversations with the guy who gave me the job .  Even though Im on prozac, Ive had suicidal thoughts over this because Im so ashamed of myself for being so stupid and being my own worst enemy.  I reported it to ic3 but then I think why should they help me? I got myself into this mess.  I told my mom about this but she was disappointed in me and didnt make me feel better I know I need to get back up and find a real job but it seems so overwhelming and scary right now. In September  I was vacationing in Montana with $6k and now Im going through financial trouble again. I have a lot of  student loan debt and going to need new breaks and tires soon. Really brings me down.  This is going to make me sound like a narcissistic selfish cunt, but when I think about those stories about rich people being depressed, I feel jealous but keep it to myself. I cant help it. Then again I shouldnt feel jealous because they are probably successful and not a dumbass like me. I just spoke to a free mental health crisis counselor and now gonna look for ongoing counseling for this.  Sorry about the self pity party. TL;DR: was stupid and got myself financially fucked over and just hating myself for it. If you read the whole thing, thanks for your time. ","1"

"I don't have interests because I'm too unintelligent to learn about anything, even when I want to. I never did great in school. I don't understand people or how to befriend them. All around I am a very stupid person.Whenever I look for support people tell me to get a hobby, go look out in public, or something. But I'm too stupid for any of that to work. So I think I'm not fit for life.I don't have friends and people never really like me. I don't know what I'm waiting for from life. I've never enjoyed life. I don't know what I expect to happen but I still have a little optimism.I have to wonder if I was born like this or I became like this. I was molested as a child and I believe that might have given me depression and possibly PTSD though I'm not sure about that. But I have been depressed from a young age and that didn't help me growing up.All I want is friends and support, I would be the happiest I've ever been. I've never had someone tell me they love me or someone who wants good things to happen to me. I can't imagine having someone like that. I'm just not interesting enough for friends.","1"

"At the beginning of the year I was going through complete hell when dealing with clinical depression and anxiety. Living day by day was a struggle. There were days where I felt depersonalization, loneliness and pure sadness. I'm happy to say I'm functioning almost normal again but numbness and rumination still remains. If you're reading this don't give up your fight just yet. It'll become better in the long run ","1"
"Hi, I'm F[18] and last year/this spring I ended up with a depression, the second time in my life. As I was 12, I developed an eating disorder which continued as a depression and then led to some test for autism and ADD. The test come out somewhat positive but still very unclear and I have never related to them either. They prescribed me on top of the antidepressants and sleeping pills some Ritalin and later they changed it to Elvanse. Jumping forward a couple years, I'm still taking Elvanse and just as the Ritalin, it gives me some side effects - like headache, sleep deprivation, loss of appetite. No doctor took notice of this so I kept taking them for a couple of years. So last year, medicine was all wrong at the same time as I went through the toughest year in school AND I managed to fuck up almost all my relationships with friends. Some due too jealousy, some due too an arising depression. Letting go of some of these people was hard but really, REALLY good. I don't see any reason to go into my depression any deeper but it was pretty bad.After a while, I actually got some real help and some better medicine. I bought myself a little puppy, Lola, who became my new friend and routine helper. Stuff got a little better and the summer came. I had some trips planned with my family and I actually looked forward to them. My mental state was actually good! I met a guy, who lives 4 hours flight from me which was kinda perfect at the time because I couldn't be coughed up in this relationship like I've done before...School started and it went okey. No social stuff but still okey. It felt good. Met the guy a couple of times during the autumn and my dog Lola made me company every night etc. But now I'm starting to miss having some friends but I have no idea how to find new once. So I'm asking you, other past-depressive people of Reddit who have been in the same position, how'd you do it? Because even if I feel like getting social again I'm still insecure and unmotivated from the depression which makes it all more confusing for me. And btw, sorry if I'm unclear in my storytelling or/and grammar.. :)","1"
"Its been a few weeks since I've been done with my Ketamine Infusion. I'll try to to keep it short and simple and I'll be around to answer any questions if they come up.What it didnt do:1. I didn't have any trippy experiences or out of body while being on ketamine. 2. Didn't do anything at all for my anhedonia. 3. Didn't eradicate depression. What it did do:1. Put me in more stable and calm state, no more highs/lows but more of a baseline mood.Where depression is still there but not on the endless loop cycle as it was before.2. I'm starting to do small things bit by bit, reading, working out, cleaning up my room , getting rid of stuff I don't need.3. I can't be around too much negative stuff anymore,sometimes I do get stuck being caught in it but can quickly get myself out. 4. Starting a small part time gig doing repetitive stuff which I think is good for me right now. 5. Mood swings are almost non-existent.Will it benefit you? I can't tell but I would have to say if its more related to glutamate then Ketamine may be of help. Alot of our diet and a few other things wreak havoc on our glutamate system while most of the mainstream chooses to just talk about dopamine and serotonin. Glutamate being out of wack is a serious condition that can lead to horrible diseases down the road.I feel that this can be extremely beneficial to those with suicidial thoughts, depression loops, and need something to cut that thought pattern. You may also have to go on other medications as well, since ketamine can give you brain a break from all the negative thinking and then throw in something to give you motivation to get stuff done. It sucks how much the treatment costs.I'd love to do it once a month. When  ketamine works right its almost like it shuts off a part of your brain that wants to be depressed and over think things. Almost like an anti-anxiety with slight relaxing euphoria. But it doesn't last long. I truly believe the god of dissociatives and depression healing in the future if it ever makes a comeback and begins trials will be MXE. I've tried all sorts of medications with absolutely horrible side effects. While the 2 weeks I did Ketamine wasn't too much fun (had highs/lows) ,once it was over I've been put in this relaxed state of mind. Only bad thing is  that since I have nothing to do or like due to anhedonia it can drive me a bit crazy at times.","1"
"Hey all,I'm a college student and this semester was absolutely horrible. One of my closest friends who helped me so much through this is dead, I hate my classes, I'm starting to hate friends, and I just generically have no hope for anything. I don't want to drop out but I don't want to sit at home and work and work and work endlessly. I'm barely finding the motivation to finish this post. I can't find the motivation to finish a half-page cover letter to an extremely important apprenticeship for the summer that I need, and I've been working on that for literally 3 weeks now, for half a fucking page. Just, how the hell do you cope with this? Video gaming is a bore, I'm exercising my sorry ass off, I eat healthy, I read, and nothing is helping me. I'm trying meds and I hate them. I've tried journaling to cope and it's done nothing but made it worse. The person I could just hug it out with and talk to forever is gone. Just what the fuck? How do you manage this shit? Fuck this depression.I do hate to say I've fallen enough where I've tried/attempted/made an attempt to kill or hurt myself 5 times in total these past 3 months (wussed out trying it with a knife twice, next time I messed up the noose and it failed(The closest I've gotten), third I tried to  walk to a bridge to jump off but couldn't after a friend saw me and wouldn't stop following me after they detected something was wrong with me, after that I generically tried choking myself out with a belt which clearly does not work).I mean, I dunno I don't want to die but fuck this. I hate this shit. I talked about all of this with her and she always comforted me and just hugged it out with me until I was better, and now she's gone. I'm trying to talk about this little by little with my other closer friends, but they don't understand. Like yes I'm depressed stop over reacting. I don't know how I'm suppose to bring up my attempts.I don't know what to do. I've got a school break in 2 weeks and desperately want to get better in my month-long break. I desperately want to get off working at least until Christmas to cope. I don't want to take a college break. I want to come back happy next semester. ","1"

"I was very depressed as a kid. I lost a parent when I was 10, but it didn't affect me directly. It was having nothing to do, no parent to guide you. My dad (who took care of me) had lost his wife so he was in bad shape and never really gave me attention. I played video games,  a LOT. 10 hours a day. I failed school and got a dead end job, all that rubbish.Then, while I was 17-19 I found it. I found the thing that took me out of what seemed to be a depression cycle. I started earning good money. I mean really good money. Money a 17 year old shouldn't earn. But I was the best salesman that company had ever seen because I just wouldn't stop chasing the money. Like a fucking rabid dog. Them two years I worked my ass off to make my own company, because I wanted more and more money. I took better care of myself, but most importantly I got a girlfriend. It was like I never realised I had depression, and I had finally broken out of it. I could walk into any public place with a smile on my face. I felt like people were always happy to see me. Felt like the king of the world.I started my business, it failed. I learned a lot. I didn't give up, I was on the verge of doing well. I got back to the drawing board, working hard to rewrite my mistakes.Then my dad kicked me out. 2 months I was sleeping in my car, no contact. I was in a bad place, but still happy. I had my girlfriend, and got another deadend job so I could invest the proceeds to my business.Then my girlfriend left me. It's hard losing the first girl you love, we were together for 2 years. Combined with the lack of money and progress, and the homelessness, that's where I slipped back into the depression cycle.Right now it's the weekend, usually I'd be out for dinner, or away visiting another city or even country. I had everything, yet here I am writing my thoughts out in the hope to find some motivation.My business is all set and ready to go. I've been working at this dead end job for 5 months, saving as much as I possibly can. Everyone took the piss out of me at the start. I was put in bins, stones thrown at me. Beaten up, verbally abused every day.I don't know if I'll ever be like I was. I would much rather relive the last two years than the rest of my life. All I know is that I have been working my ASS off. I'm talking 16 hour days.They say money doesn't make you happy. Maybe it doesn't to the majority. But I strive to be wealthy. It's what I've always wanted. On the new year I'm going to get back to business, and start making some serious money. Quitting both jobs. No bullshit, no feeling guilty for leaving. I'm going back to the person I used to be, taking no shit from anyone. Get myCharisma back. Clean myself up.I've worked so hard to reach the level of happiness I've always wanted. I just hope that it works out.","1"

"I got the nexplanon implant almost a year ago and as a form of birth control I love the fact that it's always just there and I don't have to ""maintain"" it (like taking a pill every day) and I especially love that it's completely stopped my periods.Since I got it I've noticed myself having more mood swings and feeling depressed more often, especially after 6 months when my periods stopped. I know these are possible side effects but I don't know if they are coming from the implant or if it's just me and I don't know what to do. Like I said I love it as a form of birth control and the main reason I chose it is because I know I wouldn't be able to swallow a pill every day since I hate swallowing pills. I also know that most forms of contraception have the same possible side effects so switching to something else would likely have the same effect on me.I know I have a tendancy to be depressed anyway before I had it but it has got a lot worse, however there are other factors making my life very stressful at the moment so I don't know if the implant is to blame.I've obviously been thinking about going to the doctors but I'm worried they'll just want to take it out when I'd prefer to go on medication for my mood if possible. I've never seen a doctor about it before because it's always been something I thought I could handle on my own, I was embarrassed and I don't believe in medicating everything (for example if I have a headache I'll never take aspirin etc I'll just try alternative methods to alleviate it). Now it feels like it's taking over too much of my life and I've been getting into depressed moods that last for days, sometimes weeks, at a time and I just can't shake them off anymore.What should I do and what's your opinion on changing contraception method?","1"
"A while back I was really depressed, but after anti depressants and some therapy I started feeling really chill. Actually, I have been feeling quite happy and relax lately.

Appetite issue: Have been binge eating...okay that can be an issue Sleep too much, do not feel like getting out of bed...may be that's an issue too  Some anxiety, well its mainly due to work probably Okay, i have above issues, but I do not feel like trapped and sad and troubled...My doc insists the issues I have are signs of depression. I mainly go to her due to social phobia and these discipline issues etc, I have been feeling fine overall though. What has been stressing me out is actually the fact that she said I am still troubled while I have been thinking I'm fine..that's what's been stressing me out and is making me wanna cry.Also, feelings like ""guilt"" and ""worthlessness"", I do not think I really have those, but she says you are in denial, you are trying to make excuses....Really I am not the kind of person who does wrong to others, so why would I feel guilt...and ""worthlessness"", I have been an independent and career oriented person, yes I have flaw of interpersonal skills, but that does not make me ""worthless""...I do not like that she is insisting like that...is she stereotyping me or something...Any thoughts?

"Hey whoever reads this..So I have some things I am longing to understand and I'm hoping maybe someone can help. I always found myself quite different from others, still normal but like I had something else too. When I was around 14 my interest in and desire to experience something more became manifest and I got into smoking hash which eventually turned into almost 10 years of daily smoking weed ( with some breaks here and there) I also got into cocaine which I believe was very damaging to me, also speed, MDMA.. I suffered alot and when I look back now it seems that from 16 onwards I was a mess, alot of depression and struggle. I stopped all drugs by age 22 , hardest thing to stop was weed, after I stopped I was a mess, the world was empty to me , had anger issues, couldn't find any pleasure or peace or normality anywhere.. around this same time I started to notice a pattern.. that I would have 2 weeks where I felt really good, the world was great and I loved myself and life.. then I'd have 2 weeks of horrible depression like someone had switched the life switch off.After noticing this I began to research over the next few years and became convinced that I had bipolar ( the more mild type not sure if it's type 1 or 2 , think it's 1 ) so this went on for few years , up and down up and down until recently.. This year since august something really changed.. I haven't felt that ""high"" , mania , or normality.. whatever it actually is.. it just doesn't come anymore.. and I'm going through hell trying to figure out what's wrong with me and how to fix it or improve it.. last few months I feel like I've lost my identity, lost my personality, lost my existence.. I have no desire to do things, I always feel unsatisfied and am longing to feel the goodness of life again.. I believe I have some damage or problem in my dopamine system, my symptoms exactly match those of a dopamine deficiency.. Now I have done much research into supplements , and have tried a few.. they do nothing at all for me for some reason..THE ONLY THING THAT FILLS THE EMPTY GAP AND GIVES ME LIFE AND FEELING IS DARK CHOCOLATE OR COCAO. This is the only thing that can do that, and I really want to understand why , what's going on in my brain when I take cocao ? And what does it indicate, can I work out from this what my problem is ?There's too much information about depression and the different reasons behind it , so hard to find out what my specific issue is.. I really want to see some kind of doctor who really knows what they're doing and can do tests and find out what's actually wrong with me , why I don't feel right and how to fix it.. I'm wondering if anyone here can help or share anything with me, seems it's the easiest place to find help and someone to share with.. Thanks for reading this if you did :) and please if you have anything to share don't hesitate.. ","1"
"I've been depressed for basically my whole life. Recently it's gotten bad again. I've gotten pretty damn good at hiding it from the world. Until last night when, at a holiday party at my own apartment, I drank too much, basically started crying at the dinner table, went upstairs, blew chunks, sobbed in the shower and went to sleep. While everyone was still there. I feel like I've outed myself to all my friends. Now it's 5 a.m. and I can't sleep cause I'm thinking about the disaster that was me last night.

"Ive never done this before. My mother always taught me to keep personal life and problems to myself. I am 28 yrs old(male) and ive been feeling depressed for a while now but recently its becoming so crippling unbearable its hard for me not to break down all the time. Its a long story but i feel alittle background will help you understand how I feel.I have always been a happy go lucky kid. Never the cool kid but everyone loved me and i loved everyone. I always wanted to please everyone i could and somtimes i would purposly take the brunt of jokes to see someone else smile or happy. Maybe because i felt the pain of being sad and never wanted anyone to ever feel that way. Anyways, my dreams were always small. Have kids, raise a family, buy a house have a decent job and car. Basically all i ever wanted. Even when i was in my teens these were basically all of my main goals in life.Cutting to the chase somewhat. A girl i always had a crush on in middle and high school was my best friend. I was infactuated with her. Loved everything about her. I am hispanic and so is she. And i knew she always had this little spicy attitude to her but for the most part she was practically perfect in my eyes. No drugs, doesnt smoke, not a partier, doesnt drink unless socially and very family oriented. Eventually after high school i took a gamble and told her my feelings which she responded by sharing she had the same feelings for me. We started dating (in order to do so i had to basically destroy my life, story for a different time) and we were so inlove. I never felt so happy. Love making multiple times a day, every time our hands met i could feel goosebumps surging through my whole body. And that went on for about 10 months. Then we had a daughter. For the record i think being a father is the best thing i do in life. She is a great mother too. But down the road we started resenting each other. We knew we were essentially perfect for each other but our prides always made us butt heads. We started fighting so much our neighbors would complain about us over in the other apartment.Alot happened over the next few years like her cheating on me with my best friend aka her ex (once again anither time) but after a year breakup period we began dating again. We now have 3 kids. I dont kno if i truly ever knew the type of person she was but at this point she is so cruel its unbearable. I never met anyone more jealous in my life. Always asking me who im with and calling me every  10 minutes if i go out, thats if she ever lets me. Over 10 years of working at the same job she has created confrontation with atleast 70% of my female co workers, how im not fired yet because of it is beyond me. She gives me no respect and always talks at me instead of conversating with me. She loses her temper over very trivial bullshit and always end up screaming where our neighbors neighbors can hear. When she gets mad its like she forgets about our kids just becomes so cruel to the family, when she isnt in a bursting rage she is actually a great mother i must admit.I am def no saint but i always initially try to be respectful to her and talk to her and try to make us come to a solution to our arguments but never to any avail. I usually end up apologizing just to stop the usless fighting. 95% of our arguments essentially consist of me asking to be spoken to with respect and she overly upset about, i dunno, dirty dishes or laundry on floor or def about random women. Ive tried breaking up multiple times but she always threatens me with taking my kids from me or moving to a diff state or get about $800 in child support from me for every kid. She has done a few of these already in the past. She manipulates the courts so well and tbh im awful in court. (Btw i bring my daughters to school every morning and tuck them in at night. I need them in my life daily they r the only things keeping me from falling apart). Didnt mention this earlier but i always kept the relationship together in the beginning chapters cause i believe raising kids in one household like my parents did. Ive seen them fight and work it out so why couldnt i? Well thats what i use to think. So over time i gave her large assurances that i wanted to have a happly ever after and stop fighting. Our bank accounts are combined(she doesnt work), we have a 2015 nissan, we bought a house together in both our names. She basically has my life in her palm. Yet the fighting just keep getting worse. To the point we r both screaming at each other everyday.I feel like im steping on glass around her. She is upset about everything and anything. Shs says she hates me and wishes i was dead that i ruined her life daily. Tbh recently i met my breaking point and have been telling her the same. All i fight about is wanting her to talk to me calmy and with respect. Everyone we know thinks we r this perfect couple cause i always put on this front and we have so many successes.I recently started realizing im actually mad at myself for allowing myself to hand my life over so easily to another human being. My life is not my own but its honestly my fault. I now have a stable job, beautiful kids, great new car, amazing house and a family. I met all my goals i wanted in life and im so incredibly pained. I can not feel more sorrow then i do now. Im sad and hurt. This pain has become unbearable. Knowing im going to live the rest of my life like this or live in studio apartment barely seeing my kids for the rest of my life. I feel so depressed, i wanted to kill myself a few times but honestly i never would. Im to much of a pussy to do it and also ill never hurt my kids like that. But somtimes i just take a quick drive and breakdown so my kids dont see me sad. Im still that happy go lucky guy on the outside to everyone. But inside im in so much crippling sadness i can feel it physcially on my chest. Its embaressing, im a grown man  and all i want to do is fall on the floor curled up hoping somone would come save me. It saddens me deeply i might have to live another 40 years feeling the way i do now. It kinda feels like the time my grandma past away and i was so crushed. But this pain is amplified by 2 and i feel it everday, every hour.I dont think there is anything for me to do at this point but i was hoping writing this would relieve this swollen pain in my chest a bit. I guess i dont really need help but im feel glad someone else knows my story.","1"

"I've been having some slight medical issues, so I've been bedridden and not getting much done for the past few days. And, some days, I just take a series of naps, waking up at all hours of the night (for instance, I woke up about 4:30am, and it's now 5:00am, and I'm still exhausted).Yesterday, I had a huge feeling that I just wanted to go out and hang out with friends, like I used to, but I couldn't think of anyone I wanted to hang out with. That's when it really, officially hit me -- I have no actual friends. The only sort of ""social outlet"" I have is my work, where I talk with others sometimes. But, there's nobody that I hang out with in my day-to-day life. Not one.So, when I'm at home, in bed, feeling like crap, wishing I could get back to my old self and get my work done, I'm left to realize only one thing:Nobody is missing me right now.","1"
"This post isn't for sympathy but rather to hear your stories if you're in a similar position, your views on it and how you deal with it. I didn't have many friends in school and eventually I became used to being by myself. For the last few years I have absolutely loved my own company and still do many things alone. I've gone abroad many times by myself, had dinner watching the sun set over the mountains and have eaten at restaurants with my only company being street cats wanting food.  I'm now changing my life around and taking exams to get me on the path to my dream career. I don't have any form of parental support, friends who are uninterested in my journey and don't know I'm depressed, and an unsupportive partner. Even if I do well who will I celebrate with? For the first time in my life I actually feel lonely... I'm on medication but medication cannot change the fact I have no one being there when I fall or to celebrate with when I succeed...

"I'm under so much pressure right now that I feel I'm so done with everything. Not only having to finish college, I'm working to financially support myself, applying for grad school, and then have to live up to expectations of so many people around me. You know what, part of the reasons I'm applying for grad school overseas is to get away from my own family who always care for their own business and yell at each other all the time.But grad school application is not at all easy. As a college senior I'm still too green to decide on my research field, and every mentor of mine keeps telling me my essays are not deep enough, my performance should be improved to impress the admission commitees. They ask me what I can do to contribute to my future profs' work. I don't fuking know okay??? I know that I want to learn more, that's all. Is it a crime to not know what I can do for a research field???I can't give up. Really. I have to get out of this country right after graduating from college or my family will force me to get a job and get married. Yes but that's what my family will do.I can't give up.

"The ineternet has been my refuge, but lately there are two reasons I feel almost sick logging on. One is boredom: I'm bored. Nothing is interesting, and I just sit there reading or watching mindless things I happen across. I can't bring myself to use the internet for anything useful - I've thought about taking classes, but can't being myself to expend the effort, I don't know why.  The other is fear. That's the strangest and most bizarre. I'm coming down off some very odd obsessions, basically rejoining reality after a year or so. I mean, I'm usually off in some fantasy world, disconnected from what's going on in the world, but never so much as this. Along with coming out of that, I guess I've been trying to be more involved in the world, in life...and I end up overwhelmed. I never know what's true or not. There's argument and confusion around every corner on every issue. Ideals can't survive, or at least mine can't in the face of so many screaming that people like me are stupid and wrong. I don't know what to think, like, believe, want, or do. Some deeply held ideals and outlooks came close to dying - not because of evidence, so much, you can't really prove or disprove an abstract worldview. But just because of hearing so much to the opposite, I can't fight doubt. And yes, there are some other issues, trying to reevaluate beliefs, being wrong and feeling like more and more of a failure.And of course, that's to say nothing of constantly running into drama, bullying, the world going to hell (and being simultaneously inspired to do something, anything at all...and too empty and discouraged to bother) that I can't bring myself to look at it for very long. I hate myself for this - I feel like a coward, like I'm weak. I can try to tell myself at the very least I need a break from constant internal crises, time to recover and figure myself out again emotionally. In fact, I really like not logging on every day, or at least only occasionally. I feel so peaceful, if a bit bored, until I go online, then this sense of anxiety and emptiness sets it. I'm not sure what to do. I have no motivation, I'm bored, I'm nervous about everything, I'm lonely but want nothing to do with people. And I feel so empty and hollow I could die.","1"

"No matter how hard I try, people just hate me. Im the quiet girl in class, dont start talking unless spoken to. I do my shit and get good grades. It started off with my fake friends who ditched my birthday plans. So I cut them off, it was easy to anyways because highschool had separated us. But I kept them on Snapchat incase I was going to get classes with them senior year (because that would be awkward to deal with) , well it didnt happen so I guess I can remove them all. I try to be friendly at school, but then they go off with other people. So I fell into videogames. Its the best escape I could ever ask for in life, as far as I know lol. I gained people I consider friends, but it hasnt really been going well since, I hurt them all. Im not kidding when I say all the friends Ive made online just tried to go after a relationship. So the cycle was always: become friends, they ask you out, I say no, and we just fade apart. P.s I have only met 3 girls online and they all hate me because guys go after me.. even though it just happens and the only way I can stop it is just stop talking to guys in general. So Ive only kept the 2 online friends that respect me and my current (yes I really dug my own grave) online relationship.My father knows about my sad life. He doesnt approve and doesnt consider the people I meet online are friends. I even had a mental breakdown in front of him revealing how shitty school life was and how alone I felt in the real world. How I would just do my work, and look forward to video games because it made me feel better. He just told me he didnt know what to say and that was it. I feel.

What do I say when he tells me he wants to die? What do I do if he asks me about the purpose of life? Because I really don't know, I have the same problem.Right now, the plan is to bake some awesome cookies and spare them in an emergency can, be the cheerful friend as best as I can (it's hard for me sometimes) and bring a movie when he asks me to come. To tell him ""let's talk if you want or just watch the movie and when you want to talk press stop.But what if he can't stop thinking about suicide when I'm there?

"First off, I'm not the most grammatically correct or articulate, so forgive me.My wife and I have been married for three years and together four, and we love each other dearly. She is 23 and was 19, still living at her step mom and dad's when we met. We dated for a while and she moved in. I was in college, but had a part time job good enough to keep us afloat, but barely. She had a myriad of problems that I learned about. All mental, such as depression, anxiety, etc. Her step mom didn't believe in doctors and refused to help her. A long story short, after all if these years, multiple doctors and a misdiagnosis of bipolar disorder, she finally has the right medication. She found a job a little over a month ago and it is a decent one. One that she can make a career out of, plus she enjoys it. This is the first job she's ever been able to hold and I couldn't be more proud of her. I had to transfer to a four year school and graduated last May. Since then I've been jobless. I can't find anything with my degree. Also, I've been very depressed for years and I've never been able to see a doctor foe myself. All of the money went to her doctors and medication. We simply don't have the money for me to see one anymore. All of these years I worked and worked to help her get to where she is. To help her get medicine, a vehicle, a career, an apartment, and a good life. She has worked her butt off and it payed off.But now I have nothing left. I'm depressed. So much so that I can't hardly force myself out of bed. I'm unemployed, student loans are piling, she is taking care of me and paying all of the bills alone. I have no motivation, no will, to do anything and we can't afford a doctor. We have one vehicle and there are no free or reduced cost clinics near us that are even worth it, as she went to the only one and we got her out of there fast. That place was awful. She is paying for everything, and if I wasn't here, if I left, she would financially fine. After all of these years she is finally self sufficient, and now I'm dead weight. I can't get out of my own head.She would actually have more money if I divorced her. If I left and tried to stay with my mom until I found some other job. My wife would be successfully without me, and I feel like a 25 year old bum. I simply can't do anything. I feel so weighed down with no direction, no motivation, no way of getting help.Also, the depression isn't just now rearing its ugly head. I've been depressed since I was a teen, but my mother's answer for it was to simply ""Get over it cause it ain't gettin' no better."" What do I do?","1"

"I dont know if this is the right place to post this, but it is making me very depressed so I figured it was suitable. I am a maintenance worker at the retirement home my grandma lives at. I am 24 and I have been in the construction industry for a few years, so Im not new to the trades, but by no means do I know everything. I still have lots and lots to learn. A lot of people assume I got hired because my grandma lives here so it was a conflict of interest, but really it cant only be that, I am licensed and certified in heating and air, which is what they needed someone knowledgeable in his field in the maintenance department, so I demonstrated my skills in the interviews and I was hired. Anyway, I have worked here for about 10 months now, and there is this older Mexican man we will call him M, and M has worked here for around 8 Years and he is in his 40s and he is highly skilled and knowledgeable about anything construction or maintenance related. He is what is causing my depression. Instead of trying to teach me things when I cant figure something out he tells me figure it out on your own, thats how you grow up anyways. And he walks away. He says this so much so to the point where now I fear even asking for help because he talks down to me like this. It seems as though he is constantly trying to undermine me. I dont know why because I have always tried to be nice to him, nothing else. For example, this happened just yesterday on our lunch break. We have another third coworker in our maintenance department we will call him Q. Q is about 30 and he is much more skilled and knowledgeable than me, but no where near as much of an expert as M. Q has grown to become one of my bestest of friends over the past 10 months so much so that I would want him to stand by my side in my wedding next year. He always has my back, like I wish M did. Anyways, yesterday at lunch M said, I once got called in to work at 3am when I was on-call. And Q responded, What?! 3am?! Man, I have to go to sleep at some point so my phone is on silent at that point in the night. And, all I did was agree with Q and say that thats crazy. So Q has been working here for 3-4 Years so he is much closer with M and M doesnt try to undermine Q like he does me. So, M went to upper management and said that I said that I wont answer the phone after a certain time when Im on call because my phone is on silent and I want to sleep, when in reality I am not the one that said that, Q said it, M was just trying to undermine me and make me look bad to management. So, yesterday before I left work, management came to me and told me to remember you have to have your phone not on silent when you are on call in case there is an emergency and we need you here. You can get written up if you do not answer your phone and you are on call, because that means that someone else has to go in to cover for you when its your turn to be on call. I tried to explain myself that I was not the one that said that I was just really a by standard, but they really didnt believe me because M has been there for 8 Years and I have been here for 10 months of course they will have his back over mine. So I dont get what his problem is with me. M is constantly pulling things like this and micromanaging me and not helping me when I am trying to understand something new and need help. When I need him he is not there but when I dont need him he is micro managing me and undermining me. He is causing some serious depression in my life and I am considering quitting my job. What do you think I should do? Ive tried talking to him and management. I want this all to end and I really just want to quit, but this job is such a great job the benefits are not comparable to any other work place and the pay is amazing not to mention this is where my only living grand parent lives and I would hate to have to explain why I quit to her. Please offer me some suggestions. Thank you for reading my story!","1"

"I was on a certain medication for about a year now and unfortunately just realized it wasn't helping due to the way life was going. I kept thinking ""well the medicine isn't supposed to help (this personal thing), it just supposed to help with my general depression."" Meaning it wasn't supposed to help me feel better when a family member died or I went through a break up or was in a shitty job. I'm currently off of any medication, not because I'm doing better but because of other reasons and I've noticed something. I've had to relearn how to react to emotions. I've been so...blunted and dull for a year. For instance (the good) I find myself laughing at a lot more things. Like seeing something funny elicits more of an emotion than ""-heavy exhale- that's funny"" and ""touching"" things are effecting me more too but I'm also dealing with how to feel frustrated again. Like every small thing I almost lash out. I was wondering if anyone else has had this experience or is there more going on here","1"

"Last night I sent an email to the information officer at my school mentioning my suicidal thoughts and how Id appreciate the counselors email. Today I woke up to find out the police had called my work, my girlfriends work, and they had gone to my girlfriends grandmothers house where we use to live to try and find me. I found my phone and saw a missed call and dialed that number thinking it could only be the police trying to reach me. The officer on the phone was very frustrated that I was feeling depressed and tried to ask for help. He sounded like he just wanted to have a squad car come to my apartment and arrest me. They actually did come to house, but I had already gone to work. So now not only do my new neighbors think we have issues with the police, but my girlfriends coworkers, grandmother, and my coworkers are all asking questions making assumptions ranging from domestic abuse to drug charges. Id like to personally thank my school and the police for handling this situation with upmost care.

"I've been dealing with depression for about 4 years now.. see a psychiatrist, take medication... and at times like most, I have my highs and my lows. Recently I lost my job due to my depression impacting my work performance and that took a bit of a blow on my self confidence... Granted I didn't really feel happy at the job but I would have liked to have left on my own terms. It's just hard when you feel like you have no one to talk to or when no one understands what depression really is. They all think oh just do something fun or force yourself to do thing and you'll be fine.. no depression is more than being sad or being anxious.. I feel like I'm just stuck with where I am... I'm 26 and I feel lost, like I don't know what to do with my life while I watch everyone else improving and doing things that'll push them ahead and I'm stuck playing video games... even that doesn't really make me happy anymore. I admit I don't have any hobbies and I don't even know where to start... I don't even know what I like anymore. I wake up and I feel this pressure in my head, scared, wondering if I'm going to sink into an episode of depression again.. I try to force myself to just do normal things but after losing my job it's just like I have all this open time and I have no idea what to do. I've been applying for jobs of course, but very non-chalantly...as if Though I just don't know. I feel like I can't go to my friends to talk about things or my family because I've bothered them enough with my issues and that's what hurts so much when you feel like you have no one you can turn to and talk to... like you're slowly burning all your bridges and relationships because you don't know what to do... that's basically why I decided to write this and post here.. Just to let some of it off my mind and seek advice when you feel like you're just stuck...","1"

"I have no friends, no family member to lean on or to ask for help, even my online buddies dont even bother messaging me. My mom and dad resents me so much, she favors my twin and my little sister is doing way better than me in everything. All I wanna do is make them proud and be acknowledged but I suffer from extreme anxiety and being depressed and I dont know what to do or where to begin to get myself back on track. Tomorrow extended family is visiting, I dont want to be here while they ask me what I'm doing with my life or even wonder where I'll live once they move to Arizona next year. My only choices are with guys who think of me as sexual objects or become homeless because no one will take me in. I dont know what to do. I feel like I ruined everything when I had so much going for me. All I do sleep, wait for the next day to begin and the same cycle begins.

I didnt keep in touch with any of my friends and now Im all alone and spend my time in bed on the Internet. All I want to do is sleep forever. I get obsessed with small things like tv shows or celebrities to keep myself going and spend all my time thinking about them instead of dealing with the reality of wanting to die every day. I get obsessed with the idea of being in a relationship and having someone who cares about me which is so stupid but I cant help it. I just want to feel less alone.

"(Sorry. May contain some grammar errors as English is not my first language)I met her when I was 8 years old. She's also from my hometown. We went to same school. Gradually we became friends. By the age of 14, I started considering her one of my two best friends. She was a genius girl and I was an average student. I can't exactly remember when I got the feeling 'she's the one for me', but it happened when I was around 16. She must have felt the same way. Suddenly our relationship got changed. The friend turned herself in to a shy girl around me. We became the 'unofficial couple', though I never asked her out.She was the bright, studious girl in our school, and I was not good at studies compared to her. I wanted to be a somewhat valuable boyfriend to her than just being an average guy. So I decided to work on my goals. I started focusing on my studies more than ever. I achieved first rank 5 times in the final 6 exams. We faced the Advanced Level exam (somewhat equal to the SAT in the US) She got selected to the engineering degree, but I wasn't lucky enough get selected for the medicine degree course. I wanted to get selected just to impress her. I worked as hard as I can, and got selected in the next attempt after an year.On the first day of medical school, I asked her out, and she said ""No""!I learned that she had found a boyfriend in the year I haven't been in touch with her.I was shocked hearing that. There isn't any fault of her, but I felt myself useless. I felt all my hard work went in vein. I may have overestimated myself. I wished her good luck and left.Since then my life has become a living hell. I determined not to interfere her relationship. I wanted get myself distanced from her.That happened two years ago. I still feel depressed. I have no interest in studies now. I continuously failed all subjects in the medical school, and missed two batches. Next exam is my last chance to survive, but I have no interest. I felt suicidal several times.I met my college psychiatrist last year, discussed with her about my lack of interest in studies and suicidal thoughts. But I avoided telling her about my friend as I felt uneasy with discussing it with her, and also it might become long and boring. She prescribed me 100mg dose of sertraline. After few months having breathing exercises and antidepressants my treatments ended.I tried to text her few times, but she doesn't seem to be interested in having a conversation with me. Most conversations are limited to few lines, and even for that she responded after days.I don't know what to do now. My best friend has become a total stranger for me now. She is getting her degree end of this year, and I am struggling to pass my first year exam.It's okay that I'm not a good option to be a good boyfriend, but I don't know why I lost her as my best friend. At least I just want to be around her. I have no target in my life as I had few years ago. I didn't let her know about my failures and treatments as she would think that I'm trying to gain sympathy.

To fix that I tried to understand who I was, thinking ""if I know who I am, then I wouldn't mind what they're thinking of me"" and then I realized that  am a dumb lazy loser. All I've been doing for the past 3 years in college was waking up, getting fucked up or waste my time with video games or watching tv shows, and going to sleep. And working on my assignments the very last minute. Every time I tell myself that I'm going to change, it does not happen. Because I'm a dumb lazy fuck that can't get anything done.

"  Im in my early 20s trying to get my life together. My parents are divorced and i currently live my dad(whom i believe is a narcissist). For as long as i can remember hes never been there for me emotionally, yeah hes around for birthdays and some holidays but we never really bonded other than that besides the occasional movie.  Hes been engaged to different women 3 times and each one ended within a year due to his commitment issues which makes me sick but i think has made an impact in my dating life because i cant seem to hold a long relationship. He sends me to grab him food(including his girlfriend who is my age), drive my grandma around, and do house maintenance. I dont mind doing any of this, i understand i live under his house so i must abide by his rules but i feel like its a bit much. He sits in his office all day doing work and everything in the house is my problem. He even makes me babysit my sister for hours while hes working(which he did to me when i was younger) like he cant be bothered with watching her for more than a couple hours so he throws her at me or my grandma. My sister(3 years old) just cries the whole time cause he wont play/watch her(this is mostly on weekends, shes at her mothers on weekdays). Im afraid because of this my sister is going to end up the way i am with my father and end up resenting him in a way. I just feel used and like an object to him, and i cant talk to him about it because we just dont have that relationship. But i do get my privacy in this house which i love, Ive grown to isolate myself.  My mom on the other hand has remarried and has 3 girls that i love to death but honestly Im not that good with kids. My mother wasnt always there for me when i was younger but now that she has all these kids shes much better and really tries to talk an connect with my which i love. But i cant open up to her about me being depressed. Id love to move in with her but i would get no privacy at all.   Ive dropped out of College twice and recently took out a student loan to go back now that Im serious about it . I had a really bad anxiety attack about a month ago and i spent all day thinking about where Im going with my life. I want to turn it around so bad but i feel so overwhelmed. I feel like Im letting everyone down, they had such high hopes for me and dropping out twice makes me feel like shit and i cant stop think about it . I want to be a better Son/brother and make them proud but i just feel worthless and it makes me unmotivated. I also used to be really good at holding down a job, i had a job for 2 years and another for a year but now i can barely hold one for 4 months because every job just seems unfulfilling and a waste of time...i dont know what Im doing but i know i want to go back to school to feel a sense of purpose....   Basically i feel like a burden to everyone and telling them Im depressed to me feels like i would be burdening then even more. I can barely have a conversation with people anymore because i feel like i dont have anything accomplished in life and Im a waste of space.

"I don't like very many of the people in my life right now - in this individual moment - and I know I'll look past it in a few hours, or days, or whatever; I feel like this is a moment of clarity, though, unobscured by the apologies of emotion.

I feel like I'm just a joke to them, like they keep me around to laugh about.

I can't even keep up the pretense anymore. People ask me what's wrong when I'm around because I'm just too tired for the fucking charade, and they don't understand when I tell them that there's nothing wrong - that this is just me, that who they know isn't, because I just don't care enough to even attempt to appease them anymore.

"Im a full time college student, and today has honestly been a good day, for the record.   I got an offer to work as a tutor next semester, and I found out that next week I dont have to take one of my finals due to the fact that I had an A.  I have a new job that pays well, and every physical need in my life is taken care of.  In spite of that, last week I managed to get into hot water with my parents due to falling asleep in church and being generally ungrateful.  On my back to my apartment from their place, I fell asleep behind the wheel of my car and nearly ran it off the road.  The police stopped me, and thankfully didnt ticket me.  Up until today this week,  due to those events Ive felt like a spectacular failure.  Tonight, I went out with a group of friends from a recreational club for an end of the semester dinner, and I left early.   There were two reasons for this, the first being that I saw myself in the mirror again, and remembered how much weight Ive gained this semester from a poor diet and lack of exercise.   The second thing that caused me to want to leave was my inability to interact with anyone.  I saw a friend of mine and a girl that I had tried to date earlier in the semester really hitting it off, and everyone else at the table seemed to be laughing and enjoying each others company.  I just couldnt do it.   I dont know why I couldnt, because I really wanted to.  I wanted to be part of that, but I just cant be fun.  I think both my weight issues and social problems are both causes for my inability to find a partner, which is something thats bothered me since my freshman year of high school.  Even if I managed to get into shape, which I have no confidence that I will given how late I am in my life at this point, I just dont have the personality to keep someone else entertained and happy enough to stay with me.  I have a lot to be thankful for, so I think its wrong of me to even be complaining about this, but my parents and friends are probably sick of the whining.  I dont know who else to talk to right now.  ","1"

"Throwaway account. Things that are contributing to my depression:- I'm a 19 year old female studying full-time at my local community college, due to my inability to work because of my busy school schedule, my boyfriend (21) had to pick up a 50/hr a week job with a one hour commute in order to support us, So he's gone now for 14/15 hours a day 4 days a week, 16/17 hours if there is really bad traffic. I barely see him now. He contributes to a lot of my happiness. - I'm going for a doctorate so I won't even be done with school until I'm 27, and then I'll have to deal with several thousands dollars in student loan debt. I feel such an immense amount of pressure to have a showy career and make an overwhelming amount of money because I grew up incredibly poor with a broken family, in which my dinners either consisted of a handful of otter pops or a $1 Mr.P's pizza split between my two siblings and I. - My boyfriend and I have been together for four years now and were considering eloping next year or the year after, and now I'm scared that i'll get cut off from fafsa If we do so, because it'll change my status to an independent.  - I have no ""girl-friends"", I have tried everything, friendsmatch,  girlfriendsocial, not4dating, strictly platonic forum on craigslist, local subreddits. Nothing has worked. - I have no health insurance, constantly fearful that i'm sick or dying and have no idea. - Sometimes the only ways to get me out of suicidal thoughts is to place myself in a daydream where I have endless money and nothing to worry about, I find myself living in these fantasies more and more lately. - Constantly struggling with anxiety and body dysmorphia, I'm thin now, but can't stop seeing the zit riddled fat kid in the mirror. - I'm growing increasing terrified of where I live, Someone has been stealing my mail for the last month, a man was murdered on my street a few weeks ago, and a hole was shot in my window with a BB gun, my only form of security is my German Shepherd. - The ever growing thought that all of this can go away if I just kill myself, or attempt to go off-grid.

"Sometimes it feels like it might be easier to live a life as a normal 9-5 zombie, plodding along to a job I despise deep down every day. I suppose in ways it would be nice to have a simple life, nothing too mad but to be able to take anything that comes to me. But at the same time although I don't know exactly what it is I definitely want to do with my life, I have multiple things I would love to be doing with myself.A few examples are marine biology, police, paramedics, Royal Navy or working in the TV/Film industry. I also weirdly enough like helping others and get at least some joy out of it despite not even being able to help myself. Despite all these ambitions I can't seem to get myself up to take action on them, I get myself hyped up and watch a few motivational videos to help but they only last for so long. I know not to be jealous but I can't help but look back on Facebook and seeing people from school who tormented me both physically and mentally as a kid doing extremely well, having good homes, money, etc, one of them just got lucky and happened to marry a footballer who plays for a smaller team but she has more money now than she can count and not a penny of it was worked for. I wish I did well in school, in life in general, I wish I wasn't a shell of my younger self who drinks way too much just to cope and give myself some sort of coping mechanism.

"They make comments about being overwhelmed, and they've mentioned being seriously depressed in the past in an offhand way. They show a lot of concern for others who seem stressed or unhappy, the kind of concern that you just know comes from personal experience.

"But I want to share something that's fuckin me up.I got involved with a friend. We are very much alike and we've been attracted to each other for a while until we finally hook up. Now here's the deal: I have anxiety and haven't been able to talk to girls for a long long time, starting to get better just recently. This friend of mine was an exception to the rule and I was actually very open with her. After the first time we hooked up we were texting and I was panicking about her saying she liked that night and wanted to repeat, etc. I guess I feel a lot of pressure hearing this as if I've set some expectation that I can't live up to. So, since my brain was bailing out, I said maybe we shouldn't do it again so we could stay friends and don't ruin that. But I also said that it could happen if it was spontaneous (I guess this was a sane part of myself that knew I wanted it).Anyway, a lot of time went by and we hooked up again. The first time I was drunk and loose, but this time I was sober and it was absolutely great. We didn't talk about it for a while and when we did she told me she was seeing this guy that she really liked and whatever so, again we wouldn't be doing this regularly. But at that point we weren't thinking about doing it regularly, until one day we met and I was being too quiet and she noticed it. So without thinking I told her I really enjoyed kissing her and I wanted more. She had told me she feels very attracted to me and you liked to have me too. Stupid as I am, I told her I was confused because I couldn't see us as a couple and she agreed, but that wouldn't stop us from having a friends with benefits thing. Also she was still seeing that guy and all.As time goes by I begin to think more and more that we would actually be a great couple. We are the closest friends and we are sexually attracted, so why wouldn't it work? Now here's something I didn't know: a male friend we have in common actually hooks up with her occasionally too. I guess this shouldn't bother me since we never had anything serious, but man! Hearing him say they fucked was just a deep stab. And that just got me even more confused about how I feel towards her. I mean, I'm being jealous!I think I felt really disposable after knowing that I just another one of her friends that she uses for pleasure. But that thought doesn't add up to how we interact, me and her... I'm really confused.I had a lot more going on: not knowing what to do with my life, my anxiety got extremely worse to the point I can't eat anymore, I feel like my friends are drifting away and I have nobody to talk about anything, my family isn't the best... I also had a lot of suffering going on in my teenage years about love and relationships (friends included). Thanks thing with my friend was the final drop to release the tears I've been holding back for years.Today I woke up too early, shaking, feeling stomach pain and I just bursted in tears. I couldn't stop crying and I'm almost crying again while writing this.Sorry if it sounds like some bullshit drama, I really don't care right now, because I felt like I needed to get this out of my chest.Tl;Dr: I hooked up with a friend that hooks up with other friends and I got an avalanche of feelings added up to the feels soup. That made me wake up to cry, something I haven't done in years.EDIT: To be clear, that's a reeally compact version of what goes on in my brain. I guess many of you will know that since you probably experience similar things. This story is but a glimpse of what's behind it.","1"

I don't exactly have binge episodes but for probably five years now on a consistent basis I have forced myself to throw up food in order to lose weight or honestly, just to feel good. It's the only thing that makes me happy, like actually happy. I'm obviously suffering tooth problems but nothing severe. The only thing that makes me anxious is people finding out and they're starting to. I also have PTSD and a combination of other issues that make bulimia a convenient way out; the perfect evil as opposed to the other more horrible ones. How can I stop? I know I need to, but how? I don't even want to.","1"

"It started with a panic attack. Just one. No depression, no nothing just a perfectly reasonably stressed awkward lonely college freshman who overloaded on Starbucks. I always listen to what my doctor says so I cut the caffeine and started Celexa. He said the Celexa would help me relax but it made me feel like an amnesic soul recently transplanted into the wrong body. The feeling is unrelenting and haunts me as I write this.After the depersonalization began the depression became clinical where it has since stayed. I don't talk much and making friends among the self-absorbed crowds of undergrads from So Cal is hard, harder than regulating my emotions or understanding Hofstadter's books. The counseling center recommended clubs, I have tried some of them but no one seems to be able to start a club at this school without a politically correct socially just white guilt approved awareness agenda, and you know, that stuff just doesn't really make me feel better about myself-- sorry.My peers feel like... other people. Everyone feels like other people. I just want to be friends with good people but it's hard cause the good ones are so BUSY being good and getting their lives together while I'm... getting by? Hence the title. Lately I just want to read GEB, watch the Star Treks with Picard, noodle on my instruments, and get off on the sweet satisfaction of a perfectly rev matched double clutch into second that is so fine I don't even feel the synchro on the way in-- sorry.Waves of fine-ness come and go. I'll feel just okay for a few minutes here and there, a few days here and there. Those times are nice but I still have the depersonalization which is a CURSE FROM HELL-- sorry.On Monday I'm joining a depression/anxiety group on campus.

"Hey guys,Recently, I've become more and more isolated. I've been hanging out with friends less and less, as my best friend started dating the girl he's been crushing on for years, so he's been spending the majority of his time with her, and the rest of my friends have been curving me recently to hang out with each other. Because of this, I have basically ended up staying in except for going to class, work, church with my family, and visiting my girlfriend. All of this has taken a toll on me mentally, which as only been worsened by the time of year for me. Winter brings on my SAD, and it also triggers a lot of memories of some of the worst times of my life. I've just been feeling like I have nowhere to go, nothing to do, and no one to talk to. My girlfriend is amazing, but I always feel as if my problems would just be a huge burden on her, and she already has enough stressing her out right now that I don't want to make it worse. I don't really talk to my parents about it because, like with my girlfriend, they already have enough to stress about without me making it worse. I haven't felt this terrible in years and I was just starting to feel like I had finally escaped my depression this last year as I entered college, but now it seems like it's back with a vengeance. Sorry if this is a long read, I just really needed to get this out somewhere. Don't feel obligated to reply, but any sort of assistance is much appreciated.","1"

"Ill try to get right to the point with this. I suffer from depression, anxiety, and insomnia. I am alone most days and am pretty much confined to my bed, no school, work, or friends. Ive been seeing a therapist and considering different treatment, excluding medication, and have come to the realization that what I think is best for me is a support animal. I live in an apartment with my boyfriend and another couple who already have two dogs (max limit for animals stated in our lease) and another (secret) cat so I have been avoiding the idea of a support animal (trying to stay on good terms with landlord) until tonight. Tonight, in particular, was hard for me, sleep-wise, due to my boyfriend being sick and constantly getting up to vomit (tmi sorry). I finally was able to sleep after taking melatonin, but was woken by him several times and realized that I couldnt take it any longer (or the smell) and went to sleep on the couch. I realize that this is an asshole-ish move of me to abandon him while hes sick, but he does try to understand what Im going through and honestly, depression has turned me into a bit of a dick. Either way, I end up on the couch, unable to sleep, still, and start thinking those terrible thoughts (suicidal and all) about myself and my life that I always do and begin to feel INCREDIBLY alone. So alone, that Im almost to the breaking point, when I hear a door creak and see the cat hop onto the side of the couch and immediately run to my lap like she was sent from some Devine being to do so. I couldnt keep from bursting into tears. The immediate sense of relief that came over me was insane. She is still here by my side and hasnt left once since I started crying, but honestly I dont know if Id be here right now if she hadnt come..Anyway, Im thinking about suggesting a support animal as a kind of treatment to my therapist, but scared to do so because of how many people I know that have abused the system. I dont want to come off like that, but as bad as Ive been feeling lately, I want some sort of relief soon so I dont keep feeling like I had tonight before the kitty showed up. I need advice on what to do at this point. Suggestions? (Please be nice)","1"

"I graduated with a political science degree in August of 2016. During undergrad, I only worked at Target for 4 years and did an internship in youth advocacy.I graduated with a pretty good GPA, then got a job at a telecommunications company where I only made about 28k per year as a bottom of the barrel, entry level project manager.I spent eight months there until I was offered a job doing legal research for a real estate law firm where I was making nearly 40k per year...it only lasted for 4 months until I got fired for a number of reasons. My anxiety, poor communication at work, and the fact that people weren't buying houses in my area led to me losing my job.It's been three months. I temped at a warehouse for two months, but I'm finally back on my feet working for the state at my DHHR as a youth service worker. Once I finish training, I'll be making around 29k per year, only slightly more than I made at the telecom place...I'm happy that I'm on track now, but upset about the path I've taken in life. I always wanted to help people for a living and I've finally gotten the chance to do so. But the path I took to get here, and the things that I could have done better are haunting me. That, and all of the people my age and older who are saying that my degree is worthless, and that I should have gone to trade school...hey, my parents strongly encouraged me to go to college..I was on track to enlist in the military until my parents threw a fit :\Things aren't all bad. I'm medicated now. I manage my issues much better. I live on my own. But, I'm worried about the future. It'll take over a year until I get a chance at a raise. It'll take four years until I can become a licensed social worker, and two years until I'm offered any tuition reimbursement. I plan on going back to school. But man...right now, I still feel like I'm in the pits. I'm okay, I'm taking it day by day, but this is the worst depressive episode I've had since I lost my job in September.

"Don't get me wrong, depression sucks. Depression can be dangerous. I don't know how to explain this. But my anxiety can be so intense, it makes it hard to breathe and it paralyzes me. Depression is different because for me it's like a heavy emptiness... a lack of everything. In contrast to anxiety, it's like an absence of feeling instead of intense feeling. Therefore I find it ""easier"" to stand depression than anxiety. Has anyone else thought of this?","1"

I don't think it's a bad thing to die, or to inconvenience others, or neglect them. I just legitimately feel like nothing matters. What sucks is nobody respects that kind if outlook. Somehow thinking and feeling this way is immature, sick, and wrong in the eyes of most people. Why is even saying that always associated with immature teenage angst? Why does this line of thinking always have to be intellectually written off by most people? Why does thinking this way have to mean you're just trying to hard to ""rebel from the norm"" and be and ""individual"" with the tone of ""I'mfifteenandthisisdeep""? Idk man. It has to do with stereotyping. I can't even type these words without thinking I come off as an angsty teenager, but that's not how I want to come off. I don't think refusing to fully accept and be happy with the way things are makes a person immature. ","1"
"It's not much but it's something.I'm lucky I live right next to a grocery store. Eventually hunger overpowers apathy (though sometimes it does take awhile). This time when I needed to get food, I decided fuck it, I've lived in this apartment a couple months now and I don't even know the area other than spots I drive to. Might as well go a bit extra since I feel so shitty.So, I threw in some headphones and took a walk for a few minutes before circling to the grocery store to grab some food. It wasn't far. It wasn't really all that much to look at. But it's a start and it made me feel a bit better.It's not some magic cure or something that even really means much but maybe someone will give this a shot too and it'll be a bit of a boost.

"Hi all, I just wanted to let you all know Im rooting for every single one of you. I wanted to write this because my SO suffers with depression and social phobia and Ive realised how important it is to celebrate the small victories and not to punish yourself if you struggle. We never used to be able to go out to eat/drink together as he was struggling, couldnt attend any family occasions or celebrations as it was just too much for him. However, slowly but surely he is improving and weve done everything on that list :) I couldnt be happier.. but what Ive noticed is he still doesnt feel its enough or that hes improvingI think its really easy to assume sometimes once you accomplish something youve struggled with the rest will come easily, thats not the case though and thats ok!There are times he will struggle again and not be able to do those things even though he has done them once.. and I hate that he (or anyone else) would punish themselves for that. Depression is NOT your fault, and even if you accomplish something others may see as small, its a huge victory when struggling with such an illness. Im proud of my boyfriend and Im proud of all of you for fighting everyday. ","1"
"Hi, i never really saw myself doing this so it feels kinda weird to do.Since i was little i was left by both my mom and my dad.My dad left when he heard my mom was pregnant and my mom didn't wanted to take care of me so i had to live with my grandparents. I lived with (Only) them 7 years.Ever since that i always noticed things were not okay. Even when i was really small i was self-conscious of what was happening around me, i knew i did not had a dad, i knew my mom was mean (she would visit every now and then) and i knew my grandparents were just petting with me, treating me as a pet 'cause i was little, not because they actually liked me or wanted to spend time with me.Then things got better, we moved to a better house (An apartment) , my mom came back, i was happy for a little bit, that was until my mom left to live with one of her boyfriends, they would visit, when they were both drunk, and things like that, i remember once they took me to mcdonalds, when i came back i went to my room to show my mom one of my toys and when i came back she had already left with her boyfriend, she ran away from me.The same christmas of that year, i put a chemistry kit on my list, when it came i was super excited and happy, it was like my biggest wish, her boyfriend saw i was super happy and that my mom wasn't even paying attention to me and he said; i think i'm gonna leave, and my mom got mad at me she said i wish you were never born and she ran with him.Again, i was alone.one more year passed and i would see my mom once every month or something like that.She had a fight with her boyfriend, he cheated on her and i found myself on the middle of a house full of fights between her and my grandma, police had to come to separate them like 5 times... At that point i was just questioning why, i would cry on my pillow, or just try to forget about the situation, but the beef would always get to me and they would get me involved in some sort of way, once my grandma was trying to trow a knife at my mom and i jumped to try to get in the middle of it, i couldn't stop it, fortunately it didn't hit her but it was very traumatic to see all of those things happen.I was always bad at paying attention, all of those things made me just daydream a lot or just develop lack of attention to most of things.Although that... I always wanted to learn, i liked it, i could always get used to most of things without having to study them, just by practicing.After that it was just constant fights, every day for the next 5 years.I wanted a good school?No, go to a bad one.I wanted a good computer so i could play games?No, go outsideI wanted to go outside with some friends to some cool place?Nop, too expensiveI got to the point where my mom just sent me to a saturday highschool saying we can't afford a regular one aaand then she would buy fancy boots and clothes and go out, and everything, at that point i had to buy clothes from garage sells and she would get hers at the fanciest places at mall. I was always alone, i never talked to them since i didn't really felt comfortableThey would always treat me bad, make fun of me for saying an explanation, they would talk 'about a certain topic, and i would say oh yeah, it works like that, and they would say; no it works like this (nonsense) and they would make fun of me for getting the right answer, sometimes they would say is there something you don't know? mocking me and telling me to shut up.I tried different things, to accept my life, to just try to be like them, not to talk to them, everything... I just couldn't do anything.Right now i'm working and on college.And my mom wins x20 as me.I told her i needed help with college and i wanted to move somewhere else, since mxico does not have the best colleges and is not the safest place. She's just staying here because of some mxican guy she likes, sad thing is she doesn't even know him, it's a whatsapp boyfriend she met at some bad group of her work, he lives 12 hours away and he's cheat on her twice with her knowing 'about it. I tried to explain i always accepted everything and never complained, but i just needed help to find a better college; and she told me: No, stop telling me what to do, leave me live my life, i tried, i told her how i felt, how i wanted to get out of this country and she would just make fake jiggles, at some point i just couldn't contain myself, i was crying, i was not letting her get out of the door since she always does the same, she walks away and ignores me. she was pushing me and telling me i was crazy and worthless putting her face like 5 cms away from mine it's your problem, it's your problem then i said i'm your son, please help me you can't put a guy you just met 6 months ago before meand she jiggled hard on purpose, i got carried away and i did the movement of pushing her face away but did not touch her, she did a suprise noise and she was gonna start fake cry like she always does (she did that when she used to fight her mom numerous times) but then she noticed i didn't touch her so she did a dumb face and she keep repeating the same. The feeling of her trying to make me feel bad by fake crying, lying to me, laughing about her ruining my life just got me really mad, and i pushed (again not hit)  her face away, she did this horrible fake cry again and played offended for a bit, then afterwards she ran to her mom and dad's (Oh yeah, she's too bussy drinking and buying gucci boots to buy her own house) And she started telling her mom he hit me, he punches womans, he's so mean when all i wanted was her not to say those things in front of my face 'cause they were really really hurting me.3 days before this happened my grandma almost died, she drank a lot of pills, i had to break the door and go through a bathroom window to save her, when they came home they were acting like if nothing was happening, and my grandpa did not wanted to take them to the hospital, i got mad because it was a bad scenario, she was super bad, and he told me something like shut the fuck up you dumb shit I replied with What are you gonna do if i dont? he tried to scare me but as he saw i was not scared he said ok, remember this He's been treating me even worse than he used to.When this happened he came and told me to get out of his house, and that i was a worthless idiot.And now i feel bad and guilty because of that, because i would never ever solve problems with violence, i feel like the worst piece of human being.i just don't know what to do anymore, i've always felt bad 'bout my life,but i've always had hope on one time i'll go to college and i'll make my family proud but they don't even want to help me with that, i can't afford a private college on my own, and public colleges on here don't really give you much, i'm not learing anything and it's only valid on mxico,plus paying for transport is not that cheap on here, i can't even afford food. I've never talk about everything from the past with anyone, there's more, a lot more, but i just don't want to spend 3 hours trying to explain... I've always had hope, but now... I don't even know anymore, i don't see a good thing at all.sorry if my grammar is bad, i was still super shaky and nervous 'bout the situation.","1"

"It seems I've been dealing with this shit my whole life and only recently have I began to see what is going on with me. It felt normal, it felt like who I was. Guess what though, it's not normal, its not me. I'm so god damn sick of feeling like absolute dog shit, day in and day out. Nothing ever seems to go my way and all I've done is blame myself for being such a piece of no good little shit. But its not me. This isnt me. At first I thought everyone felt the same way about themselves, as if this is just the way things go. I'm so sick of it, I really really am. I just want it to stop. I want it all to just stop, but nothing ever does. If I had any quick way to end it all, I wouldn't be here writing this.It's funny though isn't it? Everyone asks if you're okay but no one ever wants you to say ""Hey, you know what? No, I'm not okay, I'm actually pretty damn NOT okay right now."" No one ever really cares. It's so easy to just hide away from all that, give a little smile every once in a while, a little Ha Ha at some not so funny joke and everyone just assumes you're completely fine. At some point though the smiles and the Ha Ha's stop because its pointless. It's all pointless. Nothing ever really matters. I don't know what to do with my life anymore. Whatever interests I've had have all just vanished like the people who kept asking if I'm okay. I don't even have the desire to plan ahead because I honestly don't think I'm gonna make it as far as some people think. They keep saying that it'll be better out of school and when you're out in the real world and all that jazz. Will it though? Will it really be better? I have my doubts, you know why I have doubts? Because I don't even wanna go long enough to find out if it will be better. I just don't CARE. I can't wake up in the morning and suddenly choose to give a single flying fuck if anything will be better. I just want it to stop. The only thing that's stopping me is the little voice in my head, that's getting quieter and quieter, telling me that this isn't me. This is not normal. You are not okay. But its fading and I'm getting pretty scared.","1"
"Its getting to the point where im starting to troll on reddit. Why? Because im bored and angry. I hate this. Everyday im just becoming a shittier and shittier human being. I can tell. I havent drank since my graduation back in may and now look at me. Drunk. Im literally begging to die every single day. I curse Gods name in the hopes that he just takes me. All the money in my bank account cant buy me style, it cant buy me a loving girlfriend, and it cant buy me any sense of self worth. Fuck my job. This is how im spending my Friday night. Wallowing in self pity. Im hesitating to drink more because i know im going to vomit in my sleep and my moms going to figure out what i was doing. Im too old for this.","1"
"Lost all my old friends due to mental illness. Finally made a friend a few weeks ago but they are super busy all the time so idk what to do. Recently hung out with an old ""friend"" and just listened to him complain about his tinder matches (he gets a lot mind you).I don't have the energy to go to events to meet people (thats how I met the friend) anymore. It just seems so pointless despite remembering how good it felt.","1"
"At this point, I just have to laugh at the situation. It's good comedy. Someone's having a good fucking laugh up there.As may be the case with some of you, depression makes me extremely cognitively slow whilst at work. I do this thing where I sort of zone out when I'm forced to endure something I hate. I appear to be present to everyone around me, but consciously I'm really only half-there. I daydream. I've done it my whole life. I can't help it - it's as if it's an automatic defence mechanism. Through school and college and all of the jobs I've had, this has caused me problems.Now, as a 24-year-old man, I'm working as a waiter in a hotel restaurant. I haven't been there long and I don't plan to stay. I don't get on with anyone. All of the staff are quite a bit younger than I am and do not want anything to do with me. I have no self-esteem and I'm absolutely terrified of social interaction. I can't do anything to change it, so I just have to accept it. It's not how I want to be, but that's how it is. I keep my head down, and I don't bother anyone and I get treat like shit in return. I try my best to be content with that, but honestly, it's fucking awful.Very recently, this girl began to focus on me a little bit. It started with her just getting in my face and saying ""hiya"" in a stupid tone, in a blatant attempt to make me feel uncomfortable in front of the other staff. I don't know how to react to that. It did make me uncomfortable. Everyone's looking at me and expecting something back, but I just can't produce anything. I stand there and take it and desperately try to make it appear to have had no effect.Now it's at the point where she'll openly mock me in a room full of people whilst they all laugh. It's relentless. She'll tell people how slow and boring I am. I'll be called a ""fucking retard"" multiple times a day, she'll throw food in my hair and I'm pretty sure one time she spat in my lunch. It might sound like playful work banter, but it's not. And now a few others are joining in.With no one else to talk to, I told my mum about what was happening. It wasn't an easy conversation to have, and she couldn't decide whether or not I was being serious. ""So, a seventeen-year-old-girl is giving you shit at work? There must be something else the matter with you, that can't be it.""She seems to think that the bottom line of my problem is my ego. She says that only an ego is bruised by what people say. ""Ignore your ego, and you'll be fine.""To be honest, she's right. If I had no ego, none of this would bother me. Maybe I should just accept that I'm a little bitch who's terrified of talking to people. A man with nothing going for himself. Someone who'll never meet anyone, never have kids, and never be content with his life. Someone who deserves all of the shit that other people give him. Maybe that's who I am, and who I'll be until the day I die. If I accept that then none of this will hurt anymore.Sounds like a plan?","1"
"From start i would like to say sorry for my english its not my native language, and i really wanted to share my story to anyone.I have been suffering from depression for 5years now if not more. It all started when girl rejected me and i fall apart and givedup on my life, i just don't want to live since then. When i see couples holding hand i just start crying and something hurts inside me and i think in my mind ""This guy, what a life, what he done he lives it like it, he must be living a dream""(I'm a man to be exact 22) I never had any close relationship i have no friends not a single one to meet and spend time with. I don't leave my home to prevent seeing coupes kissing hugging and all this lovely unbelivelbly stuff. I can't sleep at nights i all the time go to sleep at 12PM and actually fall asleep at 4-5AM, in these hours i keep thinking how shitty my life is,none cares about it parents dont give a fuck even tho they know about that i have it. Now about the nights, i keep thinking about how wonderful it would be to have a girl to hold Her hands, to kiss Her, to talk to Her spend my whole life with Her give it to Her all of it, love as none else can, cry from happiness everytime i see Her, and most importantly hugs, thats my biggest dream of them all, to feel Her, Her body someone else touching me, actually feeling that i exist, someone do fucking care about me in this world i would hug Her deeply with pure love without faking it at all, then i sqeeze in my bed crying out loud and hugging my cover really hard like its Her. My dear love i will never have. Why? every time i see a girl i think 3 ways, either she must be in relationship already its worthless to try talk to Her, other way; Oh my She's so pretty and i keep staring at Her deeply with my ""love stare"" and they usually stare as well and it usually ends becouse of bus stops or something, last one, the worse of them all, at the beginning i already think ""Nah, she will reject me anyway im worthless and shit, not even worth a try"" Here is my story, deep down inside i have that feeling that a Girl that would love me as much as i love Her would cure my depression. Any thoughts? Should i even post this garbage here? ","1"

"What I mean by this is, I do plan on trying to get better... but only IF this thing happens to me first and the thing that needs to happen is not very likely to happen. And I can't make myself do this any differently. I'd start taking better care of myself, I'll start cooperating with my therapist, I'll start helping around the house, I'll start making an overall attempt at getting myself to a healthy state so I can live on my own, but again.. I can't get myself to do any of this, unless something happens first. And that something has a 99% chance of not happening. I know people will say, just to do these things before hand whether or not this thing happens, but like I said before.. I can't get myself to do any of it unless it does happen. I have a huge headache, and it's hard to think. That and i'm overall just slow in the head. So this might not make any sense whatsoever but bleh. I need help.

"So I've been struggling on and off for a number of years with my mental health, generally this manifests in me eating and drinking too much, isolating myself when anxiety is particularly bad but on the whole I feel I mask things well and get on with it (I know this isn't heathy either). I have quite a responsible job, I manage people and deal with quite complex issues, it can be quite stressful. I've had a number of issues in my personal life over the years, I've been sexually assaulted amongst other things that aren't easy to deal with. I'm very close to my family and my mother has been sick with cancer over the last 18 months, we thought she was getting better after treatment but this week we found out the treatment hadn't worked so things aren't great.Apologies for the huge spiel above, the reason for posting is I feel I have hit breaking point. Yesterday with the stress around my mother I found myself driving on the wrong side of the road, I only moved over when a car was coming towards me, it wasn't intentional I was just suddenly, weirdly confused. Last night I reached a point I was just scratching at my hand to feel pain and want to do that now again. I have been prescribed sertraline before but been reluctant to take it, Inthink I'm going to give it another go. I'm sorry for this huge moan, I guess I want to know if others have done this, just want to be in bed, getting dangerously confused (me driving on the wrong side of the road) and wanting to cause myself pain (the scratching of my hand). Am I badly depressed? Anxious? Sorry.","1"

"I'm 19 and I started balding when I was around 18. It made me very depressed and disappointed due to the fact that it made me feel like it's wasting my youth. I used to be really happy because I didn't care about how I looked. Ever since I started balding, I began to look and examine my other imperfections very deeply. I started noticing that I have a weak jawline, a slightly big nose, and my lack of tall height (5'8). This obsession of not being able to stop thinking about my imperfections has made me insecure, which is now even giving me social anxiety. Whenever I walk around school, I start thinking about what other people think about me. It's really annoying because I start walking very weird when I have anxiety and it's quite embarrassing.I feel like I lost all of my social skills. Whenever a stranger approaches me and start talking to me, I start getting very nervous and my heart starts beating, and I usually respond with a very stupid answer that shows that I have anxiety.So how can I stop being so insecure? I'd like to beleive that I'm at least a 5.5 - 6/10 but my brain is telling me that being a 5.5 - 6/10 is not even good enough. I just wanna end this social anxiety and insecurity. I take so many videos of myself every day and start looking at my imperfections.I also started browsing r/truerateme and it made me feel like shitSo what can I do to stop being an insecure beta fuck with social anxiety?

"I used them twice before. I regret not using all of them at once. The first time I took them before bed and woke up with generic dizziness headache etc. It was honestly a terrible experience. The second time I went to bed crying after cutting and took about 3000 mg of my medicine. I don't think I'll ever forget the day. I woke up to a splatting noise. At first I ignored it but then I saw a little spider on my bed and freaked out. I flicked it away quickly but kept hearing splatting noises. Eventually I realized the spiders were dropping from my roof onto my bed and got out of bed instantly, threw everything in the wash machine, and tried playing games. But I noticed that I couldn't focus no matter how hard I tried. Everything blurred together and I couldn't keep track of anything I was doing. It kinda sucked because I had a league tournament that day and lost for my friends. But after I have up trying to play games, I went to make tea. My vision was going like crazy. Everything that was far away got closer and farther as I walked, and close things went farther. So sometimes is try grab onto something just to find out it's actually really far away and fall. My legs were also shaking to the point that they couldn't support me. First found out when I collapsed and banged my head. I went around the house on my knees and hands because I also needed to feel where things were since my vision was messed up. I would feel around and then slide in that direction. My heart was really heavy and rapidly beating too so I had a constant feeling of anxiety and panic. But after I made my tea and slowly crawled back downstairs, I just layed on the couch. My brother asked why I was out of my room and I just said I'm bored. I spent the entire day on the couch panicing except for when I lost the tournament. After the day was over I realized the  spiders were hallucination. Oh I also had a constant headache lolBut I still have about half those pills in my room. I really really wish I could swallow them all tonight and be promised death when I wake up. I want to do it tonight but thelast time I did it was just excruciating. I also want to hang myself so much. It seems so easy. But right now I can't. I still live with my dad and really feel bad for him. We've been through 3 different girls now and it all ended the same way. He s 47 now and I think he is just giving up. So he s really miserable because the 3rd just left a few days ago. When I move out though, I promise I'll do it. Nothing gets better everything is boring and my thigh is basically being colored by all the scars.Side bote: Hygiene doesn't help???? I have showed EVERYDAY except for weekends for the past couple years, brushed my teeth everyday since last year and even started doing sit ups and stuff before bed. It really hasn't changed a thing.

"Man no matter how strong you are, life just beats you down again and again. I'm feeling very lonely lately: - I've never had a GF, so this girl I met back in August, on our first date on Oct the 19th I got her some cupcakes and a book she wanted to read when I picked her up at the train station. On the way to drop her at her house I ran over a lady, whom is just fine, got out of the hospital 3 days later. - She stopped talking to me just because of that accident when we've been talking for 2 months, I wrote her a letter every day we didn't talk, 19 letters total. She didn't want them and blocked me from all media. I don't know what I did wrong, besides the event of running someone over, why didn't she stay? Not even after the letters I wrote? Not even after the book or the fact that I've been patient for 2 months to finally go out on a date with her? - She had mood swings on me via text messages even before we didn't meet and I tolerated that.- She forgot my birthday and I tolerated that.- She told me that the way she spoke to me through the phone is how she spoke to everyone, and I tolerated that.- I called her a friend once and she got pissed off, and I tolerated that.

"The suicidal thoughts are not the worst part of the situation Ive been in for the last eight years. Nor is the Crohns disease. Or the anxiety. Or even the depression in general.

I just want someone to give me a hug. To tell me I matter and mean it. And yet, if even if I get those things (which is rare), its not enough. Its never enough. My twisted mind always finds some way to doubt it. Maybe they arent genuine. Maybe theyre just saying that. Why would a person as miserable and useless as me matter in the slightest to anyone other than perhaps my parents?And I know Im not alone. I know hundreds of thousands of people, probably more, feel the exact same way I do. I know I have a family who cares about me. I know I have friends, even though Im not close enough to any of them to talk about this stuff with. I know I have coworkers, and acquaintances, and friendly encounters, and social outings.

A lot.I dont do this when there are other people in the room because I know that there actually isnt anyone there but when Im home alone, or in my room, I pretend there are other people there. I have conversations in my head, I talk quietly so that no one else in my house can hear me but I act as if there are people there with me. Even though I cant see anyone there and I know Im still alone, Ill look to an empty spot on the wall and talk as if theres someone there. The reason I mentioned the stories at the beginning of this post is because the people I pretend are there with me are the fandom characters I write about.

"I've never gone to anyone for help or advice in my life because I've never felt like I had someone to go to so this is awkward for me and I want to keep it short, so this isn't going to be some long story just some sentences that do something I guess. (this part is a lie, I couldnt stop writing)I've always felt like my mom didnt care about me as much as my siblings. She's always saying I'm going to get rich one day and buy her a house and ingrained that into my brain as a child. As I grew older (now 15) I realized more things like that. I'm the only one of my siblings that actually has REAL chores, she always makes her problems my problems, and since I was a kid I've always felt the need to impress her. As I got older I couldn't keep up with her expectations as now I'm always in my room and keep to myself which shes always feels the need to throw in my face. When I cant keep up with my chores she always tells me how lazy and useless I am even though I'm the only one out of my two siblings that do anything. I will never forget one night when I came home from school and was just so exhausted that I went to sleep. Apparently while I was sleeping she told me to take down the laundry and do it (I have my own laundry basket and that basket she was referring to was the bathroom laundry) obviously I was unconscious and couldnt hear her. So at about 8:00 when she sees the basket still in the hallway, she burst into my room and starts yelling at me about how worthless I am and how I cant even do the laundry, she asked why did she even have children when they cant do anything. I get great grades, I do my homework, I keep my room clean, I try to keep up with my chores, but if I screw up just once, she lets me know. It got to the point where I would genuinely be scared when I heard her steps in the halls because I thought she was going to yell at me about something I didnt do.2016 she told me we were moving to a new town despite how much I begged her not to. She was stressed and took it out on me every time reminding me how little I did. On my birthday she didn't get me any gifts which I didn't see as much a problem because I understood she needed the money for the move, but she had the money to buy my brother an Xbox One just a few months later. For Christmas she spent at least $80 each on my siblings while I had a $20 PSN gift card hanging on the tree, I don't know why it didn't bother me at the time but looking back on it sucks. I know it's just materialistic things and I dont really care for those things anymore, but treat you children equally.A year later now that we were in a much better financial situation and moved into a new house I assumed everything would get better which it kinda did. She didn't burst out yelling at me as much but it still happened time to time. So now that my 15 birthday was coming up I wasn't really excited and I didn't know why. I felt awkward asking for anything just because over the years I didnt really receive much. I just generalized thing I would have liked to receive but nothing specific. When my birthday came around I once again didn't receive a gift. I thought it was going to be a surprise or something simple like going to a restaurant or something so I waited. The next day, nothing, maybe one more day? Nothing. And as days turned to weeks I realized I wasn't going to get anything. It may not seem like a big deal but when you see your siblings receiving things all the time and you get nothing, it really sucks. For a while I blamed myself thinking it was my fault for not being specific enough, but come on, at least buy your kid some McDonalds or something, anything at all really. What really got me pissed though was just the next week, she took my sister shopping and spent $150 on clothes while I'm sitting here with the same 8 outfits I've had since 8th grade. Since then I learned if you never ask for anything, which I never do, you'll never owe anyone anything, so hey I guess it's a bit of a learning experience?For a few months after that I tried not to care, and I cant describe it in words because this was years of being kicked down over and over again (metaphorically btw, she never hit me), so eventually you learn that if you dont care about somebody, they cant hurt you. This worked for a while but it was obvious to everyone in the house that I was being cold. I wouldnt talk or eat much, I'd NEVER ask for anything from anybody and I still dont to this day no matter what it is. Her one sided yelling at me turned into mutual arguments. She never realized how many times I walked into my room and just cried. I'd cry in the middle of the day and continue like nothing happened, I'd cry in the morning just before I got out of bed, I cried myself to sleep. I was crying because I knew how much I was being physiologically fucked and there was nothing I could do about it, this is how I will be my whole life, I wont get the chance to experience of feeling loved.One day after some stupid argument I went into my room and cried like usual but this time I didnt close my door and she came in. She said that she was going to kill herself. In the moment I hated myself for being a terrible child, like it was my fault, like I was the bad guy, I felt like shit, but now that I had time to sit and think about it, HOW THE HELL are you going to tell your child that it's THEIR fault that you want to die?? That ate me up for weeks and now not only was my mom putting me down, I was putting myself down. I've learned that if you put a smile on your face and pretend your happy, nobody will question why your sad. I do this all the time and I dont even try anymore, it's just an instinct to smile in every and any situation.Quick side story shortly after we moved into the house. We got a dog. She loved the dog when her boyfriend (technically my stepdad at this point) was around. She used to take out her anger on er boyfriend all the time and I was always the ONLY one in the house who would defend him, she used to get mad when I did but I couldnt help it, I understood exactly how he felt. Eventually they decided to take a break from each other because too many arguments and he moved to Florida for the winter. I didn't realize how much I cared about the guy but when I heard he left I was extremely sad. Now with him gone, she turned to the dog. If you dont want to continue on I understand, skip the next paragraph because it gets really messed up.This is the part where my ""not caring"" turned into hate. First she moved the dog from her room to the basement. A couple of times he would poop in the basement because we were at school and couldnt take him out obviously. She would build up anger for days and wait for the perfect excuse (the dog poop) for a release. She hit the fucking dog, not once, not twice, but every god damn time he pooped. It wasnt even discipline I was just her releasing anger. This truly fucking broke me. I was ok with her yelling at me, but the dog, he's defenseless, she was just pure evil. It got to the point where she build a wall of all the junk we had in the basement to lock him in a corner so he wouldnt poop anymore. I'm shaking just writing this part. I can tell you that it happened a lot when I was in the house, but I cannot tell you how much that dog when through when I was at school. One day when I heard her hit him from my room and hearing his whimper I just couldnt take it anymore, I ran downstairs and we got into one of the biggest arguments ever, which ended with her saying ""I'm the mother of this house, if you have a problem, you can move to the streets and see how long you last"" I moved him to the front porch with a little cardboard house, his bed, and his toys, she wouldnt go in there because she was scared there were mice.He eventually got ticks and lime disease and after taking him to the vet after my sister begged her, she didnt allow him in the house anymore and he couldnt stay outside as much like he used to. He needed extersize, he was a growing dog. One day, he broke a screen in the porch and got out into the woods overnight. He was attacked by a porcupine and had the quills in his nose. We took him to a vet but because my mom didnt want to pay she left him there. The vets saw how sad I was when we left and called her and said we could have him back, she said no. She PROMISED me that she would tell me about what was going to happen to him but yet I heard this over a phone call she had with a friend a week later. How can I trust anyone, when I cant even trust my own mother? I never told her I knew. She took away my family when we moved to a new state, she took away my friends when we moved to a new town, she took away the closest thing I had to a father figure I've had in years, and now she took away my dog. I guess it was for the best, hopefully he has a better home.Just a couple months later (present day) we are moving again. She acts like it's a surprise we cant afford the house despite the fact that I did the math and told her 2 years ago that we wouldn't be able to. The stress has gotten to her again and guess who shes been taking it out on. The reason I made this is because an hour ago she told me she doesnt care about me. I've been thinking about posting this forever now so here it is. I know in the beginning I said it was going to be short but I kinda just started writing and well look what I've gone and did. I was going to ask for help but writing this and sharing it for at least someone else to see has felt good enough. If you read this far, thank you and goodbye.","1"
"I just don't find the answer. I am not ready for this world. The slightest impulses I receive from other people cause my feelings to turn 180. I can not focus, lost in my own head. Nobody has the slightest clue. Just when I get home from school, a switch gets pulled that turns my life off. I have nothing to look forward to, I have no friends. The loneliness I experienced so many years of my life is pressuring my brain with permanent pain. I have got so much love to give. I am crying nearly every day. I cry right now. I am lost in a cycle where is the exit. I am craving for sadness because it marks another valley where it is just going uphill from. When I feel euphoric I just start to count the hours for something to push me down again. Even the awareness about that does't save me. I want to get hit by a bus so no one of my family has to blame themselves. But I also want to wait and see what life has left for me to torment and suffer. I want to suffer, thats what I'm good at.

"Anyone else ever, like, deny their depression? Like, for years, I have had depression, but I didn't really acknowledge it until recently. I would write stories and poems about self-harming and suicide, and I just said I had strong feelings about it.

"This will be really long & I don't expect anyone to actually read it but I truly have never had anyone to talk to about my depression and just need to get it all out there for once. So basically my depression started when I was like 10. I was very close to my grandparents and my grandpa died that year and it literally shattered my whole world. On top of this loss, my mom was married to a man who treated me terribly and was very verbally abusive. I absolutely HATED my life during this time and remember having suicidal thoughts when I was in junior high. Eventually when I was in high school they got divorced and things got better for a while. I still went through depressive episodes but I wasn't miserable all day, every day like I was when I was around my step dad. And then my mom left. So I was 16 and my mom started dating this guy she met on Facebook.... she told me & my brother that she was going to visit our grandma for the weekend and never came home. She called like 2 weeks later and said she had gotten married to this new guy, got a new job and they had gotten a place together. All in a town several hours away from the one where we lived. I took this very hard. I felt abandoned by both my parents (my dad was still in the picture but also moved to a town several hours away as soon as he and my mother divorced. He was in a previous marriage and had a son, who was also in a crappy situation. He fought in court for the rights to my brother and raised him on his own. I always felt like I didn't matter as much as my brother, because my dad knew what I was going through and how badly my step dad was treating me but didn't even try to get custody of me.). I felt like I wasn't good enough. It made no sense to me. Mothers are supposed to love their children unconditionally and have a special bond with them, so I didn't understand how mine could just up and leave me and not think she did anything wrong. After about 6 months of being incredibly hurt and depressed, like bawling every single night, I eventually just got pissed off at my mom and wanted nothing to do with her. My last years of high school I lived with just my brother, since both my parents moved away and left me since it was convenient for them. My brother is great and I loved living with him, but I still kept getting sad for what felt like no reason. My mom used to take Cymbalta and left like 5 bottles of it behind when she bolted, so I started taking those myself. I also started developing a lot of anxiety around this time and would take them when I felt anxious. They made me feel really sick so I eventually stopped, I don't even think they did anything for me. Same story when I moved away for college the next year. I would feel happy sometimes and then just sad for no reason. As bad as it sounds, I would sometimes wish I would get cancer or someone I loved would get killed just so I would have an actual reason to be sad. I also felt really guilty about leaving my brother. I know he genuinely didn't care, but I would cry and cry over it. I felt like he was the only person in my life who had never walked out on me, and then I walked out on him. After my freshman year of college, I transferred to a school 8 hours away. I really struggled to make friends my first semester and was depressed pretty much the entire time. Developed a binge eating disorder and gained like 30 lbs. Toward the end of the semester I started getting really bad about attending class, but was able to end up with decent grades because I had been going in the beginning. The next semester, I joined a sorority and I had a great experience. I made a lot of friends really quickly and was really happy for a while. Then over the summer, I stayed in my college town to work and go to summer school. I became friends with the people I worked with and started hanging out with them regularly too. There would still be the occasional night that I would get really sad and just want to stay in and sleep or cry, but it was less frequent. The fall semester of my junior year, I was a mess. I never went to class. I was in 2 regular classes and 2 online and I ended up just dropping both regular classes because I was failing them. So at that point I was only a half time student. I still had a lot of friends and was having fun, but was getting less and less motivated in school.That spring, my depression started taking over my life. I never went to class but I also always made excuses to not hang out with my friends. I would sleep all day long and stay up all night. I was binge eating again and it was worse than before. I would go through fast food lines and get 2 meals and eat both of them in my car so my roommates wouldn't see how much food I was eating. I hid my binge eating and depression from everyone. We had an on campus counseling center and every day I would lay in bed crying thinking about how much I needed to go there, but I could never get the courage to actually go. School was stressing me out so much and I didn't know how to handle it. I wouldn't go to class because I was depressed, then I would fall behind and school which would stress me out, then I would think about how much I fucked up my school life and would get even more depressed. At the very end of the semester I got out of my funk and somehow managed to get my shit together and pass my classes. I lied to and manipulated my professors to do it, but I did. I was also in a small major and all of the same people in my major were in ALL my classes. I did not fit in with them at all and hated them so much. I had no friends in my major and they were all rude/mean to me during class and group projects. I ended up switching majors to get away from those people. So again after that, things started getting better. I was aware of my depression so even though there were nights I didn't want to go out with my friends, I would force myself to just because I knew I would be sad later if I didn't. I also stopped binge eating, but had already gained another 30 lbs at this point. I hated the way I looked but didn't care enough to change it. By my last semester of college, I felt like I had things back under control. I was doing well in school and I was with my friends constantly. I hung out with them every chance I got because I knew this was the last time I was going to live in this town with all of them. I finished school and all was well. I was also interviewing for my literal dream job. I had applied in November and done 3 interviews for it by the time I graduated. It was a super competitive position and a lot of people applied for it, so I never even expected to make it to the first interview. I made it all the way to the final interview which was in February, and then I didn't get the job. I was literally crushed and felt like a complete failure. It was miserable to make it so far and then not get it. And then things have consistently nose dived since. I got into grad school in another state and originally planned on moving there. I wasn't too worried and figured I would make friends there and life would be okay again. My entire program can be completed online, so I let my family talk me into living at home. By this point my dad had retired from his job and he moved back to our hometown and so I lived with him since my mom was still gone. I HATE my hometown. It's super small, almost everyone here is racist, trashy, uneducated and just overall shitty. I had like 3 friends by the time I finished high school and they all either have babies or are in & out of prison- or both. I've tried hanging out with them a few times, but it's just so awkward because I've changed so much since high school. We took such different paths in life that I can't even relate to them anymore. Before I even applied to grad school, I was told it would take me a year to finish if I went full time and over the summer. Well turns out that's not true. The earliest I'll be able to finish is May 2019. Which means I have to live here another year and a half, on top of the past year I've spent in this shit hole. I cannot find a job here. I'm either overqualified or under-qualified for everything. I've even applied for shitty, minimum wage retail jobs and I haven't even gotten a call back. I've applied at at least 50 places in the past year and can seriously not get an interview from anyone... I don't understand what these people want. I have experience, I have education, I'm not a criminal. Idk why I can't get a job. And I feel like a loser because I don't work. I don't technically need a job because I don't have rent or bills since I live at home, but I have worked all through college and even had 2 jobs every summer since high school so I feel useless without one. And I feel like I'm disappointing my family. They keep telling me to get a job and I feel like they don't believe me when I tell them I've applied at all these places. My aunt even said I was just lazy once which really hurt my feelings. I've barely left my house or interacted with anyone I'm not related to in the last year. I just sit at home all day long on my laptop or sleep. I'm insanely bored and feel so isolated and lonely. I keep going in and out of really bad depressive states where I'm not taking care of myself and literally sleeping for like 16 hours a day. Things have ONCE AGAIN, been looking up. I started putting some effort into losing weight back in October and have lost 18 lbs since. I still have a lot left to lose, but the weightloss has given me something to work toward and look forward to. But I've started developing anxiety about my future. I've never had to be a ""real adult"" and I'm terrified I won't be able to find a job once I finish school. If I do, I'm scared I'll struggle financially and that will just trigger my depression more. I'm also 23 and I'm a virgin who's never been in a serious relationship. I had ""boyfriends"" in high school but they only ever lasted a few weeks and they were never anything memorable. I haven't kissed anyone since 2013... which was 4 years ago. I used to not be fat and didn't have trouble attracting guys, but I was super awkward around them so I never developed any relationships. Then once I started gaining weight, guys stopped paying attention to me. A lot of my friends are starting to get married and I just feel like I'm never going to be able to find love. I'm going to be 25 by the time I finish grad school and I don't even want to consider anyone from my hometown for a relationship. So I'll most likely not even look for a boyfriend until I move somewhere else. So I'm going to be a 25 year old virgin with literally no experience beyond kissing who has never been in a relationship. I feel like even when I lose the rest of my weight I will never be able to establish a good relationship with anyone because my inexperience is a turn off. Or if I do I feel like I'll be like 35 by the time I get married and too irrelevant in all my friends lives to even have bridesmaids. I'm writing all of this because I'm currently in a depressive state brought on by feeling excluded and unwanted by my college friends. I've REALLY struggled the last year adjusting to life after college and I feel like none of my friends have been there for me or even noticed or thought to ask. I was so close to these people whenever I lived in the same town as them and now that I'm gone it feels like I'm old news. I have one group of best friends and all 6 of them are currently in Las Vegas without me to celebrate one of their birthdays. I saw the bday girl posting about going to vegas on Twitter and commented on it, and was ignored totally. Then a week ago she texts me and invites me because someone else dropped out. Apparently she wanted to invited me but didn't have enough room in their Air BnB. I asked my family but they said it was too expensive so I couldn't go. Now they are all there and I keep seeing how much fun they're having while I'm laying alone in my bed crying and it just hurts so much. It hurt my feelings a lot that I was excluded and then only invited as a last resort. And it isn't even because I moved away, because 2 other girls in the group graduated and moved too and they were both invited. I'm literally the only one who was left out. And I don't understand why. Why me? Why am I the weakest link? Why am I always the one left out? It's even more frustrating to me because I'm constantly still doing things for my friends and sending them notes and gifts. I always put so much thought, effort and money into doing things for them even though I'm 8 hours away and I haven't ever gotten anything in return. I don't think I've had a single friend buy me a birthday gift, ever. Idk. It just makes me feel like I always care more about people than they care about me. Being the ONE person left out kind of justifies my depressive and anxious thoughts about being a burden on people or an annoyance to them. I feel so alone, so sad, so worthless and so miserable. I don't know if I can handle another year of this but I don't even know what I can do. I feel like all my life things have kept getting better then worse then better then worse again and that it'll never change.  ","1"

"I didn't realize until one of my friends was talking about sex, but today as of two years ago was the last time I had sex. I'm so miserable about because I have an insanely high sex drive. I've tried and tried to get over my dry spell and can't seem to do it. I thought getting a job and graduating would help, but nope. I thought changing my wardrobe wearing fitted clothing, and changing my hair style would help, but nope. Recently I got a puppy and thought it would help, but nope... (Note: I always wanted a puppy anyway, but still) I'm so miserable about it because I've come close, but either one thing or another it will not happen. I tried going out A LOT, tinder, bumble, bars, texting a bunch of girls on messenger, and sending mass Snapchat messages of my puppy, but it doesn't work. Man I really hate my life, also the fact that ALL my close friends have been in some relationship or had sex for the past two years just seems to rub it in my face more. I mean I love them to death, but sometimes I just hate hanging out with them because it just sucks how they are with their SO or some girl in heat wanting to get them by themselves already. Point is I'm a depressed fuck, and today marks two years if not getting any, and being single as a Pringle, and having trust issues because my last girlfriend cheated on me, I have a shit ton of family issues, and the only reason that keeps me alive is because I support my mom and now have a puppy that I love with all my heart. Lately I don't want to go to work anymore, I just want to stay in bed and do nothing because deep down I know everyone around me is gonna leave soon.my roommate graduates next semester, one of my favorite person to hangout is going 5 hours from where I live for PA school, my other close friend graduates next semester and leaves to Japan... I just have this feeling that soon enough I'm gonna be all alone with my dog, no one will love me, and all I wanted was to have sex, because regardless of people here say it's an amazing feeling, it's not overrated, and I would kill and die to have it again. Sorry if that's not helpful if you've never had it, or try to deny it, but that's the honest truth. Although this may apply if you have a really high libido, which I do, but because of it I've been miserable. I'm just gonna continue drinking til I pass out, and hopefully feel better tomorrow. Knowing my self I'll continue posting next week","1"

"My friend is suicidal and plans to go through with it. I have tried doing everything in my fucking power to stop him from doing it, but in the end I don't even think any of it fucking mattered at all because he's going to do it anyways. I hate myself, and I almost hate him. And I hate that I sort of hate him because he is the one who is considering killing himself right now, not me. I have been trying to talk him out of it, trying to brighten up his day, crying, worrying when I should be studying for my finals, freaking out about losing a good friend, and basically turning into a nervous wreck. I'm starting to think that everyone will just leave me in some way for some reason because I'm not enough. I'm obviously not helping my friend enough, because if I was then he wouldn't be considering killing himself, right? I feel awful and guilty and terrible for even making this post because MY FUCKING FRIEND IS FUCKING CONSIDERING FUCKING KILLING HIMSELF but I just can't help but feel like I am being so god damned drained by this. My grades might suffer. My emotional state is definitely suffering. This is even starting to seep into my other relationships because I'm so worried and irritable and scared. I've cried myself to sleep for the last few nights because I'm probably going to lose a friend to suicide. A good friend, a friend that I feel very close to, a friend that I even consider an older brother of sorts. And I'm just so fucking drained by all of it. A part of me says ""You've done the best you can, and now you need to focus on your education, your future career, your other relationships, and yourself."" but the other part of me says ""Bullshit, you haven't done the best you can because if you did then he would be laughing right now and not crying."" My anxiety is bad enough as it is. He is dragging me down with him, whether he means to or not. Some of my friends tell me to keep him talking, but I don't know how much longer I can even do that. Others tell me to use psychological tools to help pull him back, but they backfire. I just don't know what to do. I don't know what to do.

I dont want to die but i dont want to live and see them together, trying my best to move on, sorry for rant - some of my pals helped me a bit by saying that it was fucked up and stuff but i dont even know i just want to get the hell out of here first chance i get hoping on a college far away and the worst part is he knew how crazy i was about her and he has a gf already i feel it is only to hurt me as he is a  manipulative individual ","1"
"I don't mean to sound selfish or overbearing. I'm just tired, think we all are.When my brother came to my birthday party, he was on his phone the whole time. Maybe looked up a couple of times. Today, I went to go talk to my Dad and I was trying to start a conversation, he noticed something he thought was interesting on the TV and put his headphones on, didn't even say anything to me.I went to talk to my Mom and I sat down and said hi. I tried to talk to her. She doesn't even say anything in response to me, she just types on the computer to her online friends who are more exciting. Doesn't matter that I'm there.On Thanksgiving, I was in the kitchen finishing up something I made. In that time, 15 mins, my whole family ate dinner without me and got up and went off to do something else. They didn't even eat what I made. I really dread Christmas. I was excited about making a special cake for everyone, but I don't think they care about my cakes and they'd probably be more satisfied if I bought one.If I didn't talk to them first, they never would message me. I think I'm really boring. I think they'd be happier if I just disappeared, or maybe if I just stood in the background and didn't say anything.","1"
"I have a 'very important and urgent project' to do at work. It involves managing and organizing a bunch of sub-projects and people. But instead of letting me do it the way I want and have done dozens of times and could easily do on a spreadsheet - that I worked late 2+ un-paid hours last night to set up. Today the owner wants me to use some new project management software because ""it will look better to the client"". So instead of actually doing any work, I'm learning how to use new software, reading and watching tutorials that I have to reread and rewatch because my fucking ADHD makes learning new shit hard. I've now got the presure of doing a challenging important task in ""rush"" situation - and now with a greater likelyhood of failing as I stumble through this new shit.

"I've been severely depressed all my life, and even though I'm a functioning adult (employed full time, in school, married), I feel like I'm at the end of my rope.  I feel like any little thing can set me off, and today something pretty trivial almost did.I sat on my couch all morning bawling my eyes out, thinking about how much of a fuck up I am, how nothing I do is right, no one appreciates me, I'm better off dead but scared to actually do it.  Then my husband gets home and flips out about me crying.  He's sick of seeing me depressed, and I understand that it's frustrating for him.  But swearing at me, saying that I'm my own worst enemy, saying ""fuck you"" to me doesn't help.  He got angry that I couldn't speak to him about what was wrong in between sobs, which made me sob harder.  I can't talk to him about it without feeling berated.  I see a therapist, and there has been little progress. I feel like I get worse and worse and am afraid that nothing will ever get better.  It has been 20 years of this deep sadness.  It's never going to go away.","1"

"I have done some research Googling but Im still ignorant about it but it seems like I have almost everything that goes along with depression including suicidal thoughts. For all of high school, I believed I didnt really have it because I thought everyone in some form has those thoughts and that I wasnt really depressed since I could still crack jokes and make people laugh,I have good people who call me their friends and my parents are making good money so I never have reason to complain about my situation at home but Im not too sure anymore. I first questioned it when Robin William died because while my jokes would never be comparable with the ones Robin told; I saw myself like him where I like to make other people happy by laughing and a person like that I thought would never have those thoughts on his mind until his death. Another thing was I thought my general sadness was from the fact that I was without a girlfriend in high school;it almost became the reason for my existence and once I got one in senior year,nothing changed at all. When it was good I felt the same and when she cheated on me I was angry on the outside but inside it just felt the same and after we broke up I was in the same spot I was in before emotionally. I told myself the feeling would go away after a good one because the last one was just a fluke but thinking now,I wouldnt get back together with my ex,no SO would just magically pull me from this. The last thing was when one of my friends started posting on Snapchat about her problems and I talked with her about it and I notice a difference between us; after like two days she dropped the stuff she was talking about and hasnt mention it since. Its been like a month or two and the only things she sends now are her out and about and with her friends. I on the other hand has been feeling like this since 6th grade and while I have moments where I dont think of it;it always comes back after that 10 second or 2 minute time is up. I never hope I would ever say I was depressed for attention either so I only told my mom,brother and my best friend from high school who thought it was funny which enforces the notion I wasnt really but then again reddit is a popular site where something on r/all has more upvotes than people I dare know in my lifetime so idk what Im really aiming for here. In reality my family and friends and my lack of courage might be the only reason why Im here right now but then again my friends would never believe I was truly depressed and my brother thinks Im just going along with trends that depression is edgy or the kill myself jokes similar to like me_irl which its hard to tell if its just jokes or jokes made in denial. I have never try to kill my self but theres been many occasions where I discarded my safety with my fingers cross that something would happen but my family and friends would never know about that its too small to remember. Theres also a stigma against mental illnesses which brother flat out admits its hard to believe someone close to him has but I seen a stat that 1/4 American has a mental illness of sorts and my nuclear family has four people and my parents and brother are normal in the head which honestly is the weakest part of my argument;but Ill call it an argument because I actually believe I am depressed but everyone else disagrees and its hard to decide who to listen to because who should understand my mind better than myself but then again I never really value my input/opinion to begin with.

"I live on a 1st floor so it was really close. A car hit a person really hard, I'm suprised the person was still alive when the ambulance came, although they reanimated him for quite a long time. I heard a huge noise and I saw an aftermath - didn't see the injured person, by I saw car driver trying to escape by forcing an entry to a random cab and a guy pulling him out of the car GTA style. I hear sirens all the time now. I saw some accidents before and I felt umm...kind of uneasy after each of them but now I really can't shake it off, and constant sirens arent making it better. I'm not really panicked but my heard is beating faster and I need a company. Normally I'm quite talkative and like to go into details but I need to share this asap so I'm not going into details of what happened right now, although any questions are welcomed. English is not my first language and it's possible I'll make some spelling mistakes when I'm nervous.This car driver's panic and ugh... it seemed like he was completely out of his senses. He thought he killed a man I guess.

"I'm 20, going to my second year of university, and I've got no friends. I can't make new friends or maintain friendships with the ones I had from high school. My social skills are non-existent, a problem which has not only affected my social life negatively, but my professional one too. I'm too anxious to go speak to my professors, too shy to join any clubs or events, too scared to try and reach out to others. This negative feedback has cycled for the past four years, and I don't think I can escape it. I'm ugly, physically, and this fact alone is root of my social anxiety.   I hate myself, everything about myself, and my external appearance is the first domino in the chain. There have been days where I would cry for hours on end, thinking of my future, and how lonely it looks to be. Making a connection with people is exceedingly difficult, and at this point, I'm about ready to throw in the towel and stop trying all together as all my efforts thus far have not resulted in anything meaningfulI have not yet had any romantic relationships with anyone. I can't love myself so I don't expect anyone else to either.I'm slowly loosing any motivation to pursue my interests or hobbies. Life just seems so meaningless without people to share it with. That being said, I couldn't have asked for a better family. They're the reason why I haven't, and can't, kill myself. I don't want to hurt them, although I do think their lives would've been better off if another child had been born other than me.Fuck this life. Fuck my appearance. Fuck this crippling social anxiety. Fuck these thoughts. I just want to be loved and cared about, selfish as that may sound. ","1"

"It's been 10 years. I was 15 when I first got depression. And for years and years, I fought it and tried to have a normal life. I fought so hard to work full time, go to university, support my SO. But I kept falling short, having mental breakdowns, and leaving jobs. I finally decided today that I'm going to stop fighting it.No, I'm not going to kill myself. I'm going to accept that my life might never be the normal life I've always wanted. I'm going to be moving to a smaller house. I'm in a casual work position so that I can work as much or as little as my depression and anxiety will let me. My SO is going to be getting a respectable promotion, and has agreed to become the breadwinner (so long as I use my spare time to keep myself as happy as I can.) I don't know what that means yet, but it could mean anything. Volunteering. Art. Music. Dog walking. Writing. Music lessons. Anything to help me from feeling like hurling myself off of a bridge.I know what a lot of you are thinking. ""Fuck this guy. He just gets to do whatever he wants to because he has someone to help support him."" Or, ""You can still do things you enjoy? You must have it easy."" Well, this isn't what I want. And maybe I can still do things I enjoy sometimes, but that doesn't change the running suicide commentary going through my head.  I want to go to work. I want to make lots of money and have a nice house. I want to be respected as a hard working person who contributes to society.  But my brain just isn't letting me. And as stupid as it sounds, I still think that the standard 40 hour work week with kids and a nice house is a waste of a good life...like I'm sure a lot of you think. But I still want it at the same time. It's funny how depression can make you feel like that. I don't want to be like everyone else, but I also do.Oddly enough, my SO is the exact opposite of me. She can't handle being at home on her own. Her depression explodes. She used to work in a seasonal trade, and would completely shut down when she was off in the winter. She breaks down when she's home alone on her days off. She has to be with friends, or doing something with me. It's kind of disgustingly perfect in a way. A lot of you are probably still snarling at me for having a seemingly great situation, but I can assure you that I'd love nothing more than to pluck this screaming illness from my head and move on. I don't like being suicidal every day. I don't like having crippling hypochondria. I don't like being scared to go into public. This is my nightmare, but I'm going to do my best with it.Part of me is relieved that I'm finally just accepting it and doing what I can, but part of me is absolutely distraught that it had to come like this. I feel like the special kid who could only come to class a couple days a week because he wasn't physically able. Except I feel like I'm worse because it's all in my head. I fucking hate it. But it's the only thing I can do right now.So yeah, I'm pretty damn lucky that I have this option. To work as I can. Of course, it comes with certain sacrifices. But I still have the option. It's weird though, because up until now, I thought ""man up and live like everyone else"" or ""kill yourself"" were the only two options. I guess I only have my SO to thank. That being said, I've had a tough couple of months, but dedicating half of my time to enjoying life, doing therapy, and learning new things has made the tough days worth fighting through. I'm letting the depression win, but I'm also boxing it in with the tools I have available to me. To be quite honest, if I didn't have my SO, I'd likely be doing this out of my parents basement. Or dead. But I'm using what I have.It's sobering and heart breaking to admit that you're a lost cause, but it can also be liberating. Heck, I might turn 30 and lose this depression all together, as unlikely as it is at this point, but for now I need to build my life around it. Because the other way was not working.I know not everyone is in the situation I'm in and that the world isn't built for people with brains like us, but I want to encourage everyone who has an idea in their head of what they wish their life would look like to try and come to terms with the fact that maybe you need to build a new life around what you have available to you. I spent every year since High School desperately trying to fit into this mould of a standard citizen, a mould that I HATED, but felt pressured into. Well guess what? That's never going to happen for me and I'm ok with it now. And I'm willing to do whatever it takes to adjust my life to it. I'm sure a lot of you are already past this stage too. Sitting in your parents basement or on social assistance. Or maybe even in my position. As to where we go from here, I'm not sure. But we can be there for each other at the very least. If anyone needs a friend, my inbox is always open. ","1"

"I'm one of those persons that can easily create new ""friendships"". I can get to a new environment and build a vast network within days.

Rather than having quality friendships, I have quantity.I know everyone, but I don't really know anyone. And everyone knows me but no one really knows me. Even when I do form a ""core"" group of friends, I resist the idea of relying too much on anyone. Recently, I was starting to have a ""best friend"" but at some point I felt I was connecting too much with her and relying too much with her. So out of the blue I shut her out.

"(Disclaimer: This is essentially a rant. You probably won't care. I just need to talk somewhere, this is mostly a bunch of mindless babbling and complaining.)I'm not living the life I should, and I don't know what's wrong with me. I always get myself into fights I don't want to. I've inadvertently ruined friendships so badly that it sabotaged my reputation. I can't make or keep friends well and I've heard people only pretend to like me. I know I'm a fat lazy shit, everyone tells me so. I want to turn my life around, I really do. I just have zero motivation. I yell about how I want to go to the gym and get in shape. Guess how that's turned out. I say I want to go out more, but do I reach out to anyone to hang out? Not at all. I depend on my fake ass 'friends' to reach out to me (which happens about once in a blue moon). When I do go out, I totally lose control and act like a moron because the rest of my time is spent alone. I always end up wanting to go home within a few hours, and then crash hard. I'm probably just an introvert in denial, but it's the only time I feel truly alive. All I do is sit inside and masturbate and play video games and eat. I may leave the house once for some non-necessary (ie. not school or related things) once, maybe twice, and that's a good week.It doesn't make sense because I'm not always sad. Sometimes I'll go days at a time feeling fine, but then drop hard and spend the next couple days in a pit. It's practically a cycle. My feelings seem to manifest themselves as anger and hostility, I'll snap at people for damn near anything and need to control myself to ensure I don't. I pick fights I shouldn't. Yet despite this, I have low self esteem (yet, as mentioned before, skyrockets to being extremely egotistical around others, likely just hormonal teenager shit) and low confidence. I'm the most pessimistic guy anyone could ever meet and nobody can stand to have serious conversations with me because I'm so negative. I'm selfish, I'm hypocritical, I'm insensitive. I speak before I think, and it causes me loads of problems sometimes. I even think I'm an aspie, just to put salt in the wound.I dwell on the past. Every mistake I've made, every little superficial thing I've done wrong, I'll dwell on. It'll take me far longer than it should to accept nobody is perfect and that everybody does stupid things from time to time. For the few significant things I did, I never forgave myself for. It's been months, and I don't see it changing. I'm self critical and criticize others yet I'm sensitive when anyone says anything to me. I can't handle criticism, I take it as an insult. My mood changes so easily, yet I'm also extremely apathetic at the same time. My emotions have control over me. I don't make sense, I'm such a hypocrite. I fear my secrets will get out and I'll be totally ruined and lose everyone I still hang on to now. Does anyone even really like me, or are they just using me when they have nobody else to talk to? I doubt everything and everything so much, I even lost my religion as a result. How could some all seeing, all loving, all knowing God allow these miserable things to happen in the world?I even almost lose my job often because I'm so lazy and absent minded and I forget things or just don't want to do them or whatever else. He's picked up on it, and if he wasn't as lenient as he is I'd be long gone. At the rate I'm going, I'll amount to nothing but a basement dweller, and the worst part is I refuse to blame myself, even though I'm the obvious reason behind my problems.I just don't know what my problem is. I have a good life, good family, no money concerns, nothing to be depressed over. What is wrong with me...","1"
"First off, just wanna warn you this post is long af so bear with me. Any straight up advice would be appreciated.Just for a little background, I am 19(m) and have recently dropped out of university after only 2 months because I realised I made a rushed decision in picking it. Since then I have almost demonised the thought of going to university even if it were for another course. Of course this has left me with a year out which in many ways can be refreshing and useful in picking up on experiences for work and sociability. Yet at the moment I am constantly paralysed by thoughts that even getting out of bed is a challenge. I am awaiting checks for any conditions relating to anxiety and depression.I have been going through depersonalisation which is very scary to me. The feeling of waking up not knowing the world as it is, feeling like a spectator to your physical self. I have been able to find a hunger for success in my life but at the moment this is blotted out by the sense that nothing feels real and lacking connection to the outside world. My social anxiety has become very intense recently but Ive always had a desire to be sociable and open to others because Ive always wanted to have plenty of friends. I have been able to control it for months at a time but it doesnt help now that its become worse again. Distancing behaviour is also present which worries me because I have close friendships which are hard to take interest in when you feel empty as fuck. One of my best friends is at a local uni but I see him from time to time as he lives a minute away from me - even this feels isolating because Im too overwhelmed by my thoughts. Feels like Im sinking in wet sand while Im watching everyone walk on. Really kills me.Strangely I have lost all interest in activities which is quite offputting when it comes into mind, but that doesnt stop me from doing them. I have started to gym 2-3 times a week and do badminton every Monday night - even then I feel like Im sleepwalking through everything and nothing is actually happening. Playing pool calms me down too, Id love to take on a sport competitively to keep me occupied.Admittedly I spend too much time on technology. For years I have spent my free time alternating between education and just gaming and mindlessly scrolling through the internet - something which I feel is a stigma for why I feel so empty especially at this point in life. I have not had any family issues in life (unless sibling rivalry at a young age counts).I have never experiences relationships, although I have been involved in situations with girls a few times. At the moment I would still be able to show interest in girls but never really feel a sort of connection beyond that as with anyone really. I feel like my mental problems have blocked off the idea of pleasure including relationships as Im too overwhelmed with my thoughts of finding a purpose.Socially I have been quite disconnected and very weirdly it feels like its ireelevant to me. This I would put down to depression because there have been plenty of times where Ive felt an urge to socialise and I had no problem meeting new people at college. I go out clubbing from time to time but i always end up zoning out into my own world of pain, I can never connect myself to the present. Despite this people say Im mature and can speak very fluently despite not feeling like this is the case. Also, simple concepts such as friendship feel non existent to me - one of the consequences of the forgetfulness I live through. Best way to describe my anxiety is its almost like Ive been reborn in every way and have no idea how to live. And that really scares me.As of now, the best way to describe myself is I feel alienated and lost. The world appears a completely foreign place to me and I fear a lot about the future (Ive come to an assumption this is one of the other reasons for me feeling depressed). I have low self-esteem and have been beating myself down about everything recently. I find it hard to process information which is tiring, but against all odds I did manage to pass my driving test in August first time. A lot of days I feel very lonely yet I cant help but isolate. As hard as it is to see the way forward amongst the fogginess that is my brain atm I have always maintained a strong interest in creative media and would like to start seeing sense in life in the present so I can live with clarity and happiness again rather than dreading on autopilot mode. I am living at home with my parents and my sister, depression makes me overlook the appreciation I should feel having a roof above my head - yet i still beat myself up because I feel like I should be experiencing life like a uni student should be at this age. Maybe its just a matter of loneliness rather than having to party every weekend at 19, its such a small thing when you think about it yet I feel suicidal when I realise Im spending more time dwelling on the lives of others my age than trying to sort mine out... pls tell me thats absolute irrational.Recently I have been lapsing in and out of intense anxiety and this relates to worries of not being able to create a good future and ending up underachieving. Basically one thought resulting in another thought - times this by 500 or 600. I want to seek help but everything has become so distorted that I sometimes question whether my life is worth living - does this mean decluttering before pursuing my career?I feel bad about myself and the fact that I dont have a thicker skin but when youre in such a state its so difficult to think logically even if starting off. I never want to disappoint my parents but hope is so thin when you go each day with a constant internal pain that not even close ones can understand. I just feel like a living zombie and my thoughts always tell me Ill never be able to climb out of the hole. (in short, depersonalisation, anxiety, possibly depression, hopelessness, lack of motivation is drowning out my desire to go and achieve and Im not sure how to cope). As of now I go one day feeling ok and actually find motivation to do small tasks, the next I could feel suicidal and end up sitting in all day isolating myself - I really hate this and doesnt define me at all. What makes me think Im going insane is when someone speaks to me - my disassociative state becomes emphasised and once again this creates a new spiral of thoughts. My friend told me Im just overthinking which makes sense in some ways but I still feel suicidal some days.I hope to go travelling around Europe and apply for an apprenticeship next year (maybe with the BBC), I would love to start a YouTube channel as this involves techniques I learnt at college, also I would love to continue on with media whether its television production or editing. But for now my goal is to rediscover my well-being and see life in a positive perspective so I can wake up one day actually knowing who I am physically, spiritually, and identity wise.  Im here on this earth in my own body. Small steps, but each one to better myself in some way. I want to break away from the spiral of living in fear and worry over every small action I make. At the moment I am in fear of the world and myself for reasons which I can not pinpoint but I want to reach a stage where I can lift myself out of the hole and keep rising. Sorry for the long ass post, Id be surprised if youve made it this far ;) Even as Im typing this now my mental state cant even acknowledge what reddit is. So bad I know. Like Im trapped in a hench-ass bubble around my mind. If you have any advice or questions please let it outIf you need anyone to speak to about interests or whatever your mind can think of, dont be afraid to drop me a message... stay positive :)(In short: Im going through anxiety and depression which has got me in a state of irrational overthinking and feeling constant fear. I still feel a drive to succeed in life but also being dragged into a spiral of depression no matter how hard I try. DP/DR making me feel super paranoid about everything. Always have a desire to get back on track but am in a state of total confusion and worry...)","1"
"This is essentially where I'm stuck. I know I'm not good. I'm ashamed, deeply, of almost everything I've done or said over the last 15 years. I regret most of my decisions. I'm worthless, and the fact that I'm completely alone confirms it. I'm better by myself where I can't fuck anything up or hurt people.How do I recover from soul crushing sadness knowing that this misery is what I truly deserve in life, and that every decision I've ever made has led me here?","1"
"I've been depressed for years now, with ups and downs. But recently it has been getting worse. I easily lose my temper and I just don't feel like doing anything. Most of my days I spend crying or feeling down. And i just want to be all by myself. I just lost all hope and I'd honestly just can't take it anymore. I don't want to end my life but it scares me that I feel I just might one of these days. I wished I could just wake up one day and not feel anything or just feel happy.....","1"
"This may a really long ramble. I apologize.I know I'll get comments saying ""I care! Talk to me!"" But that's not what I mean. My whole family knows about my depression. I've told my mom and one of my sisters that I think about killing myself all the time. None of them ever mention it. I never get a ""hey, are you ok? want to talk?"" from either of them. They simply don't give a shit. My mom used to, but she rarely talks to me anymore. I'm 28 with three younger siblings, and I guess she stays too busy with them to worry about what the fuck I'm going through. We set up a time to go to lunch together once a week, which lasted a few months, but now she cancels more often than not (right now we're at 3 weeks in a row) because she's got other stuff to do. My dad has never asked me how I'm doing. The only time we've ever talked about it was years ago when I posted a facebook status about being depressed. In that post, I used profanity. He replied to me telling me that using that kind of language offends my younger siblings. That's the only thing he's ever said to me about it.I make it a point not to bother my family with my problems, to the point sometimes of not even coming around for weeks at a time.I don't have any friends. My best (and really only) friend through high school and college got married and moved an hour away, and now we rarely speak. I've tried, but people just don't seem to take an interest in me. I lent one of my ""friends"" in college $500 to pay his bills. He was grateful and paid it back, but that was it. Rarely spoke to me before or since then. Basically just used me as a loan officer.I'm now to the point where the selfishness and underhandedness of people has made me hate the whole human race.I've never been on a date. Every girl/woman that I've asked has given the ""I've got something else to do this weekend"" excuse. That happened all through high school and college to the point where I just gave up. I haven't even tried to get anyone in 6-7 years. By the way, none of them give a shit either.I hate my job. I'm a software developer and I feel like I'm drowning every single day. I read an article every day about the next new technology/programming language/framework/etc. and it just mentally drains me. People around me have a passion for it, and I'm just trying to get through my work without crying. I feel like a total failure at my job, and even if I didn't, I don't have the passion or the desire to learn anything new or to excel at it. The problem is there isn't anything else that I want to do. I have no hobbies, passions, nothing. When I leave work, I go home and watch TV. On weekends, I sit on the couch and watch TV. That is literally my life. Guess what? No one gives a fuck about that either. I've had therapists (and my mom) ask me ""What do you want to do?"" and ""Start looking for another job"". I want to shout at them ""WHAT JOB? I DON'T WANT ANYTHING ELSE BUT FOR MY LIFE TO END!"" None of them get it. It's almost like it's a given for them that I should, by default, have an interest or desire in something and that's what I should pursue. They either don't understand or don't care enough to give me a useful answer.I don't know what else to say. I'm pretty sure my life is going to end soon. Like, within the next 6 months. There is no escape from this. This life is a grinder, and the only way to avoid being pummeled into dust is to hop off early.","1"

"Im in a bad situation. Im a freshman in college, and after a recent break-up with my boyfriend, I have realized that I had no other friends. He ended it with me, and Im still very upset. What do I do? Are there any people on here whove been friendless before and can explain how they got out of it? I want advice to keep in mind before I start the spring semester.Background: Ive always had borderline antisocial tendencies. I was a loner in high school. I have a tendency to serially date in order to always have an emotional support system due to my lack of friends.I am very mistrustful of other people and tend to assume the worst (theyre only talking to me because of X, That thing they said must have been passive aggressive, theyre only interacting with me to take pity on me, etc).I have very low motivation and have trouble taking initiative.My friendlessness is something Ive taken for granted, because in high school, the longer schoolday occupied my time, so I was usually too exhausted by the time I got home to have wanted or been able to do much anyway, and because I was much closer to my siblings back then. But now that Im in college, its really starting to hit me. I need somebody to hold me when Im shaking, or to talk to me when Im crying, but I have done nothing to deserve it, and am all too aware of it. My dorm is a complete mess, and Ive started to forget to eat/only eat things that are easy to eat. I found myself intentionally bruising up my arms against the frame of my bed. I feel like my life is going downhill and spinning out of control, and I dont know who to talk to or what to do. I feel like a pitiful little creature. ","1"

I wake up every day with a nauseated pull in my stomach wanting to go back to sleep. At night I dread going to bed because I know I will be laying awake long enough to let my mind dive into dark places I cannot escape.I spend 100% of the time with myself, but I dont know who I am. I know I am cynical, I have a lot of anger and hate. Maybe it is there to cover the pain that slowly consumes my soul and will lead me to the end of the rope.This surely cannot be how life is supposed to be? I cant take this anymore.","1"
"I used to be very sociable and most importantly funny too. Now I feel like I don't make alot of jokes and 9/10 times they're about suicide.

I used to be one of the more populair guys and now I am quite forgetable. Whenever I am at parties I just sit there uncomfortably don't really go out talking or make jokes because I've just lost it unless I am really in my zone/am comfortable. ","1"
"I'm not popular but I'm quite empathetic. I can understand other's situation/feeling well, I could manage to make some friends with this....skill??? Though they didn't like me, they just wanted to vent something.My other family members are cold, cruel, unempathetic. I don't understand, isn't this usually genetic?Anyway, both my parents were raised in abusive household, they are full of anger, coldness with cruel hearts. My older brother is kinda psychopathic.I'm the youngest, but I always should be the one who endure everything and console others. I had to cheer up my parents while they didn't have ability to do that. Aren't parents supposed to do that for their child? Not the other way round?Friends or general people too.I realized people are generally suck at imagining themselves in other people's shoes, oh that's why I could make some friends. Because no one listens to them like I do. Even my therapist liked chatting with me, saying that I understood what she was talking about very well, session with me was not difficult. (English is not my tongue, in case you think my writing sucks)But when I opened up about myself to others, told my problems, friends and colleagues all ran away.All of them ran away. Not one left since then.Recently one of them invited me to her wedding, I didn't go there.I'm now broke, don't have money to buy not the cheapest gift, didn't wanna meet school reunions there, and, .........I don't think we were actually friends.I'm emotionally unavailable, depressed, have my own problems, how come I always end up being the one who should understand others and comfort/cheer up them?Why is life so unfair?

"Like me, most of my fellow interns have recently graduated from university this year. That also means we're all on the hunt for full time positions. Some early on landed jobs, and gradually over time many more did too. Besides the interns who are still in school and the couple decided to remain interns into the next year, I'm the only left with no insight on what I'm going to do.Now don't get me wrong. All of my fellow interns are beyond deserving of the positions they landed. I'm truly happy for them.Thing is, though, I'm even amazed I landed this internship in the first place. I already suffer from major depression, and have had (and still do) little to no confidence in myself and abilities. I have no motivations, little energy to do anything, and have little redeeming qualities.All of that is amplified when you see your co-interns leave for full time positions. I feel like shit because my life and anything about me is garbage.

"Just as the title states, I was wondering if anyone else had this happen to them, I know it's probably the case, but I'd still like to ask.&nbsp; I'm normally very good at hiding my emotions, especially when I am feeling down; But sometimes it becomes too much to hide.&nbsp;Today was one of those days; Even self-talk proved to be completely ineffectual.&nbsp;I think it's the hardest for me, because not only did it happen at work, but it was obvious to everyone. (i.e., ""You don't seem like yourself today. You normally have a bit of pep in your step! You're usually chirpy, and very energetic/spunky). &nbsp;Even my boss had something to say, she stopped me right before I left the building, asked me to smile, said it was ""Ok"", and that she ""Didn't know what was wrong"", but ""Wanted me to be happy"".

Or is the person they talk about me?"" It really does make me wonder, possibly even doubt myself. Is the medicated, self-talking, peppy-happy person me?

"Hello everyone i will try to keep it short. I have depression and i was prescribed with escitalopram and olanzpine BUT after a couple of weeks i noticed that i became much dumber ,to the fact that i had to abandon my masters degree.However i kept the medication for 1 year and then i cut it of abruptly  because to tell the truth i didnt like the doctor and i wanted to leave. I was off meds for 3-4 months and still the symptoms didn't go.And i switched to a doctor that i really like, he prescribed me fluoxetine and rhisperidone ,i took them for 1 month BUT after a while i noticed that i started to develop severe memory problems to the point where i can't remember what i studied yesterday,even though i studied hard.Anyhow i had to stop the fluoxetine because i am allergic to it.And i have a new prescription on the way.My question is,does anyone know what is happening??I want to start a new masters program and i think i am doomed to fail.

"Hi everybody, Ive a question for those who may have experience with various anti-depressants and/or supplements, which is probably 99% of readers here. In the next paragraph Ill briefly describe what I take and how meds make me feel for background info. If you want to skip straight to the question, go to the third paragraph. Ive been taking Bupropion xl 300mg, and Viibryd 20mg. Never had issues with Bupropion except that the very pronounced positive effects it has stopped after about a week after beginning to game it. In my case I had take it in the past but for less than a year. This happened each time after start of the prescription.  Viibryd doesnt have stimulating effects I could feel but it definitely does not have the sedating effects of SSRIs. I am talking about how when they begin working they do take away intense worrying and depression but also , at least in my case, they reduce motivation to do random things that may be called fun optional activities like going outside or playing video games. That in addition to increased sweating is why I choose to not take standard SSRIs and instead asked something without demotivating effects. Viibryd really does seem to not have any side effects, but its intended effect is weak so far as well. The question is about a problem Ive felt for a week now. I didnt stop or reduce meds I am taking, but my mind feels as if the motivation to do things I cognitively understand I should be interested in is very weak or gone, and it causes me to have a sensation that some areas of my brain may be working at less than 50% capacity. I cannot say I feel dumb as I am able to do all the Norma mental tasks, but the ability to focus on them and actively think and analyze goes away when random or tangential thoughts take over. I can even get some more concrete idea that the mind is not at full speed when I play some competitive board games either against the computer or against people online. I can see evaluations of each move and game outcomes. Theyre displayed on a graph where I can see 2-3 years back of daily play, for example. Any idea what could be causing it, or how to shake it off?

"I was watching a comedy show, just laughing like I didn't went through a depression at all. I stopped taking my meds few weeks ago because I already felt better. As I went to grab a can of beer in the fridge, I saw my bedroom door open so I entered. I sat on my bed for a moment and everything suddenly becomes so silent. So empty. Thinking ""I'm laughing alone... again"" It felt like I'm cheating myself. Loneliness suddenly cuts through my bones, adding the fact that I'm living alone in this apartment. I broke down.

"Look at me, capitalising on my misery on reddit.Went into work feeling really down, and it sucked when I had to interact with my colleagues and customers (I work in a cafe and there's no room for introversion or avoiding social interaction). My manager commented that my performance has slipped lately and that my mood has been low, and when they asked me what was wrong, I started crying as I tried to explain (not often you see a grown man cry). I mentioned that I was feeling depressed and that it's starting to make the job and life harder, but I think they interpreted it as meaning that I'm finding the job stressful. However, they gave me an employee helpline to ring, and they mentioned that they'd talk to someone higher up in the company.It's not that the job is too stressful for me--it's that my low mood is making the job stressful. I don't want to talk to people, but I have to. It's so draining being positive and chirpy when all you feel is self-hatred and depression.I'm at the absolute lowest point I've ever been right now. Even the gym is hard to go to now. ","1"

"Not sure why I'm even writing this cause I'll likely delete it. Constantly feeling hit with shit. Just feels like non-sense and is denigrating. All day long I actually thought about shooting myself in the heart. I feel like my discussions with certain individuals in charge of me are falling on deaf ears. Being in the military and in college is at times stressful to say the least. I talked to my first line leader who just happens to be the LTC and he basically told me to be less stressed about grades cause ""C's get degrees"". I have asked for the ability to not go to our annual formal event. The reason I don't want to go is because we have ""skits"" but I have seen the ideas for some of the skits and guess what favorite punching bag is the center of one set of skits? You got that right me! I am called ""the biggest fuck"" in my battalion. People like to use me as a punching bag, but then come to me when they need knowledge on something they are void in. Waking up at 5 am to have a 17hr+ day and then have individuals make jokes about me is just taking its toll. Don't know how much longer I can do this. ","1"
"Dude the amount of depression I feel right now is ridiculous. How can I cheer up? :( I have work pretty soon too, been tossing and turning in my sleep with anxiety because of that as well. Ugh, i hate having depression and anxiety. ","1"
"I'm 19 and last year I had to drop out of college due to problems with my depression and anxiety, I then moved back in with my mom for a couple months, as my mental health seemed to get worse and worse my mom would kind of threaten me with sending me to a hospital for my anxiety and depression. It was then the last thing I wanted to do. Things kept getting worse however, I started to have panic attacks daily where I would shake uncontrollably and barely be able to breath, anyone else experience that? It's so strange to me that I can like have a seizure over just about anything, my mom would basically yell at me to stop and say stuff like ""you're ok, don't be anxious"" or ""it's ok anxiety isn't a part of you, you can break it"" and stuff along those lines. I started to get these really severe testicular pains that resulted in 4 ER visits. I thought I was dying or something, but all the tests for everything came back negative. Looking for answers I went to my regular doctor who had known me all my life and within minutes she told me the pain was most likely from my anxiety and that I needed to go seek treatment ASAP. I started balling, my mom and gf took me straight to a treatment center and idk how but I felt better after just signing up for a IOP program, it was like admitting I had a anxiety and depression disorder helped me deal with it in a way, my pain stopped. While on the waiting list for the program I moved in with my gf and away from my mom, which I now realize is one of the best decisions I've ever made, I never knew how much my mom was stressing me out on a daily basis till I moved out, I know her intentions were good but the way she went about trying to help only made me feel worse. My gf is so much more supportive and helpful when it comes to my depression than I ever thought anyone could be. After I finally got to go to the IOP program thing I learned so much about what I was going through my whole life and when I was done I finally felt some relief that I had been waiting for. I felt like I was on top of the world, I felt cured in a way, I would occasionally feel depressed or anxious but the coping mechanisms I learned in my group therapy made it all manageable, I applied for college again for something different than I was originally going for, and to a different college that was closer to my new home. I started seeing a therapist and psychologist. I realized what my mom would say to me was the last thing you should say to someone suffering from mental health episodes, I owned my anxiety and depression and made them my bitch. I felt great but then of course everything soon would go to complete shit.I got in a huge fight with my mom and out of the blue my depression and anxiety came back in full storm, I was getting yelled at by mom over the phone and I just started shaking like crazy, my face was twitching, which never happened before when I would get panic attacks and threw up and I think I said something like ""I can't talk right now I have to go"" and hung up, which lead to my mom calling me upwards of 20 times and texting me an unbelievable amount of messages mainly about how disrespectful and ungrateful I was, my gf came home to my just twitching and balling my eyes out on the floor. She managed to calm me down after about an hour and I explained to her what happened and I would get into what the fight was about because I think this post is gonna be long enough but after explaining it to my gf she agreed that my mom was being completely ridiculous over what she was first upset about. But after that I feel like my mental health was 100x worse than it was before the IOP program, my panic attacks came back worse and more frequently than ever before, I still can't even get out of bed until 4 or 5pm, and the fight was 4 months ago, since then I decided I wanted to see a new therapist but haven't gotten myself to call to schedule a new appointment with someone else after canceling with who I saw before, I've been switched on meds so many times I don't remember and all the meds do is seem to make things worse, and I'm going to full on postal if I hear that same damn speech about how it takes time to work and the pills are basically guess and check until they find one that works. I'm frustrated with how little I do all day, I don't have a job and I couldn't get myself to actually go to school for the registration so I guess I dropped out once again. The thought of school just makes me anxious as hell, I've got a friend going into the trades and I've decided that that's what I do with my life but I haven't been able to take any actual steps towards doing it, I do nothing all day but wallow in my own sadness and cry, I constantly have panic attacks that cause me to go lie down for hours my gf complains that she's bored all the time and that she wants to do stuff but I'm so scared to leave the house, I do for her but it's so hard for me, she doesn't seem to understand I gave up trying to explain it. I try the coping strategies that helped me so much before but nothing worked, nothing helps anymore. I feel so foolish, I feel so helpless, I feel so lost in life. I've been lurking on here for a while reading other people's stories I thought I might share my own I guess. I'd be curious to know if anyone else is going through anything similar, things just keep getting worse and worse. Big thanks to whoever reads this, if anyone actually does, I don't know but it means a lot to me, just typing all that out feels good, I appreciate whoever takes the time to read it. ","1"
"So, I'm 23, and I'm very sure that I am bisexual. It's just that, after being very mentally ill for twelve years, I think my parents are tired of my shit. I understand that they've put up with really dumb decisions I have made, my compulsive behaviors, and many suicide attempts. Now they are taking time off of work to drive me to ECT treatments, which I know is hard on them. And, I mean, I'm already embarrassed by my mental illnesses, so I don't know how I'd feel if my parents paraded around the fact that their daughter is attracted to men AND women.

Yesterday I literally took a walk around my work site during break and all I did was contemplate all the different ways to do it, jumping off the top of our dome, or jumping in a screw conveyor, or just jumping in the river.

"Hey everyone!Gender: female (me), male (him). Both 24, been together for a year. I recently found out about a month ago that my boyfriend of one year had cheated on me. I'll keep the story short but we always struggled about his flirtatious behavior towards other women and how it bothered me. He always promised it would never go too far. In the end of July, he called me upset from another country (we work for an airline) saying that he met a girl at the bar and was walking her home trying to be a gentleman and that she kissed him at the door. He says he was so shocked he didn't know how to respond and he froze but that he feels horrible and he's never going to communicate with her again. After he came home, things became very complicated. I learned that I was pregnant, and had an abortion. Right after the abortion, he wasn't very supportive and said he wanted to take a break, but not see other people. I told him if that's what he needed to go do it, but no seeing other people. I found out later on that he met up with that girl again, went to her house, she made him dinner, and they kissed and laid together in her bed. She told me that he made it very clear to her that he didn't have a girlfriend and couldn't because of his job. I also found out from another girl he was talking to that he approached her at a bar, told her she was so beautiful he had to speak to her, exchanged info, and invited her to visit him in NYC. He also had photos of these women and a few others I do not know saved on his phone. My heart is broken. The next day, he came begging for a second chance and promised to change everything. He has since reset his phone and cut off contact with them. I know he is trying and I am trying to forgive as well I am just struggling so hard. I still feel so hurt and betrayed. I keep lashing out in anger at him, I get aggressive and I fight and scream, which is not my character at all. I want so badly to forgive and start fresh because I love him so much despite everything. Is it possible? Or is it too soon? Any advice would be great. Thank you. ","1"

"First I just want you to know that this is probably gonna be, as stated in the title, a quite messy wall of text... There are just a lot of things I wanna vent and some of them don't quite connect with each other, but I'll do my best.Hello. I'm a 24 years old Brazilian male. Currently unemployed and recently found out that I have Misophonia, a mental condition that renders me completely unable to listen to dogs barking without having an instant, involuntary anger attack. Personality wise I think of myself as someone wise and mature, and Im not afraid to admit that because honestly, I worked hard to acquire this knowledge. I'm also quite nice and try to help people out as much as I can. I always try to smile to people when I'm out, because I've learned that a smile can sometimes brighten someone's day a little (or a lot!), and you can even end up getting another friend in the end. However... Recently I realized that growing up to be so nice and wise wasnt as good as I expected itEven at my teen ages, when I was still quite nave, I already had an understanding of what I wanted from people and what I wouldnt tolerate from them. So Becoming wiser than people at my age came out pretty naturally to me. But sometimes I just wish it never did... For one I became able to read people like books. All I need is a quick glance at someone or a brief chat to tell if were gonna be good friends, casual friends or if I rather not bond with them. Sure, you shouldnt judge people by their appearances, and I always try not to. But once you keep seeing always the same patterns The look on their faces, the way they talk, the way they dress, what they like It just becomes really easy to connect the dots and tell that someone wont click with you. And that lead me to become rather lonely myself I do talk to my family every day, and I am in fact nice to anyone who isnt an asshole to me, but I just developed way too many standards over time and those make me unable to find myself comfortable bonding with people that just dwell in their own mediocrity and refuse to change. People who dont appreciate the beauty of small things, who are unable to recognize and value small acts that truly make a friendship shine So in the end its pretty much my own fault for being lonely, and thats fine for most of the time really. Ive done a quite good job at dealing with it over the time. But sometimes it just gets dark, and no one is here for me when Im always there for themThe thing about getting stronger and stronger is that Eventually you become so strong that you dont have anyone equally or stronger than you to comfort you. And that REALLY sucks. You become able of carrying so many people on your shoulders, but you never have anyone to carry you when you need it, even if just for a little bit Getting comfort from people that dont quite understand your position just gets predictable and ineffective with time. Sometimes you just need someone that really gets you and knows the right words to ease your heart, but Im slowly accepting the fact that Ill just be alone forever. Even though I have the lowest of expectations when meeting new people, they always fail me. I try my best to accept peoples defects and value their virtues, but they dont do the same for me Theyre unable to sit down and talk things over when Im the one who messes up. So they just drop everything and leave me.To be fair I think my biggest nemesis right now is my misophonia These angry spasms dont happen a lot through the day, but they do happen every day in fact And when they happen it feels like a spike stabbing my mind and giving me this stupid involuntary reaction. I dont usually blow up in front of people, but I get really uncomfortable and have to retreat to my sanctuary. If I could get a job things would be so much easier Im pretty sure it would even help my misophonia out. But were currently going through an economic crisis and getting a job has been nearly impossible for me, since the companies have to pay your transport to work but theyve been refusing to do so, and employing only people that live close to them. And unfortunately I live far from the region which usually employs, so theres thatI just really miss being able to lie down on my bed and shut down. And wake up the next day and run to work. A lot of the times before trying to sleep my mind just wanders to dark places, and makes it hard to fall asleep On top of that, some days Im abruptly awakened by the neighbors dog, which is just Hellish. Its so bad. I really want my life to get back on track I miss having money to buy stuff. Going out and buying me a yummy treat. Having the energy to focus on something productiveIm sure this will eventually end. It will become just another experience and Ill get even stronger (oh no). But right now This burden is just really weighing me down. I just wanna have peace again and work on my dreams, but all these situations render me unable to do anything but wait And the uncertainty of it is really maddening I know that there are people in situations much, MUCH darker than mine. And while thats somewhat comforting, that doesnt change the fact that this is really wearing me down And having no one to lean over just feels sad and hopeless. But I dont wanna give up. I feel I have a genuinely good heart and I wanna help people find that goodness within them as well. And I dont wanna just throw away all the progress Ive made until here.Thank you SO much if youve read his far. I really needed to get this out of my chest, and I just hope to read some uplifting words. And be reminded Im not alone in this. Have a nice day and I hope your situation gets better someday!","1"
"First of all, I apologise for posting this in here if it's not appropriate - just let me know if that's the case - but I really couldn't think of anywhere else to post it & I suffer from depression so - here goes...I'm going to see a panto tomorrow with my Mum, and I have reason to believe that my estranged step-daughter is involved in it, and I'm terrified of her. She hates my very guts and has been nothing but abusive towards me. She basically turned my lovely, late husband (her father) into a victim of domestic abuse by beating him up twice - the first time he was left with a permanent scar on his cheek, the second she knocked one of his teeth out. She has been diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder. I haven't seen her for 4 years since she turned on me for refusing to give her any money (well, I tried to send her a couple of cheques but it wasn't good enough so she sent them back in a rage & said she never wanted to see me again.)Actually, she never visited me after my husband's death - she arranged at least half a dozen visits but cancelled each one by text message at the last minute... She sent her brother round to ask for money - he was in my house for 3 hours & wouldn't leave. He said it was lucky I was dealing with him & not his sister or it would have been the worse for me. Eventually I got him to go, but I was very shaken.I have Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, CFS and an ileostomy - I couldn't fight her if she went for me - I know she is capable of that. I have also been diagnosed with PTSD since my husband's sudden death & I know her behaviour has been part of that. I even dream about her on a regular basis. I've really only just started to leave the house again properly in 4 years. But I also feel guilty - maybe I should have given her more money. She was my husband's daughter after all and he did love her dearly, I know that. Maybe I should have tried to help her. I was a pretty useless step-mother, I'm sure (she does have a real Mum, who she has also beaten up on a fairly regular basis - she may not be doing that these days - at least, I hope not!) I'm sure none of this is what my husband would have wanted. I should add that she & her brother are both beneficiaries in my Will - it seems only fair - but I haven't told them.I was unable to have children of my own after suffering Primary Ovarian Failure at the age of 17 and failed to go through puberty properly. Tests were run but they couldn't even find my ovaries - it's possible that I never had them in the first place but we don't know. I really feel like I've been left with nothing at times - I know I should count my blessings though.Apologies if this is confused! There is a lot more detail I could go into but I'd better not. I'm just hoping she doesn't spot me at this panto tomorrow because I'm terrified something awful will happen if she does. Hopefully she'll just ignore me. God, I feel so pathetic and useless, and so, so lonely - I've tried hard to get out & about again & I'm sick of feeling so scared all the time. On a more general level, I feel like I must be a really bad person.Thanks for reading!","1"

It started around the April I think.I've always been really motivated and generally happy person with a lot of projects and hobbies (music, programming, videogames, 3D modelling, etc) that I really loved. But this year has been... different. Starting a lot of projects left unfinished, feeling tired and empty a lot of the time, dropped out of the sport I was practicing because I just couldn't go out there and put energy into something, although always suffering from introversion, it was totally worse than before. I never considered suicide a solution to anything though, I strongly believe that I could never do that or even harm myself for dealing with this.Finishing the secondary school two weeks ago didn't help because I already lost almost all connection to my school friends (almost all my friends are school friends, except a few). And a week from now it's my graduation night (kinda like prom but not quite) and I'm already feeling really anxious and the feeling of not wanting to go is growing stronger and stronger, but I'm going anyway because I already payed lots for the invitations and clothes.Also, distance is growing between me and my crush, to which I was really close before, and it just makes me sad.Nowadays, my routine is basically wake up at 1 PM, eating, playing videogames, do some chores, if I'm feeling inspired I might play piano for a while but not too much, and go to sleep.I feel like I don't have anyone to talk to, even though I know I have my family and friends who would be happy to help, but I just can't get enough courage to talk to anyone. I also considered searching professional help, but knowing myself I either wouldn't be able to ask my dads to help me search or I would end up not going because of anxiety.I also am going to start university next year and I feel I don't have the emotional state to start studying and putting myself out there in the world.

"I mean...I do want to die. I'm still depressed and I still have a really hard time putting my life and perspective in any sort of agreeable order.

Like in the void of space or whatever my particles would be pissed. I've always wanted to die! I literally dreamed of having this sort of experience that would just kill me and leave no trace that I ever wanted it. Guilt-free death. However, two hours after downing some DMX/codeine stuff I started having what I can only experience as a terrible terrible shroom trip. My head was pounding and my body was so unbearably heavy. I couldn't keep my thoughts in order and barely made my mouth move enough to warn my boyfriend that I was probably going to die in my sleep and it was nice knowing him. I know codeine makes you trippy but I had like a capful of this stuff. I was laying next to my then boyfriend, having a terrible time as my heart rate went up to an audible beat and the bed was absolutely soaking with my sweat and according to my ex, all the color in my body just left. I was like..fuck dude if this is how i'm gonna die i might as well just live long enough to off myself the way I want! It was a really surprising thought and I even remember thinking things like 'there's so much I haven't done' and 'I want to talk to my mom one last time.'

The child psychologist I saw tacked it up to my home life being rough, abusive father, parents going through a divorce, as well as a few other things.I've dealt with it all my life since, sometimes in short bursts that seemingly happen out of nowhere, other times it's like this constant nagging that just won't stop no matter what's going on around me. I usually keep it in check fairly well, but now he things going on around me are making it so hard to do that, there's so many things I've done wrong and mistakes I've made that it's probably done irreparable damage to my marriage and my kids don't even look at me the same.This last month has been particularly hard. My family and I are about to lose our place to live because our previous property manager has issued a non-renewal letter to the new management company before leaving her position for a promotion with this new company. We're currently on a month to month lease and they just bumped my rent up by nearly $500 dollars compared to what we're used to paying. All the while this is going on, my wife is working full time, and I'm working two days a week because we can't afford a baby sitter for our children so while I'm alone most of the time with my kids, I can't seem to enjoy the time I spend with them at all. She makes more money than I do, so it makes sense for her to work full time and me part time. It was a crappy situation that made me regret a lot of choices we made but it was livable because we were able to keep a roof over our heads, and now we're probably going to be out on the street in less than two weeks.I have the money for the rent now, but I'm stuck in my head trying to decide if I should pay it, or try and find another place to live. If I do pay it then we won't have enough to cover our utilities and our lights will be cut off. That'll give the leasing office grounds for eviction as in our complex you cannot occupy an apartment without electricity. However we have shitty credit and finding a place affordable enough that's big enough for a family our size is nearly impossible. I feel like I'm trapped in my head while all this is going on around me, almost like I'm watching someone else's life fall apart right in front of me and there's nothing I can do about it. I feel sad, yeah, but more than anything I just feel defeated. My friends all abandoned me when we had our first child so I literally have nobody to talk to about anything I'm feeling except her. But that puts such a strain on our already fragile relationship. I just don't know what to do anymore. I'm scared and confused and nothing makes any sense right now.TL;DR: My depression is kicking my ass right now in the midst of my apartment complex trying to get us out. ","1"

"I use to not think about my childhood. Maybe because the present was just as enjoyable as the past at that point in my life. Now I spend my days actively reminiscing about small moments in my childhood. Maybe walking to the park with my mother. Learning how to ride a bike. Playing with friends. Our family vacations. I feel like the negativity I allowed to swallow me whole dampened those memories for awhile but now theyre back and in full color and I cant help but feel my depression triggered by the fact I cannot simply rewind time and feel Ive wasted so much of it making the wrong decisions. I want to take my parents to the beach we went to as a child so Ive been trying to save money for a hotel. I just want to feel careless with them one more time. My father is old and not in the best shape. Who knows when I wont have that opportunity anymore. Is that selfish? Anyway...Im rambling. I dont like the person I see in my reflection so I close my eyes and see that girl before the world tore her apart ","1"
"So the whole story started 2 years ago. I just got into a new class in a new school. Then there was a girl, I had a crush on her and I was pretty sure she felt the same way. At that time I already often was feeling down, so I texted her about it (probably wasnt a smart idea). So yeah, she went to the teacher and after two worthless sessions with a completly inept teacher and a cold principal they called my parents. Now my parents were very nice and their only statement was, that I should stop cutting myself because the scars wouldnt look nice. So life continued and so did my depression. Later i started texting another girl and found out that she also was depressed. So we had some good chats, but it was kind of useless. So I called for help a third time. Nothing. A fourth time. Nothing. One more time. And this last time fucked me over so hard. Basically the last time I texted somebody and she didnt take it that well. She started treating me like shit and was constantly harassing and insulting me infront of everybody.  But that wasnt enough. She had to tell all my classmates and with her version of the story everbody now thinks Im a psycho. This isnt the only problem but, here is the story that lead me to the brink.TL;DR the whole school thinks Im a psycho and an asshole. But if they want to believe that, fine, but Im gonna prove the opposite by either hanging myself in a classroom or shooting myself on the high school certificate party or whatever its called.And to specify: I take the blame for this situation, at least a big part of it. I shouldnt have texted them.","1"

"I couldnt see at the time that I was afraid of letting people in. I thought it would be better and stronger if I did this by myself, if I held back and didnt expose you to what was happening in my mind so I wouldnt be childish or immature. I was in a bad state, seeing things in a very distorted way, and avoiding people out of fear they would admonish my thoughts. I isolated which has hurt me so bad: the time feels wasted, I can never get it back.All Ive really wanted in life is to love and be loved. Other people see me differently than how I see myself. Because i felt I was not adequate, i overcompensated. It was embarrassing, confusing and painful.Over the last several weeks, Ive dropped the act a bit. Ive been able to look at people in the eye and smiles come naturally. I see people differently, as wanting to help rather than hurt. I see myself as imperfect but the same as others - lovingly imperfect. Allowing and accepting these qualities makes me more able to do so in others.I remember the talks we had, the moments of sharing our must vulnerable selves, and feeling the utmost relief from being heard, validated and love. It is the only way. I see know that I have more knowledge to make better choices about how to spread love. Only through love, and soft understanding, does the message get across. Only through love will their be another chance at forgiveness and a better life.I hope that my friend understand. I think they will. I hope  that I can continue to try to ward off those critical thoughts toward myself and my parents, and accept them in a way I could not before. That is perhaps my biggest fault and evil, blaming and criticizing them in my head for what felt like being wronged and ignored.I wish I could tell them all of this. They may not really know the extent of the problem, nor understand.Above all, I thank a therapist who listened to me vent and complain, and saw me only through loving eyes. I thank her for pointing out the good in me and for listening in a non judgmental way and for treating me with respect when I could not give it to myself. Our latest session was so healing, I cant explain why or how, but without it I wouldnt feel at this very moment.Thank you for helping me turn to the light side, to lift the veil of fear that has clouded my ability to see what is true and right, to see that there is a better way. Thank you for showing me that without rain, only a Desert can exist. Maybe this rain helps me become a person who has a forest of feeling to share with others in an imperfect hut lovable way. I find it hard to feel harsh toward others when I know many others can be as lost, hurt and confused.God, please grant me the ability to see the light when my mind wants to jump to the worst possible conclusions about myself. Please help me see that Im loved in spite of my faults, and that what I think and what is actually happening can be very different. I hope that I can return to the light over and over again, to the best of my ability, without becoming hurt and in pain as I have been.Thank you. Edit: I also wanted to add that I am grateful for choosing to quit marijuana two weeks ago. It was perhaps a major contributor to the depression, and I see that I wasnt being loyal or true to myself. It affects everyone differently, but it may help or hurt those who are sensitive or have a chemical imbalance. Anyone struggling with drug addiction, know that you have valid reasons to do so. I certainly did, but quitting has cleared my mind to remember that life has good moments, pure moments of love.","1"
"I've always wanted to end it but I can't, knowing my parents just spent a shit ton of money on rehab, and other treatments in the past. It makes me feel like I have no escape.  I feel like I'll have a burden throughout my life in knowing how much they tried to help me. ","1"

I also feel I only have more loneliness to look forward to because I'm moving cross country at the end of next month.I took a PHQ-9 yesterday and scored 16. Whatever stress test I took said that I was ""Over Threshold."" Last night, I cut for the first time since I was 19 and didn't even feel bad about it.

"I have never in my life been diagnosed with depression and have never had any symptoms until last night. Ever since last night (where I also made my first post here) I have been feeling this emptiness inside. Like the only times I have felt any emotion is when I have been happy, while talking to my gf to be (hopefully). Im only 13 and Im afraid to tell my parents! They think that I have some form of anger management issues, so they put me in therapy of sorts. Im thinking about telling them, since my mom is struggling with depression also they will probably understand. I dont know, I have just been feeling so empty inside the last 24 hours. I kinda ignore it at school, because then I wear my mask. Its kinda a way to make people like me, I portray myself as the ideal  person to them. And it works. Usually this is why the people who are the most difficult to read hate me the most. I kinda went of track, but I mostly write these for myself to get it out of my head. Thank you!","1"
"I have been through a lot. No family, my only ex abandoned me and so on. I have been through abuse and I struggle all alone. I was attending a short-term class and I was aiming to make friends and be happy. Ended up as an outcast and mostly because there was some drama between me and the guy I liked. The guy I liked was biased since he was my teacher's relative. Last day he ended up doing something I did not like and felt betrayed, so I ended up snapping after he left. I could not control it. So I had the teacher screaming in my face and defending the guy. Then he acted nice. Still I feel so damaged and I did not stop crying for 2 days. I was such a fool. I was chasing a guy who I thought liked me. There is an upcoming farewell party and I was planning to attend and now I am being told that it requires RSVP and it is too late cause the guy I liked collected email addresses to RSVP but did not mine. I feel so depressed, like an outcast. I put effort in this class to make friends and then I realize those people were just being nice, not caring.And then my teacher acts I am wrong and the class is so loving and I need a therapist because I view everyone as an enemy, etc. Describes me the guy I liked, his relative, as this perfect nice being. And then he contradicts himself saying I am a good person. I have been feeling so bad to the point of considering suicide. Please give me some support.","1"

"I had a major research paper due yesterday that was worth a third of my grade, and there was just no way I could finish it on time.  What I submitted wasn't a reflection of how much research I had done because I didn't have time to cite it all or arrange it into a logically flowing essay.  I couldn't have written anything coherent without first doing heaps of research because none of it was common sense.  I had an A in that course and I'm probably going to finish with a C.  I worked so hard all semester.  The time constraints for the larger assignments in that course were insane.  I spent so much miserable, sleep-deprived time on that course and this final blow is what it amounted to.I'm not privileged enough to not have a job.  My mom is too poor to help me pay for college.  Maybe taking other classes at the same time was a mistake, but I'm not psychic.  I don't understand why the due date couldn't have been next week, when classes actually end.  I feel guilty for resting over Thanksgiving break when I apparently should have kept my nose to the grindstone.  I shouldn't have cooked anything, I should have begged my mom to not invite my obnoxious uncle over, I should have spent every day that the library was open in the library- there was no real break, but I was too naive and burnt out from previous weeks to see that.  I actually did study over the break- just lightly, because I thought that was okay.I feel stupid and irresponsible.  I feel like I'm getting what I deserve.  People will always judge me as adjectives rather than circumstances.  I actually found the course extremely interesting, but I just couldn't keep up in the end.  Experiences like this lower my sense of self-efficacy.  They show me that success in life is largely out of my control.  The subject was central to my identity- it was about globalization and policy.  A C is what I'll have to show for it.  I could have written a stellar paper if I had just one more week, and I think we all deserve one more week because that's when most other finals happen and this assignment was a massive 12-15 page research paper on what we'd recommend to solve very large scale problems with no clear solutions. I wasted hours and hours researching how to reform American K-12 schools only to find that the poverty in some schools was driving down the average test scores of all of them.  The answer I found was preschool- nobody talks about that.  It isn't in the news.  All the talk is about funding and understaffing.  Apparently, the economic inequality in the US is so severe that it screws up poor kids for life, and excellent preschools give them the early stimulation that their parents can't give them.  How they perform in kindergarten compared to their wealthier peers actually predicts how likely they are to not graduate from high school, but nobody talks about that. It makes sense now, but it took me so long just to arrive at that solution.  I only had two weeks, counting Thanksgiving break, plus other classes, plus work, plus my crazy uncle, plus my car breaking down an hour away, and plus having to wake up too early to drive my mom to work because we're all sharing one car now.

"About 2 months ago i broke my knee in half and had to have surgery. While i was in the hospital i met this nurse, who id later fall in love with. I told her everything about me. We did MDMA together. I had been in relationships before but this was different. She was my favorite person, i was willing to put my life on hold to be with her. I wanted to join the military, and live on the coast. To me it wasn't my goal but my dream. I hate the mid-west. For her i decided i wasn't going to do that, instead id move down to bowling green, KY. The last place id ever see myself going or even want to go. But i would do it for her. Maybe we rushed things. But we really clicked that well. At least i thought we did.4 days ago she left her apple watch at my house and i found out she was still texting her ex. I told him immediately what was going on, how she was cheating. He did not know and was probably more hurt than me, they were together for 3.5 years. He had some idea but wasn't sure. Poor guy. I felt terrible. He even got her the apple watch. I was scarred to tell him honestly, i'm a small guy and he could kick my ass. Hell from what i heard about him i figured he would. But he appreciated me telling him. It was the least i could do. More than anything i wish it would have been the other way around. That i was the one been cheating on after 3.5 years instead of 2 months. It hurts me knowing i did that to someone. I cant imagine how bad it feels. If i was in his situation i may have killed myself.These past few days I've been drinking, taking hydrocodone, and etizolam non stop. Time feels like its been moving by differently. Almost faster. Its more bearable. I don't think i am suicidal, but I've been having these thoughts. That if something happens to me from all this i don't really care. The only thing that was stopped me from out right killing myself is my dog. Shes like my kid. I either get cheated on or left in every relationship I've been in. This feels like the final blow. Like this is the standard.She has been trying to text me, it feels like fucking harassment. I would block her and she would text me from a different number. I bet she is reading this considering she has my Reddit username. She keeps trying to justify it. Id like to know why, but i realized its not worth thinking about. The why does not really matter at the end of the day. It's just what it is. ","1"

"I get bad motion sickness. My entire childhood I would focus on faraway objects instead of the road. At 18 I wouldn't know how to give directions to my house even though it's like 5 miles. Didn't understand road signs or how to merge etc, just tried really hard not to puke. No one took the time to teach me, either. Yes, I've tried Dramamine. It's not even just the car that makes me sick, it's the flashing sunlight through the trees. Like a strobe light. Watching tv at night, and certain games do the same thing.The summer before last, I tried pot. Noticed it took the nausea away and I enjoyed car rides quite a bit. I could actually look and see what's going on around me. Got a bottle of CBD oil a few months ago so I wouldn't have to smoke every time I get in the car, works great. Felt inspired to finally learn how to drive. Failed my learners test twice in a row and got discouraged. I want to give it another go, right now, but it's so hard. I lack common sense when it comes to the road, I literally spent my entire life looking at the clouds, and I still can't give or understand directions when people ask me. My parents are just as useless as I am. My father is an actual homeless bum and my mother is a drug addict who gave up custody of me when I was 6. I grew up in multiple households and was never really taught how to do many basic things. I do have a sister, but we don't know each other very well and she already has her hands full with her 7 children. I know how unbelievable this sounds, and I'm not even sharing the other tragedies in my childhood but please just believe me.My husband has been taking care of me since I was 18. We have three children. He has PTSD and is rated 100% disabled by the VA. He gets benefits that put a roof over our heads and pay our major bills. He does not work, because it puts too much pressure on him and it worsens his condition. Which means I have to work, and I'm happy to, but I can't drive. He does not have the patience to teach me. I completely rely on him for everything. I've lost several jobs for lateness, because he is very slow in the morning. I want to say it's not his fault, but he stays up until 2am playing video games and chatting up girls on okcupid. I started a new job recently and love it, but we got into a fight yesterday because we were running late (he wouldn't get out of bed) and he wanted me to eat before going into work. I told him there was no time and I don't want to get fired, but he pulled into a McDonald's drive thru anyway. I had time to eat half a hash brown before he parked in front of my work and he got angry when I gave the rest of the food to him. He doesn't understand how to prioritize some things. I ended up getting a warning from my boss. I have no friends, because he always ends up trying to fuck them (he is a serial cheater). He's even invited two of his female friends to live with us, both without asking me how I felt about it. He doesnt want to go on dates with me, even if it's free. Our sex life is a joke. His idea of foreplay is wiggling his cock in my face or saying, ""Gimme some."" He doesn't give me orgasms and doesn't understand why I'm no longer enthusiastic about getting on my knees for him. He will get angry with me and treat me like shit if I deny him. After I do what he wants, he goes back to his games and talking to girls. He falls asleep on the couch most nights, just passes out wherever he is.I don't talk to anyone or go anywhere. I have zero friends, really. I don't even make eye contact with other men my age. I've fantasized about having a license, leaving him, getting my own place and entering the dating scene. I'm often told by people that I'm pretty, but they don't know how hideous my stretch marks are from having three c-sections. If I were to meet a man, I wouldn't be able to undress in front of him. Yeah yeah guys don't care about stretch marks, sure. But I will still feel inferior to other women, it will feel like I'm a downgrade and I would feel sorry for whoever gets stuck with me. I'm alone but I want to escape. My husband's family has money, if I were to leave, he'd win custody of our children because I wouldn't have a stable place for them to live. I try to look past his faults because I know how worthless I am, and I have faults of my own, but it's getting harder. I just really want to die, I've tried getting help and they put me in the hospital for two days, twisted around everything I said and acted like I was an actual threat to myself, and sent me home with a prescription. My husband got tired of taking me to therapy after the second session.I'm really tired, I love my children but I can't even drive them to a fucking doctors appointment. I love my job, but whenever my coworkers ask me questions about myself or want to chit chat, I have nothing to say. I don't know why I'm even posting here, I doubt I'll follow through with any advice. I don't know what else to say, so I'll just submit this post. Sorry for the jumbled mess, thanks in advance to whoever reads this. Please don't link me to a suicide hotline. I'm not going to kill myself. ","1"

I can't stay committed to an exercise routine for more than a few days. I'm awful at drawing and painting. I can't commit to completing a single programming project. I want to be good at something. There's so many things that interest me and I just wish I could fucking stick to one and get good at it. But I can't. I always give up and I hate myself for it. ","1"
"The fear is hitting me hard that my fiancee is planning to move out of town. With or without me. I told her I don't want to move away from the city we live in, but my opinion doesn't seem to matter and she's still looking for a place. Plus friends are coming to me on her plans, and she doesn't seem to want to talk to me about them.My relationship at best is currently unstable.I'm currently on her Welfare file as a dependant meaning all the money comes in under her name, so I got nothing to pay for to fight for my daughter.It feels like her family hates me if they are putting this idea in her ear as she's out of town with them currently.I don't want to get friends in the middle of this, it's not their fight/problem.

"im 22, i live with my parents. i have a part time job but other than that i really just play video games and spend time with my boyfriend. i woke up this morning and went downstairs and my mom decided to have this big talk with me about how if im unhappy with my life i need to do things to change it and im not working towards any goals. except ! i am ! im not happy with my job and even though im not looking for a new one now theres reason for that! im gonna be a keyholder soon, which looks good on a resume and it also looks bad for me to have 3 jobs all lasting less than a year so im waiting stuff out for my resume to look better. then she told me i need to take a break. but thats not how life works? you cant just take a break from everything? especially when you have a job and even if you could it doesnt matter! because as soon as that breaks over youre going back to the same shit that made you unhappy in the first place! and im just wasting my life away playing video games in my room and talking to people on the internet but i need to find real friends that i can go out and do things with but i dont even LIKE going out and maybe i should go back to school but that sounds like a mental breakdown waiting to happen because its been that way literally every other time ive tried to go back to school and idk im ranting now im just super annoyed with everything right nowTL;DR: dont try to tell people what they need to do with their life when theyre already trying their best to get things done ","1"

"Today was going quite well. I was quite productive till around 4 pm. Now I feel so low and worthless. My friends were seated near me doing a course project and they were talking about going to a bar. It wasnt that they completely ignored me. Every now and then I would jump into the conversation. But theyve now left and they didnt even ask if I wanted to come. Im sure they didnt mean to ignore me, they just thought I was busy. Still it kind of hurts that none of them even asked. I always say yes when people ask me to come with them for dinner or drinks or a movie because its pretty rare. It makes me so happy to know that someone thought of me for a moment. When they dont think of me when Im right in front of them, it sucks. ","1"
"This year has been many things, although I really don't know anything anymore. I feel like I'm going insane, although I feel content. I used to know what my emotions were, what I enjoyed, what I disliked, all of that. Lately it's just been a blur to me. I suppose if it's worth mentioning, I had depression for about a year and a half.. or so, I finally ""fixed"" myself at the beginning of this year by force, although I'm not sure if it worked out for the best. I've gone through a lot, at least I tell myself I have in my mind, and now I feel as if I'm fading. Not going back into depression necessarily, not anything like that, I mean fading as a person. I'm losing my humanity and my will do to... anything. I guess it's kind of what you hear a lot, everything I enjoy is becoming dull to me now, and this has happened before, although it's been lasting a lot longer this time. Video games are still slightly appealing, although I feel like I don't have enough time to do everything I want with them. Music is nice, I love music and all, but that's beginning to fade. All I listen to now anyways is the kind of music that makes you feel nostalgic / melancholy, so I dunno. It helps clear my mind, not worsen my mood. I don't think anything I've written makes sense, I'm sorry for that, I feel like I'm being haunted in my own mind. I've always been a shy person but this year I've really changed that, but at the same time, I've lost absolutely every last bit of desire I ever had to have a ""friendship"" with someone. I'm in a relationship, but friends are not what I want anymore. I just want nothing. I feel like I've realized that friends lie too much, will leave too soon, aren't there for you, all that.. but maybe I'm picking the wrong friends. I seem to be attracted to the wrong kind of people for myself I guess. I really wish I knew what to do with my life, I don't want to end it or anything, I just feel done. Empty, and well.. kind of lonely, but I don't mind that.. I feel as if whenever I speak about this to myself in my mind or my girlfriend, or even others, I just go blank and I honestly don't know what to think of myself anymore. I hate it and I wish I could be okay again, but okay with doing things. Not just okay in an ""I feel empty but I'm content now"" way.","1"

"I broke up with my emotionally abusive boyfriend over the summer which made me start school off on the wrong foot. That on top of a bunch of other things such as feeling excluded by my two best friends have caused me to become depressed and lose all motivation to do anything, including school work, and so for that reason I have decided to medically withdraw from this semester. I confronted my friends but went about it completely wrong and attacked them/blamed them for causing my depression and my medical withdrawal. I have since apologized but now they wont even talk to me which causes me to be even more depressed. Im still at school auditing my classes but having no responsibilities or friends have made it so hard to do anything but lay in bed all day. I have hopes for next semester  but until then I dont know what to do. One of my friends who will no longer speak to me is my roommate so you can imagine how incredibly awkward that is. Im torn between trying to mend me relationship or saying fuck them and moving on considering they significantly contributed to the intensity of my depression and now want nothing to do with me at my lowest point. I just dont know what to do other than sit and be sad, any advice would be so appreciated.","1"

"Not sure how many of can actually relate but here's my situation. Recently the person I've been closest to in my family died, tbh I thought I'd be okay knowing this is apart of life. It's important to mention I've left high school to do online school  (I want grad a little early) but when I left hs, my friends ditched me too. Which wasn't so bad considering I lost much more now, however these feelings of feeling deserted hit when I started reaching out to my closest friend(ive known for 10 years) I could catch in the way he was speaking to me was pitty or that he looks down to me now, when in retrospect, he's had it as tough as me growing up so why can't you understand or take me serious?I get it though, he pulls more girls than me, makes more money than me and carries himself better. That's my brother, I love that kid, but its like he should of all people understand what I'm going through. It's like being a genuine friend or even the women in my life, love is a foreign concept. And that helplessness just hurts, feeling nobody could relate to my hurt. And it's a little hard for me to distinguish if I'm making this shit up or I'm actually being clowned by people I consider family. Also for time frame, this stretches over a month.","1"

I suffered heart problems and malnutrition from being underweight after shedding too many pounds for fourteen months (I weighed 103 llbs (about 46kg)).

"i was born a son to my dad, a local politician, and my mom, currently working in a company's administration department. i had a really odd childhood. i remember being very quiet and calm, but also very angry. my mom used to spoil me a lot, she bought me everything i wanted and always let me win in games we played together. i didn't know what frustration was for the longest time, and was really used to always get what i wanted, and when that wasn't the case i'd get really angry, and i mean really angry, not just a normal child tantrum. i probably learned this from my mom, who gets angry and shouts at everything, even the most insignificant of things, she's been this way since i can remember. my classmates back in kindergarten used to make fun of me and i would get so angry and that would amuse them so they'd bully me more, then i'd go to the teacher so he/she would scold them for bullying me which made them hate me and bully me even more. i hated it. i was extremely serious-minded, and even the slightest joke against me made me scream with anger. my only friend was this kid (who is still my friend today) who at one point started bullying me too in order to get along with the other kids this made me slowly get away from all my classmates and i'd always be alone in break time. i hated breaks because i'd be so bored and it would be embarrassing to be alone, to be the kid with no friends. at age 3 i used a computer for the first time, and it became my world. i had no social life basically, and lived inside my virtual world, barely ever went out of the house. all of this lasted throughout all of primary and middle school. my dad was never really present, as he was with my mom but didn't live with us because of his job, and left my mom when i was 12, after which i never saw him very often again. my problems with anger persisted as the years passed by, and started hating going to school more and more each passing day. anxiety also started being a big problem for me, and still persists to this day. i've always felt like i was the weird kid and constantly desired to be like everyone else, to be accepted by others, to not be bullied and/or ignored by my peers.this is the small bit that i remember from my childhood, because i've forgotten most of it. i really believe that it was really traumatizing. i am 18 now and i've figured out that all these things are what made me develop into a lazy, depressed, angry, empty shell of a human being. later in life i'd find many, many friends who would later abandon me (or so i would think from their actions) which, combined with my dad's abandonment, made me develop a deep fear of being abandoned. the fact that i was so spoiled as a kid and so used to instant, effortless gratification, since i always had good grades and was constantly praised for it plus the internet which was my easy way to entertain myself without having to socialize, has made me unable to make an effort for anything. also my lack of socializing made me into the most introverted kid ever, which is something i have just been able to get over slowly since i was 16 and started going to parties and whatnot. when i was 14, i came to the philosophical realization that life is meaningless and that nothing i do actually matters in any way, which also triggered more depressive symptoms in me as time passed.all of this has also caused me a lot of trouble with substance abuse. i discovered marijuana at 15 and since then became an addict, smoking every single day, even when it started being damaging to me and made me have serious problems with my parents (mostly my mom). i also started going to parties and getting fucked up on alcohol and smoking cigarettes pretty much every weekend. at 17 i got into psychedelics and had near death experiences with certain drugs like 25i-NBOMe due to my irresponsible use of these substances. i've thankfully stopped smoking weed, so far i've been clean for 7 days and going strong (hopefully).i am currently in psychiatric treatment, i take 150mg bupropion and 100mg lamotrigine every day, which was prescribed to me as a way to boost my mood, concentration, and energy, since one of the main symptoms of my depression was the fact that i felt completely demotivated and unwilling to do anything, plus excessively sleepy every single day regardless of how much i slept. i was also in therapy for two years until i decided to stop going to it since it was starting to becoming a nuisance and seemed more and more useless to me as time went by.i don't know what to do. i feel empty, anxious and depressed but most of all i feel completely traumatized. it's like all these uncomfortable and sad memories of my childhood still linger in my subconscious and hurt me, but at the same time i can't remember 99% of them, like they're a ghost that's haunting me constantly but at the same time it becomes invisible so i can't fight against it. i've felt this way since i was 12 (although back then i didn't really know why) and it started getting significantly worse around a year ago. i get angry at the smallest things just like my mom does. i want to feel better, i want to be a normal person. i feel like I have a mental handicap, an illness that i just can't fight against. the mental states i get into have started going out of my own control and make me do the stupidest shit. i've cried myself to sleep countless times by now and ripped entire shirts to shreds because of my anger bursts. help me, please, i'm starting to run out of options. it's only a matter of time before my spontaneous desires to kill myself eventually become a reality.","1"
"I'm about 60k in debt thanks to student loans, medical bills (to pay for depression meds and therapy), credit card debt (shopping addiction thanks to PTSD) and a private student loan that fell into collections (thought it was part of my consolidation package, was dead wrong).

"I have just gotten out of the mental facility here in my city.  I live in Florida. It was a very interesting situation that I did my best to be positive about. Here's how it all started: I woke up feeling very depressed and anxious and told my boss I would not be able to come in. When she began arguing with me, I told her that I was sorry, but I did not want to come to work when I was experiencing bad thoughts (which I guess was a bad thing to say... it could be taken out of context but honestly I just confided in her because she told me I could trust her and she'd always be there to listen if I needed anything, and I just wanted some sympathy.) I told her I was going to go see my therapist and get some help and that is why I wanted a day off. She promptly fired me because she said I was absent too much (I had to take one day off because of a doctor's appointment and one day due to a medical emergency, but I tried to come to work during that day, and she decided to close the office early for the holidays.) I was very upset and begged for my job back, but she told me she was clear on her decision. I applied for some jobs from my laptop and decided to take a nap, only to wake up to three officers at my door. I was very confused and afraid. They informed me my boss had told them I told her I was experiencing suicidal thoughts and was worried I'd hurt myself. This was hard to swallow. I informed them I was fine, and that I did not mean to worry anyone, and I only turned to her because she expressed that she'd always be willing to listen if needed. I felt as though I could trust her, and I feel very stupid for doing so. I was calm when the police came into my home, but they told me they had to take me to the hospital. At this point, I was terrified. I was shaking as they told me to put on clothes and gather my things. Now, I've never been to a facility before, and they had me convinced that I was only going to get checked out for a couple hours. I was hoping that the intake staff there would dismiss me. I have struggled with depression and anxiety, but I have never felt suicidal and I've actually been on an amazing road to recovery since this summer, with no issues at all. So this really floored me. I was put in the facility for three days. I was so upset at first, but as I realized there was nothing I could do about it, I accepted my fate and stayed positive. I was polite to the staff and treated everyone respectfully, followed the rules and participated in some really neat group activities. It really wasn't a terrible experience. I actually really had a lot of fun considering. I was in an inpatient program that was much less intimidating than I expected. My meals were taken care of, as I do not eat meat, I got to take hot showers and I slept like a baby after taking a sleep aid I requested from the nurse. I did cool art therapy sessions and kept busy by reading books. I wasn't happy I was in there, but I was determined to make the best of it. I just want to write this to let everyone know to be careful. I told this boss out of confidentiality that I was struggling, and she betrayed me... I understand I can't just blab about mental illness to anyone, but I figured I'd be okay under the american disability act to receive reasonable accomodation, as I wanted to take that day off to go see my counselor, who I hadn't seen in weeks because of his holiday plans. It upset me that even though I was taking action for what they thought was a problem, I was still taken away.But there is nothing wrong with that. Everyone struggles. This was just another experience for me. But, it held me back so much, as I had finals this week and projects due this week... and my boss was well aware of that... she made things so much more difficult for me. Thankfully, I talked to my professors and they really have pulled together to be flexible and I am permitted to take my exams and turn in my projects next week. I have come a long way through my recovery from depression and anxiety, and while this was a huge setback, I will not let it break me. I was prescribed a small antianxiety pill that I will take as needed and will continue to see my therapist. I was thinking of pursuing the issue legally but not sure if I have time or funds... Just wanted to vent. Thank you.","1"
"I have been depressed since I was ~9, severely depressed since I was 12, I'm 19 now. I genuinely can't remember a time I was happy in a lasting way. I was so severely depressed in high school I never made friends or developed interests. I would just go to school, come home, do my work, go to my job, and sleep. I didn't even play video games, listen to music, or watch TV. I did nothing. I don't have memories from high school. I've started telling people I meet (who I know I'll never meet again) that I was in a coma for a few years and it's basically fucking true.Every single person I know has something they're interested in. Something they're knowledgeable about, something they seek out on their own time. For me, if I have free time, I sleep or play with my rabbits. I also have almost no memory or attention span so even when I try to get into things, or talk about things i'm slightly interested in, like literature and music, I can't remember names or albums or genres and I just come off sounding like a poser. I don't get references to popular movies or TV shows, I didn't have a Smiths phase in high school, I genuinely feel like I can't relate to others.I feel like I'm at least 7 years younger than everyone around me. I didn't socialize at all in high school so I'm extremely awkward and uninteresting and I never know how to respond to what people say. I don't know how to seek out my interests because my college town is tiny and rainy so I never feel like going outside. Right now I'm in school for essentially human trafficking relief and most of my extracurricular life revolves around a project relating to child pornography so no one wants to talk or socialize and I for damn sure don't want to talk about that at parties. Other than that I have no skills, nothing to show for my nineteen pathetic years of existence.Has anyone overcome this?

I am incredibly sociable. I will introduce myself to whoever is relevant and will take every opportunity to build friendships, the problem is that these friendships end in nothing more than me being a ""fun guy to have around with"" I just don't know what else I can do.

Work, my mother who don't give me the space to live, and then there was an abusive boyfriend an a narcissistic friend.I got medication for my depression, the anxiety disorder, the character disorder, they also made the diagnosis of a cognitive disorder.The therapy helped me a lot, nearly a month ago I managed it to move into my own flat, and all was so... easy. So warm, bright. I could do whatever I want to, at work everything was fine....till yesterday.Suddenly I am missing that narcissistic friend, could not help my best friend with her problems, feeling ugly, that I never will live a normal life...The pressure to do self harm grows, I feel like I am useless... that I have no right to live, that there is no task for me. That I will be alone forever, and everything is getting darker and darker per hour.I can't find a therapist here in my town, and I have no car to move to another.I just want to cry, but I can't do that without hurting myself, I hate myself for missing that friend, dealing with the idea to forgive my mother for everything, that my problems with cleaning my flat come back and I'm living in dirt again...Why do I have so much diseases? Why can't I simply love somebody? Why I am afraid when someone is touching me? Or being afraid with a lot of people around me..?I am falling, drowning..","1"

"Im just bouncing around reddit now trying to find something to care about. Everyone seems to have that one thing where theyre like I always wish I couldve done X thing, but never did. I dont even feel like I lack in motivation, I just really dont have anything Id want to do with my time outside of college. And now its not even just with life goals, its hobbies to; Ill just sit on my Xbox home screen and look at the games, not even being able to get myself to play anything, even when I do its just me going through the motions. Ive actually put myself into situations and tried stuff as well but none of it sticks. I hate this and its not helping the suicide thing much when I have no meaning or aim.

"I've been doing ECT for about three months now, and i am starting to feel a bit better. Not perfect, still far from ""normal,"" but better.However, now reality is starting to really set in. I am realizing that, for the past twelve years, my mental issues have completely ruled my life and defined who I was/am. I don't have a very good history with jobs and colleges, and I have completely isolated myself. So I guess my question is: what now? I am 23 and don't have the faintest idea of who I am or what I should be doing. How do I start moving forward? How do I begin picking up the pieces of my life that I have destroyed? I dunno. I guess, if any of you guys have moved on from your mental issues, I would love to know how you did it. I feel better, but I think I'm more lost than ever.","1"

"Idk why I'm posting honestly. I guess I don't have another outlet and simply crying at work isn't a good idea. Might even get me fired. Who knows.I've been feeling this overwhelming darkness and loneliness coming for a few days. Thought it might pass. Of course it fucking didn't. That would've been much too easy and encouraged.I feel like a burden to the grand majority of my friends. Most of them have ducked out of my life due to this depression. It's been a little crazy over the last few months, but didn't expect to lose about 90% of the people in my life because of it.They always say you can count on your friends when the going gets rough. But this has taught me that you can't. They tell you you can out of courtesy. But please don't burden them with your garbage and insecurities and paranoid and anxiety. Anything but that.I've even started to doubt if my own family wants to deal with me. The family who's usually there for me. I can see it in their eyes; they don't want to listen to this. What happened to the cheery guy that used to make us laugh?Well he died. And the recent abandonment isn't going to bring him back.It feels like a darkness, large and overwhelming and all-enveloping, is blanketing over me. It subjugate whatever it touches. Turns it all to ash. Nothing exists but this darkness. If only a light could come clear it up..But those are gone. Good luck now..","1"

"I cry everyday. There is almost no day I don't think about suicide. It's going to be a year in this situation. In some way I know I won't kill myself ever, but to deal with these thoughts every day it's exhausting. I want to go to a therapist, but I'm not sure how much time I'm staying in this city. I started visiting one in my former city and then I had to move to this place before ending my therapy. I have shared my problems with a few friends, but they are not being very helpful. I can only call them once a week or so, and the truth is nobody wants to hear about depression. I have noticed some of them turn down the conversation when I start complaining or telling about my problems. I would like to trust on my family, but my parents are very anxious and they already had to deal with my sister's anorexia 3 years ago. So I feel guilty to not be ok and to cause them a new problem. I'm already 30 years old after all. I know I need more help than reddit, but the truth is it's here where I find some support.","1"
"I'm not here to get anyone's pity or to feel sorry for me. I've just come to the realization that I'm not ment to be with anyone. I've been curious about the same gender for a little bit, so with a help of a friend I've been going to a gay bar for a while. Though I never get a positive response. The guys I interact with never return my texts. I saw both of them tonight with othet guys. I get it, there's no law that says that they have to be attractive to me. But the fact that they falsely lead me and hurts me. They made me feel special being noticed, which is a big deal for me. But why do that if they were truly not interested? Why give me their number if they never planned to reply? Why give me that? I hate getting excited when I see a text only to be let down when it's not from them. Perhaps I don't handle rejection well, but that's just me. I can't help it.The only girl who I believed ever truly understood me doesn't feel the same why. I would rather not have a friendship with her than to chase something I know I will never have. It sucks because no other girl or guy compares to her.But oh well I guess. I wish I knew this sooner.

"Formatting may be shit, this is my first real post on Reddit, and I'm not bothering to test the formatting rigorously before posting. Fuck it.So, I have a thing (.txt file) wherein I write opinions and such if they come to me at a convenient time -- which has been three times, as it turns out. I though I would post the three entries I've written, since maybe people will read it and subsequently tell me if I'm being a dumbass or not. There's some vulgar language, and some very roundabout sentences with very little point, but I've tried to keep everything in because otherwise I would be lying, and what's the point in that?I appologize if I sound pretentious, snowflake-y, or otherwise. On with the show.Thoughts on romance, feelings, the future, and self-worthI, in general, don't feel very happy; can I say I'm depressed? Probably not, no. I wouldn't want to, either, since I feel it would be a disgrace to those who have been properly diagnosed. All I've done is take the occasional online test when I feel at my worst.Depressed people typically talk about an empty feeling, or something similar to that. I don't think I've ever felt that; similarly, those with depression talk about being dull to emotions, which I don't think applies to me in the sense that I've always been kind of adverse to feeling.I find that my emotions go up and down, in an almost sine-wave form. This would be something more like bipolar disorder, but then that typically requires that the periods of time where I feel manic/depressed are relatively long, or that I feel manic at all. I can go from feeling perfectly okay, to feeling like I want to fucking die in approximately 15 seconds, and it might stay that way for hours but never longer than that. So it's not bipolar disorder.Depression gets ruled out again, as those who are depressed typically report always feeling like shit -- and I don't.I feel perfectly fine _most_ of the time, such as at school or with friends -- very rarely do I feel properly shit in these situations -- while as soon as I am put in a situation where I am alone, the bad feelings return. This typically results in very long nights of just staring at the ceiling wanting to die because I feel pointless. Other descriptors are available -- hopeless, useless, etc.Of course, it could just be hormones doing their thing.I look at /r/depression sometimes -- to see whether there's anyone who feels the way I do. Some complain about not having a girlfriend (inb4 mfw no gf), some complain that their lives are shit nonetheless. Those who complain about not having a girlfriend typically complain about being rejected by the one they like, or in general just unreciprocated love. I am in a relatively strange situation, I suppose, as I complain about not having a girlfriend but I also do not like anyone. I've never had an actual crush, nor love interest. There was a point when I thought I had a crush, but honestly I think I just went along with what I was supposed to do at my age.Now, of course there are plenty of girls I know that I would -- for lack of a better term -- like to fuck. Sexual attraction is not so much a problem, but I've never felt romantic love for someone, nor do I think anyone has felt romantic attraction towards me. These facts hurt me more than I feel they should, seeing as I put up a front of complete uncaring. I suppose that isn't so strange -- there are, in fact, very few things I care about -- but I thinkpeople like to judge me as an uncaring person, and then leave it at that; I don't exactly make it any easier for them to not do that, though. It's not like I have any form of social interaction.When I think of the future, I have great difficulty seeing myself in any other situation than complete loneliness.I mean, after I finish the (Generic School Program^TM), I doubt I'll be seeing most of my current friends ever again.On top of that, I don't think I can get new ones, so I see myself at 30, sitting in an empty, dark room contemplating suicide for 8 hours/day.Exactly how things will change I don't know, and honestly, I don't think they will. I think, however, that it would be a waste of life to just end it here, when I've only just turned 17 about a month and a half ago, and I should wait until there is some certainty that things aren't going to work out.I guess in reality, all I'm looking for is some meaning stemming from others. Since nothing has any inherent meaning, to assign meaning to actions you require the help of others. As such, whenever I make or do something, I would want feedback on it; some determination of its worth to tell me if I've wasted my time or not. To tell me if I'm making some kind of useful contribution to this world, no matter how small.Simple, right?Further thoughts on the possibility of a relationship -- or lack of oneWhat I've learnt by reading things on the internet is that if you speculate that you will never have a romantic partner, people will always respond by saying that you will eventually meet someone who likes you. I wonder if this is really true -- I mean, sure, statistically this is probably true for the overall population, but I'm not exactly part of the general population. I don't mean that in a ""oh, I'm special"" kind of way, but rather in a bad way.I mean, I'm fat, at most average looking, weak and I have relatively uncommon hobbies (mathematics, primarily). This means that finding someone who will be quite happy to hear me ramble on about some complex analysis bullshit is rather unlikely. Most people don't want to sit and talk about mathematics for hours on end (of course, the discussion on why people dislike mathematics so much is far too long to fit in this little entry), and I am quite annoyed by people who fake interest or joy. It just makes me feel bad -- I'm both boring the person, and I'm learning that my efforts to talk were completely pointless. This means I can sometimes be somewhat demanding regarding the reasoning for liking something I've done, as I simply don't trust that you do.A second reason I will likely not find a romantic partner is of course that you need to meet people for that to happen; I'm incredibly anti-social, as you may know. On top of that, a third reason is that if I somehow do find someone, maintaining a relationship isn't exactly trivial. I'm not sure I am even capable of it. First of all, you need to interact with the person on a regular interval -- which would be a problem for me. Second of all, sincerelationships are a two way street, it is quite easy to be emotionally dependent on the person and that can be quite mentally draining I would imagine, which decreases the chance of the relationship staying a relationship.I feel stupid for even existing.Thoughts on social paranoia(?) and friendshipsPerhaps social paranoia isn't the right term. Perhaps it's just pessimism, cynisism, or any other such -ism. Point is that I tend to feel sort of paranoid about people's opinion of me. In an unhealthy way, that is.I've found that I'm fully incapable of trusting what people tell me. When people tell me things, I tend to mentally tell myself that the person is just going along with the flow of the conversation to get it over with. For example, if I ask someone if I'm an overall good person, and the person says ""yes"", I will not believe them. I just won't be able to, because it feels more likely to me that they would be saying the easiest thing just to get the conversation over with as quickly as possible. So I feel paranoid and kind of shit because of this. The concept reminds me a bitof a Kafka trap. The more you assure me of what your point is, the less I believe you. A particularly annoying part about this is that it contributes to my need for acknowledgement by my peers, and as such is part of the reason I might repeatedly ask the same question to one person, which can be quite annoying I would imagine. Then the problem is that I can't really ask something -- going back to the previous example -- like""are you sure you're not just saying that to end the conversation topic as fast as possible?"" because the person would likely -- and rightfully -- assume that I'm making undue assumptions about them.A consequence of this paranoid behavior is, for example, that while I believe myself to have close friends, I assumethat I am no one's close friend.An example of this behavior happening just today is that my friend, who I will refer to as A, asked -- on the behalf of ""a group of 10-12 people"" -- whether I liked a girl whom I occasionally talk to at school -- one who most people, as I found out, find annoying. Now, the answer was of course ""no"". As mentioned in at least one previous entry, I've never felt any romantic emotions -- which is a source of great stress for me. After I replied, a couple of things were on my mind: Why do I not find this girl particularly annoying while most others find her extremely annoying? Is there anything wrong with my perception of people? Why did people assume I liked this girl because I talk to her, when I practically talk to everyone? Since A replied ""Alrite"", does that mean he believes me, or does it mean he's just saying that to end the somewhat uncomfortable topic?As you can see, I demonstrated this pessimistic, paranoid behavior in a situation where it really shouldn't be that difficult to determine the truth. I mean, A is one of my closest friends, so logically he shouldn't lie to me. However, once again this leads back to my behavior: while he is one of my closest friends, I have no evidence that he even enjoys my company. He might just be lying to me to avoid hurting my feelings unduly, since -- from my perspective -- we've been friends for quite the while.One of the worst things about this is that my brain tells me that perhaps everyone experiences this on a regular basis, and I'm the only one complaining and having my life be affected by it, which makes me feel like a massive piece of shit.On a semi-related note: I have no idea why anyone is friends with me. I'm a fuckin' asshole and I complain about things. I'm probably at least annoying.So, why are people friends with me? My brain says they're not, and that they're just lying to me in a rather well planned attempt at fuckin' with me.I feel fuckin' trapped. At least I still have a sense of humour.","1"

"I dont know why Im writing this, Ive never wrote about my feelings or anything like that. Maybe I want to get my feelings in writing to help myself understand.I have friends I think. I hang out with people at my university, and when I go back home I spend time with my friends from high school. Yet most my life I havent felt like people have truly wanted me in their life. People still invite me to events and such, but this feeling stems from the little things.Its hard for me to explain the little things that make me feel unwanted. These little things are instances that in themselves are insignificant. Yet over time, such as when I reflect on the events of an entire week, it becomes clear that I am the lowest on the totem poll. Think of it like this, if 4 friends and myself were walking on a sidewalk that could only fit 3 people, I would be the odd man out. Its trivial situations like these that happen every day that really wear me down. At the same time, I see why Im the odd man out, I just cant seem to do anything about it. I say stupid things sometimes. Words that have no ill intent, yet the meaning is often lost. Id say the meaning is lost partly due to me just being dumb sometimes and partly due to my friends simply having a disposition to inperpret what I say in a certain way. Something in particular that hurts is the relationship between a close friend from high school that goes to my university, my roommate, and myself. I introduced my high school friend to my roommate, and now we all hangout because we relate on many things. As the semester has progressed, both my roommate and my friend have bonded well. But what hurts is that they clearly prefer each other over me. Once again, this shows in the little interactions we share, and I feel like a third wheel every day. They most certiantly arent in the wrong for preferring each other over me. Im angry at myself here. I wish I had someone that wanted to be with me, regardless of who else was around.Ive struggled with feeling like this since middle school, and Ive pushed through because I always told myself things would get better. They said high school would change things. Then they said college would change things. Well now Im in college and nothing has really changed. I cant think of a day thats gone by in which I dont think about ending my life. Moreover, the thoughts have been getting worse. Theyve gone from wondering what the world would be like without me, to thinking about how I specifically would go about doing it. Ive wanted to be with those around me, but it feels like those around me dont want to be with me. I want to be wanted.Maybe no one will read this, but I guess it feels good to get it out.","1"

"Today I walked in the middle of the road down the yellow divider and I felt a rush for the first time in weeks. The excitement of being on the brink of death is the only good part about life. But a cop stopped me and talked to me. I was super embarrassed. I hate talking about my feelings to strangers but I always seem to put myself in situations that require it. Another time was when I had an absolute mental breakdown when I came back to my dorm room. I was screaming, crying, throwing a fit behind thin walls. Ofc the neighbors called the cops on me and I almost got away with saying it wasnt me, but the bitch across the hall ratted me out. Just like my ex says, Im batshit crazy. Guess its time to wear that insult as armor too huh. ","1"
"I tried starting a conversation and people actually wanted to talk to me about stuff. I am feeling pretty good right now.","1"
"So... I've been around the block with my mental health. Figured a lot of stuff out, been in many different places with it over the last few months. Been kinda running at breakneck speeds around the block the last few weeks.My loved one left me. I admitted to them that i had failed again in trying to stop my pornography problem. It was a huge issue for them, and I knew this. I could either defend myself or condemn myself for that whole thing, but in the end it doesn't really matter. It's a behavioral addiction that was a huge struggle to try and stop, especially with the feelings of being shamed for it. But if I wanted to stop BADLY enough, I would have been able to.But regardless, I had managed to decide finally that I was completely done with it, and I was in a very... idk how to explain it. A mindset that was very open and honest with myself, and I really saw that admitting the truth was the right thing to do, or I would contantly feel like I was hiding a secret, even if I did put it entirely behind me. They didn't leave me right away. We said we could work through it, go to therapy, rebuild the lost trust.   A month and a halfish later they told me they wanted to break up. Didn't really have a good open conversation about it, but oh well maybe we can someday, maybe I'll get that closure someday of honest dialogue.But now I'm just cycling, going through everything from collected and optimistic to hopelessness and anger, everything in-between. Past couple of days, I've cycled back to a place of missing them very, very much. I'm still loving them a lot right now, and it really hurts.  I was off of the porn for that period we were still together, and another couple weeks after the break up too. This week I'm back on it though.I'm having trouble finding ways to fight it. Like, I'm not able to argue against 'hey you're just taking care of yourself' or 'what's wrong with giving yourself this pleasure' those kinds of thoughts and feelings. I keep believing I can 'handle it' or stuff like that.I got like, semi-instant karma for it last night. I fucked up somehow and downloaded some movies on my mobile data instead of wifi. 5 gigs at 10 bucks a gig: just completely threw away 50 bucks. Not counting the other 3 or so gigs from watching in the bathroom at work. Its like c'mon, why don't I feel that strongly as obvious signs that this is a bad idea? A poor excuse of a coping mechanism, continuing to feed into my lack of self-confidence and motivation. It's like I do see it, but only half the time. For a few hours until I'm horny again.Like I said, I've been going through cycles, so I've been focusing on other stuff too. Planning for the future, thinking about things I want to do, getting the ball rolling on getting some new healthy habits and stuff. So hopefully I will realize that falling back on this is standing in the way of the changes I want for myself. It's just so hard to go 'OK that's it,  relapse over'.... when there's just so much good fucking porn to watch, you know? Like it sounds stupid but that's the honest feelings. The long term looking out for myself thinking versus the instsant gratification drive. Neither truly needs to be an enemy, I just need balance. And there are other ways to treat yourself in the short-term. It's almost entirely a question of habit. I just have to find that will again. For myself, and no other.","1"

Also, pretending to care and be happy for other people is hard and in my head it's just blowing up so that makes it hard to actually care for other people. I just have to make people think I'm content when really I'm still trying to figure out if it's worth it in life. It's so hard, I can't even go out anymore. I can't look in mirrors, I can't take pictures, I can't stand to look at any body part for more than a few seconds. It's even hard typing this because I get to see my fingers.

"Hello, long time lurker first time poster. I've personally struggled with depression my entire life and am - I think - fingers crossed - starting to work myself out of a dark hole I've been in the past 4 months. I don't want to jinx things, but life seems to be looking up for a change.The whole time I've had the support of my wonderful boyfriend. We're currently long distance  (different countries) and just a few hours ago he opened up to me about how down he's been feeling. It sounds exactly what I was and still kind of am going through.It shattered my heart. I don't want him to feel this way. If I could take it off him and put it on myself I would. I hurt for him. I've never had a significant other struggle with the same thing. I don't know what to do. I want to help but I have no idea how other than listening and talking to him about it. I have no advice. He feels stuck in his current situation and cant do anything about it for another 2 months. If we weren't long distance then I could at least help out with physical things like cleaning up that I know are hard when you're suffering.He feels like everything is gray and boring/no motivation/things are pointless.TL;DR: Any advice on how to help my long distance boyfriend with his depression? It's hard to offer concrete advice when I have similar struggles. How can I help him other than just quietly listening and watching him in pain?","1"

"Sorry, just wanna get a couple of things off my chest. Things have been really rough for a couple of years now and I have no friends or therapists I can approach.I was an unplanned/bastard, mixed child in a closed-minded society so I've been alienated by both family/peers all of my life. Never really had any friends, gave up on doing them years ago. Some years ago a grandma I didn't really know that well got a really aggressive, terminal type of cancer and I was the only one willing to take care of her as she was dying. She had been ostracized by our family since I could remember, but it turned out she might've actually been the sanest, most loving one of us all. She ended up dying in 4 months instead of the suggested 6, so a big chunk of my family blamed me for not ""saving her"". They haven't talked to me ever since.My nana, whom I loved unconditionally and whose death had been my biggest fear since I was born, started dying a few months later. On her deathbed she confessed she hated me, and thought my half brother had had a miserable life simply because I existed. Something definitely broke inside of me then.Later on, things appeared to get better. I got a scholarship and an acceptance letter for college in another country. I was happy to start anew. Now that I'm here I'm having quite a hard time. The institution is corrupt and teachers grade assignments based on affinity with the student. Not good at all considering I've gotten into shit with most of them. I work from 7am-10pm, and commute for 2 hours daily, weekends included. I'm getting seriously sick but still can't get any passing grades simply because I'm not getting friendly with the teachers. I've always been a honor roll student and an obnoxious tryhard so I'm quite convinced it's just the way things work here.Now my dad is going blind and, again, none of my siblings wants to help. I'm just considering dropping out, going back home and helping. He abandoned me when I was pretty small (got back in touch later on) so I'm just... wary. In general I just don't know what to do with my life. Is it really worth continuing?Sorry for the lengthy rant.","1"

Then I dig a grave in the ground but I leave a small opening and a big hole.

In a year ill be studying abroad, all alone in a foreign country. Im afraid its going to kill me. Last time my life changed like that i fell into depression. It was when i switched schools a year ago. Going to college abroad is going to be so much harder. Since i got out of depression ive tried to grow as a person. Cant say i havent made progress but im still very insecure, emotionally unstable and have no life goals. I know i will struggle to make friends in college, mostly because i feel inferior to everyone around me and have no idea how to make meaningful connections. Also i dont have an instagram (obviously because im very insecure about every aspect of my personality), so everyone thinks im a freak. My friends are not coming with me. I have no idea what im gonna do in an entirely new environment with no one to support me. I really dont want for the suicidal thoughts to come back. sorry for ranting, im just really sad. ","1"
"I've come to realize I'm so desperate to fit in that whenever anything goes wrong in the friend group I'm in, I self destruct.

I push everyone away from me, and then when I realize it I can't fix it so I self medicate away my days with alcohol and cocaine and hope that the pain will go away and that I can be numb. It doesn't work. It never works.I was on my way to something amazing and I ruined it and caused so much hurt and I've tried to fix it but it's too late.

"I apologize for the long ass post but I need to put all of this somewhere. And i have no where else to turn.I am going through a break/break up. Im still not 100 percent where we stand bc she has issues with confrontation( she lies a lot not just to me but everyone in her life) And now has basically refused to talk about feelings or anything about us anymore. She says she needs distance and space from me. But i believe she is cheating. We had an issue at the very beginning of our relationship plus like i said she lies a lot until you show her proof. She had the location history set up on her phone and i looked through it and she was not where she said she was. Then when I show her proof she gets mad bc i am snooping. Its been a never ending cycle for the last 3 years. The ""talk"" happened a month ago and she moved out about a week and a half ago. We hung out twice since she moved out since we are suppose to be trying to make an effort and having ""dates"". Since she told me that she wanted to take a break I have been depressed. I mean i was depressed before but now it has become extreme. I have stopped working the last two weeks and turned in a notice to take a leave of absence for the next month. I physically am unable to go. I drive there and have a panic attack and leave. So i figured i should just stop going instead of having to deal with trying to leave everyday. I didnt like my job before but now it is completely unbareable. I also run a small online business that has completely suffered due to my inability to want to do anything. I am losing out on money during the busiest time of the year. Which makes the depression worse. Besides when i have been out with my ex? I have not left the house or eaten. I have been smoking two packs of cigs a day and drinking some water but thats about it. My stomach hurts all the time. I use to smoke pot up until this break. But now when i have tried it makes the anxiety worse so I have basically completely stopped. I feel completely alone as I have no friends.  A few ppl that i talk to about my online business but nobody who I share any sort of personal details. I let people drift out of my life the last few years bc of my depression and feel if i tried to contact them i would be an asshole who only wants something and is a burden.My mom passed away about 2 years ago and really thats when the depression started. I never sought out much help besides from my SO. I put a lot of my emotional baggage on to her and that's probably when ou relationship really took a turn for the worst bc I became a different person. My Dad has always been emotionally distant so I can not talk to him bc when i have tried recently he turns the conversation to himself. I have 2 younger sisters that are significantly younger than me. I have talked to them bc they know something is wrong but i can not continue to dump on them. Three weeks ago I went to the Dr and got an SSRI and a benzo. The SSRI makes me feel worse so I have stopped taking it. The benzo provides some minor relief so I take it about once a day sometimes more. I have never taken any kind of medication as I have never been a fan of going to the Dr.Well this past weekend is when i discovered the most recent lying and had a break down. I could not keep it together. So i slept as much as possible and cried when I was awake. I decided to call a therapist Monday bc of my actions over the weekend and have my first appointment Saturday. Its a pretty big step for me even just making the call.Today I finally got my ex to talk a little after having no communication for the past few days and she said I am pushing her away due to my snooping and doesn't know what she considers us now. So my reaction to this is now to delete all of my social media. I took everything off my phone. I feel like shit tho and just want to reach out to her but i know she doesnt want that. I dont know what to do with myself. I hate being alone and just want her here. I hate my life but really dont want to do much to fix it. I cant barely get out of bed despite knowing I should. Part of me wishes I would just die to end this pain. I feel hopeless and alone. I am a mess. I am embarrassed. Everyone things my ex is the greatest and I think about what people will say when I tell them we are no longer together. I hate myself for still wanting her bc i know she has treated me poorly but i still love her.If you have read this far i appreciate you. Your a better person than me or anyone that i have in my life at moment. I hope this pain will subside and I can begin to slightly function again. But until then me, netflix and my bed is where I will continue to stay.","1"

So I crashed at her place to take a bus the next morning. There, we continued our talks and found out we have basically the same music taste, so we listened to all our favorite songs 'till 4:00 AM. Now, one night later and alone in bed I just realized that my majority of days is spent like this. Being alone, doing nothing and reminiscing the past... It sucks.","1"

"Earlier today I have this Academic Coaching session for my college, its was mandatory, my coach and I were planning out my goals in general like what are my short term goals...etc. Then we got to this question:  where do you see yourself in 10 years? I told her I dont know and she said so are you gonna die then? I laughed because I know she was joking but I honestly dont see myself in 10 years...I cant say yeah Im going to die in 10 years time...it will be a really awkward moment for both of us.

"My CBT therapist suggested that I deal with rumination by distracting myself, eg by listening to music or watching comedy programmes. It seems to work, but it isn't a fix.

"Hi, i'm 20years old, in this post i'm not asking for empathy or anything like that to be honest i'm just here because i need to express myself i guess.For me i'm sick since i'm 7years old (so for 13years, or 65% of my life), that means i only lived with this depression because before 7years old you don't really know that you don't even realize that you are part of the humanity...Anyway i think i'm sick since i'm 7yo because i remember understanding that the world is actually pretty ugly (for exemple the war, the crimes like rape etc...) and i actually remember that i tried to kill myself like puting a knife in my mouth and trying to force it in my skull (one day my father caught me but said nothing and even told me to not play with knifes) or even drowning myself in my bath. My parents got ""divorced at the age of 11, at the end of primary school, it didn't affected me or i don't remember affecting me. But i understood that i was really in a depression like at my 12-13years old when i was crying in my bed for some nights in a row because i thought that i was ugly, the world was disgusting and others ""stupid"" reasons. All this years i was scarifing myself on my left arms, no one noticed of course cause i was hding it with my clothes. It started escalated very quickly at the start of high school, this year i left Paris for Nice (south of France), where my only friend was kinda bullying me ... When i could i choose to come back to my mom house at paris and came to my primary/middle schoolOn the second year of high school i came back and told my best friend ""I'm coming back this holiday i want to meet everyone !"", by everyone i meant my closest friends and he litteraly told me ""You know, everyone hates you"", so i didn't go to paris this year and like ignored this but in fact it litteraly destroyed my mind, i cried a lot because of this, the fact that my best friend that i had since i was something like 4 told me kinda destroyed me. After this i trusted even less people and never got really close to them.On my last year of high school i got really depressed, people in my class clearly saw it when i got a bad mark at my first big test of physics and where i litteraly cried and scarified myself in class but no one told anything, even the teacher said nothing to my parents. For the first time of my life i remember expressing my sadness to my father like 2 months after the beginning of this year. He took the problem very seriously and sent me to a psychologist. This year i made a new ""best friend"" i was hanging with him all the time and teach me how to party etc... but we never talked about anything real like my depression 'cause i didn't wanted him to get involved in that. Even after i had a new ""best friend"" and was class was accepting me i was still sad. I, even between 2 meetings with my psychologist, scarified myself so hard that i bled a lot (still got a big scar), my father was completly lost but refused to go to the hospital (i don't know why) and took care of everything. At the end of the year, like i always done, i faked the fact that i was happy and my father thought that i was ""normal again"" and let me go to Paris (Orsay) to learn in the university Maths/Physics/Info.This first year at the university was actually pretty cool, i was at a residence where i make a lot of friends and even i integrated the association and i was co-responsible (i don't know if that is the word) of the internet. So the first semester was pretty rough but nothing unsual, i scarified myself but hide everything, i was at the 4th floor even thinking some days to jump and was hanging in front of the void like 1 times every weeks. But at the 2nd semester everything happened, one week i was so depressed that every night i started hanging at the edge of my windows, praying for someone to see me and call for help, the 3rd days i called the emergency number but they didn't respond and i was scared so i left the call, called several times but nothing. One day i called my father litteraly crying and with my arms in blood he called the firefighter and the police who came to my door and stopped me. At the hospital they asked a lot of questions, i don't really remember what, but they asked ""do you want to go to an specialized hospital"" and i said yes. The next day they sent me to this place, this was a place specialized in depression and with someting like 5 schizophrenic people (i knew one and he was actually really cool). It was actually pretty strange they gave me a lot of meds but i wasn't happy and the day they tried to move me to the ""new division"" to one of the ""older division"", when i was at the table with a lot more of people and they were like spying me and i had the feeling they were asking in their heads ""omg a kid of this age shouldn't be here"", ""he looks crazy"" etc... i overreacted, took a knife quietly and lock me in the bathroom and scarified myself, of course after half an hour locked they saw that i was missing and found me inside with a lot of blood on my arms. After 1 months they let me back in the residence and every months i had appointments at a specialized building called a ""CMP"" (Center medical and psychologic).So my years was kinda ruined but i decided with the meds and the helps i was ready to start a fresh new year and a new start without my depression and to be honest for the like 6 months i was just at my residence without having to go to the university i was ""happy"" of course i was depressed but less and i could live, no more suicidal ideas or not a lot.The first semester i tried to take lessons because i validated my semester so i couldn't repeat what i already learned but the university refused. The thing is when i started my second semester i saw that i havent work for something like 10 months so it was like super hard to work and i just ate me really fast. Even with stronger meds and stronger meds my depression came back really fast and i tried to suicide again. Of course when i saw that i couldn't contain it anymore i asked for help but nothing and the schema repeat like last year, a very rough week where i kept calling the emergency line and one day i called my sister and she called the police and firefighters. But this time i called them and asked before accepting the hospitalization and they clearly refused because for them the meds and the hospitalization were clearly useless and were not helping. So i came back with them a lived for 1 months with them before returning to my residence where my job was to find new studies.I left the residence this year in august, i stopped meds because i felt like they were doing nothing on me, i started taking studies of psychology in Nice but again the schema repeat 1 months ago, where i started not going to the university getting really depressed etc...To be honest i have no more hopes, i lived my whole life with this ""depression"" (i hear voices and have hallucination but the doctors said : it's a atypical depression), i'm convinced by one thing i want to die, i'm living a nightmare and i want to end it. I talked to my father about this and he said ""the only way to keep you alive is to hospitalized you because i don't want to lose you and i can't keep an eye on you every second"". I will see a psychiatrist in the incoming days my father will see if i need to be hospitalized. All my life i have done bad things and fucked up a lot of relationship with friends/girls and even my sexuality is strange .... because of a lot of reasons i can't even have a proper relationship with someone (i mean love relationship). Of course i didn't go in details of everything.I want to thank you for reading everything even if you don't comment and have a nice day.","1"

"I'm 34. I'm married to a beautiful, smart, talented successful woman who loves me and has a great family. I have three kids who adore me. I went to one of the top schools in the country and graduated with honors in academics and was a champion athlete even through my late 20s in endurance sports. I was a top performer and accomplished military officer, serving around the globe including in an elite unit in Iraq. I left that, founded a company on technology that I built and raised millions of dollars from supportive investors. I have been on TV, have celebrity advisors, been in numerous magazines and newspapers, sit on the academic board at a prestigious engineering university and asked to speak around the world on AI and technology.That said, I have no close friends cause they are all super busy leaders with no time to sit and listen to my whining.Everyday I think about killing myself pretty much all day. How I'm going to do it planning it, getting money ready for the family etc. All I want to do is sleep or surf the web. I see no reason to do any of it. I've tried every hobby and none of them are exciting or keep me interested. The only thing I feel like I enjoy is picking up women, but I can't do that anymore cause I'm married with a family. Even when I was doing that it was just temporary too and not satisfying, just one woman after another.I've been to therapists my whole life, and none of them have any answers. I came from a fucked up childhood, but not the worst I've seen from my peers. I don't have PTSD, but have anxiety and never been formally diagnosed with depression because I'm so good at masking it.I'm really at the end of my rope but when I see others posting, I think I'm super lucky and need to just suck it up. Everyone I talk to says the same crap, exercise go outside etc... But that doesn't help it just gives me an hour or two of distraction.How can I get help? Nobody wants to help cause I look like I'm doing fine and I can't explain why I feel like shit cause I have no good reason to.","1"
"I did it I finally did it I figured out how to perfectly be and how to perfectly fit. The answer of course is when everyone thought I was okay.

The second is everyone liked me so much more when I was who they wanted me to be. My job will like me more who knows maybe it'll be easier to find friends anyone to like me really. Third is go back to repressing and cutting like my mom has told me if you look happy you'll be happy and if something bad happened a sentence spinning around in my head.... bleed it out, just bleed it out and it'll be okay. It'll work. It has to.","1"
"I guess I'm going to start writing now. I am at the base of a tower in which I plan to fall from in a few moments. I don't know what my purpose of writing this is. Maybe I think that writing this will serve to bring me happiness. Maybe I want to try to explain myself before I remove myself from this world. I am most likely ,however, writing for pity. I can tell myself that because I am not going to experience the desperate attempts to save my worthless life that I do not in fact want pity. I can tell myself that I truly just want to stop hurting people and that this is the best way. I can tell myself that I am a martyr for an unknown cause. That I'm a hero for sacrificing myself for other people's sake. But when it honestly comes down to it I don't know. I don't know if I can repair my wrong doings but I do know that I feel like I can't. I don't know if I am truly at fault for everything that I think I've done wrong but I know I feel like a failure. For all my success and accomplishments there are failures. And everyone goes through failure and that is a part of life. But my most recent failure has drained the last bit of hope out of me. I will tell myself that my next action will somehow prevent further failures and make people happy but i know that won't be true. I know that if I remove myself it will be my final selfish act. My final failure. Many things matter to me and I know that your failures don't define you. But I define myself by my most recent failure. All I wanted was to bring joy and happiness into people but at that I failed. I cannot make people happy and I feel destined to ruin the lives of others. I wish this was well written in the hopes that it could matter to someone but I don't have the time or the skill to make this decent. I have but a few minutes until my battery dies so this will just be my final thoughts which are scrambled and chaotic but anyways back to my previous point. I cannot make people happy I hope I have done so before but in the end I hurt more than I do good. The perfect example is what I plan to do next. This will hurt people. They will probably feel guilty even though everyone I know has been nothing but good to me. I cannot expect more from such amazing people as I continue to be such trash. But I have never known anything not what will be good or bad. I've always committed to a decision as that's the only way I know how to get through life. So I have committed to this. Once I start that climb I will have one way down and it will be destructive. I had a much better writing planned but it's too chaotic to remember or understand what is going on. I wish I could've been a better person. I wish that I didn't hurt people the way i have. I wish I could be the heroic good person I tell myself I want to be. I wish I cared enough to be good and commit to doing right. I wish that at times like these where I know I am being selfish and pitiful and worthless that I had the guts to stop myself. I wish that i could prove to the people I care about that I truly do appreciate everything they have done and that I am sorry for being who I am. I hate myself and what I do and have done. But I am broken.I can't feel anymore. I can't cryI can't loveI can't know anythingI wish I could tell everyone what is going on. I wish I could explain to everyone what my life is and what my decisions have been to lead up to this. I want to go out of this world being known as a hero or at least a good person but that isn't going to happen that isn't who I am. I am trash. I am worthless and selfish and I will now commit my final awful act. My final failure to hopefully end all others. I suppose I'll share this with someone but I don't know if I will be strong enough for this climb so I should leave now. I want to talk more. And I want to enjoy life but I guess this is it.","1"

"Hello.I will try to be as precise and exact as I can be.F18Diagnosed with vegetative dystoniaMost possibly, my mental issues are genetically inheritedI feel not understood even if I just try to start a conversation. And I start with the smallest things, just to see if the person is on the same page, kind of. Guess what? I never finishI have a lot of pressure on me from my dad. He has some kind of a medical degree, has depression himself and has taught me that anti-depressants work, but you will never in your life will experience genuine, pure happiness anymore. So I'm scared. I'm scared to even open up to him about how bad it really is. I'm scared of judgement. Of him trying to press charges on my mom (because she doesn't try to help me) to get the child custody on my sister(parents are divorced, I am not considered a child anymore). Of him pressing me into healing naturally. Of him being not understanding.ALSO - he has actually told me the ""people have it worse, some are disabled, some are blind, be happy about what you have"" bsMy mom is openly calling me lazy, spineless and weak-willed. She doesn't believe in mental illnesses. She legitimately thinks that I'm faking it and I'm just lazy. Basically, she doesn't care about me. When I'm sick, most she'll do - open a window. That's all.I have no one to talk about this and feel understood afterwards.Have been to psychotherapist twice and I know that I had to go through a course(?) and it doesn't help immediately... but I still absolutelt hated it.My immune system is basically non-existent at this moment. I catch every virus I can, I get pinched nerves in my back every month or so. And that leads us to =>Because of being ill a lot, I miss out on a lot of things in school(last year rn). So I have a lot of things to do, many deadlines are coming up... But I have 0 motivation. I am fully aware of the consequences(dropping out), but I still have no energy fot that.

Never ending cycle!Because of finishing HS this year, I have to find an university etc. There's a long story about my search, but, long story short - I failed, my parents aren't doing any help but just reminding me and it stresses me out.IN CONCLUSIONI am stressing out about my stress. Too scared to seek help, scared of my mother saying ""stop acting as an idiot and just go and do (..) without thinking"" and not understanding me. Scared of my dad trying to tell me that ""you don't have it that bad."" Scared of being seen as weak and an attention seeker. Scared of being misunderstood. Scared of opening up. I cry myself to sleep, feeling things I cannot described. Being dragged, ripped up in two pieces by two different forces... idk. Feeling empty. Helpless. As a burden.Thanks for reading if you got this far... I feel a bit easier. P.S.: English isn't my native language, feel free to correct me.","1"
"I have battled depression on and off my whole life. This particular episode started in the summer of 2016. I've had ups and downs, feeling hopeful and then getting sucked right back into it.I take medication, I go to weekly therapy. I've tried setting up morning and evening rituals to help me feel productive. I've tried weekly exercise. I've reached out to hotlines numerous times. I've shared my thoughts with family and close friends. I feel as if I'm doing everything I possibly can to get better, but I feel like it's not worth fighting anymore. There are weeks when I feel like I've made some great progress and that things will get better. But for every week like that, I have a week like the one I'm currently having. I have intense feelings of hopelessness and despair. I slept like a cat today, I got almost 20 hours of sleep because I just want the days to go back to feeling okay. I used to think of self harm to cope with the thoughts of suicide but I don't see the point anymore. I jump straight to planning how to commit suicide. I desperately want it to get better, I don't want to commit suicide but days like this one just take everything from me. Edit: I am on my period and the week of my period my depression always skyrocket. It feels like all the depression I haven't felt throughout the month complies onto this one week. I know that it will feel a little better in a weeks time but it doesn't make riding out the storm any easier.","1"

"Seems I was just pulling out of last years ( I seriously need to refresh my memory on where the damn apostrophe goes lol) depression.  I totally miss enjoying Christmas.  The day after Thanksgiving I would drag out all my decorations and the kids would help me do up the house.  The day after Christmas I would go to Target or Walmart and buy more decorations that were 50-75% off for the following year.  It would take me 2 days to get the house decorated, and it looked awesome.  Id put on Christmas music and wed have hot chocolate... I still did it when my daughter went college, not far away, but was too busy to do it some years. Then my husband decided we were moving to SoCal and with no kids down there and him pretending to be Jewish I just lost interest. I missed my kids,  grown now, but would only put a tree up on the years they would come down. The other years I just cried.  Being down there kicked my ass in the depression area. I drank a lot and used to ask God all the time to just please take me. Instead He brought me back home to NorCal. But I remember looking forward to the holidays.

"I understand this is more fitting for r/suicidewatch but from what Ive seen of that sub its a surprisingly cold place for somewhere where support is expected.I dont really know what Im posting this for but I guess I want to hear some people sympathize or something.I remember thinking a lot more logically than I wouldve expected, and for once I finally knew exactly where my belt was funnily enough. I walked into my restroom where the shower door has this sturdy metal rack thing I thought would be perfect. I managed to find instructions on the first page of results which I think is kind of ridiculous. I was surprised to find that cutting off blood flow to the carotid artery was a lot more efficient and painless than restricting oxygen flow. I tied a simple knot with the top of the belt and looped it through in such a way that when pressure was applied from the inside of the loop, it would tighten. My psychologist parents used to tell me all the time how smart they knew I was, and I was finally putting it to use. But apparently slight reserved ness is psychosis in the eyes of my mother, someone with a PhD in psychology. Gaslighting through and through. These were the things I thought about as I quietly stood with my head in the loop. I finally decided release my weight and fall but in the two hours I was standing there the knot had loosened, causing the belt to slip of the rack when I let loose.I cursed about it but lacked the motivation to actually re tie it.Jesus Christ in these past few days I feel like Ive been losing it.

"The entire story is a TL'DR even for me, so i'll just point out the main issues. Which may also be a little bit long.1. Unhappy since i was 10yrs old, when i finally moved to a elementary school(10-15yrs old) that over the years introduced me to the concepts of popularity, sex, bullying, figting/drinking/dating= makes your existance more valid. Im including my highschool years as well. 2. Growing up in my older brothers shadow(he's charming, ambitious, every1 loves him). And im the exact opposite. We are best friends, yet i hate and love him at the same time. We rarely spend time with eachother anymore. He lives in a foreign country for 5 years now.3. Never had a gf. I met a girl during my last year in HS(not the american kind of one, which means i was 19 yrs old). And she was the most amazing and beautiful person ive ever met and the only one i ever cared about/loved. Obviously i couldnt be her friend anymore, she had a bf, so i told her that i couldnt see her again due to those reasons. It left a huge scarr on my heart and it hasnt healed 1 bit for 3 years. No matter what life goals i work with. Always end up thinking about her. Nowadays she has a wonderful bf and a baby. Happy for her, but obv she don't care for me anymore which is understandable.4. Stabbed in the back by my so called friends on my 22nd birthday which made me stop looking for any kind of friendship. This was 1 year after i cut ties with the girl as stated above. I happily talked to her and invited her to my party and she gladly accepted it. Too much details but it ended up backfiring after my ex-friends ditched me which made me feel so fking upset that i just ignored everything. And we continued not talking to eachother EVER again.I have 3 best friends atm. And i rarely see them due to us living in different parts. No problems for me since we talk on the phone from time to time.5. Realizing that nothing matters, we are basically monkeys looking for attention and validation. Life is not as magical as i expected it to be. Emotions, anger, love. Nothing but chemicals in our brains. My entire life might be a simulation etc.I have goals. I have a nice apartment. Semi-well paying job, very physical tho. Car etc etc.I work out regularly, powerlifting and just recently picked up swimming. My so called depression-relapses happends from time to time and makes me wanna starve for 3-14 days which hinders my progress and sets me back drastically.My problems: I hate working, i hate people(including myself), i hate life(not only cuz of my own unhappiness, but also cuz of all the cruel fates life hands out to other living beings.)Nothing drives me to make me wanna work towards my goals. I dont really fken care for social acceptance anymore, friends, gfs is just a waste of my time.Yet, I just want to be alone in the darkness and sleep.Not looking for magical solutions or ""positive"" thinking- talk. I dont mind them either. Just wanted to write stuff down.Thanks for reading.","1"

I go through my days largely alone, even though from an objective standpoint people might assume that I'm doing fairly well in life.I'm attractive, in shape, intelligent. I do well in school (on track to graduate magna cum laude in a B.S major), I have a job that pays well, has great benefits, and allows me  to travel all over the world. I don't do drugs. I've only recently started drinking  a lot- but it's literally only to cope with terrible feelings of hopelessness and isolation. I just genuinely don't believe that life is worth living without having friends and people to share life with. I have everything else, but I have no one, and I want to kill myself because living in limbo is worse than hell. Does anyone ever feel that way? Is anyone else's depression largely caused by a lack of social relationships?","1"

"I can't accept love and kindness from people. Even from close friends and family members, I always feel like I'm resisting it. It's like I don't feel like it's real or genuine. Like they are just being nice or faking it. Even when it comes to my mom, who is the most genuine caring person I know, I don't feel like I can fully embrace her kindness. It's like I'm scared to accept her love, or to feel it. I always feel like I'm resisting when I hug her and when she shows she cares I'm super hesistant to let it in. I can feel myself tense up when anyone is about to say something kind to me or say that they care about me. Its wierd because if I look close enough I see that the motivation for a lot of the things I do is because I want people to like me and admire me. I want favorable attention. When it comes to a lot of things I have a big fear of ending up alone,  all by myself. But I'm not alone right now, I have good friends and family, yet I can't fully let them in. I can't take advantage of the social interaction they provide, and so I'm left longing for love and admiration. I'm always longing for recognition of certain good things I do and personality traits I have but when someone points it out or gives me a compliment I immediately tense up or I don't feel like it's really true; I just can't accept it. I think I'm like this because I always felt like my dad was fake. Anytime he showed affection it always felt unformatable or fake. The rest of my siblings feel this way too. Anyways, I ended up always feeling super anxious and tense around him and could never accept any love, affection, or compliments he showed, even to this day. Anyone else feel this way sometimes? Any advice or information would be helpful, thanks. ","1"
"My first ever real psych visit. I'm really hoping to find even the tiniest bit of relief. Wish me luck.Edit: just got home, I learned a lot about my self, man what a roller coaster, turned into 2 hours, some good self help info and therapy set up. Meds I just picked up for anxiety PTSD and depression should start working in a week or 2. Just getting it off my chest helped a little bit, even though it brought back some nasty childhood shit, it felt nice to just let it out in confidence.IF I CAN DO IT YOU CAN TOO. Go get help, even if the meds don't work, the tiniest sigh of relief at the end is a nice little boost that lasts a few hours.","1"
"For the first time in my life I spent Thanksgiving alone. It was hard for me to deal with but last night I realised I will probably be alone for many mmre holidays to come. With all the other things going on in my life recently it was almost enough to push me to the edge.

I had done it prior and they told me I could do it again if I did all of my work. I had been lying to my mom telling her I was doing good. Well now I'm trying to log in and I see that my account is disabled. I'm going to assume that tomorrow a phone call comes and I have to go back to school.

"I struggle with anxiety and recently I've been beginning to feel worthless, hopeless and sad constantly. Sounds like depression to me. I don't know if I've felt happy since my dad died 10 years ago. My interest in things I love has depleted over the years and I'm feeling unmotivated and gross. Lately, I've been having trouble leaving the house. I just don't want to go anywhere, specifically to work. And it's affected my job performance, which is a sales job so that means I'm not meeting my goal this month and will be on probation in December which significantly decreases my income. I'm undiagnosed, but I'm seeing a therapist on Monday, and I'm scared that they'll tell me I'm faking it or inflating the issue. I'm afraid I'm doing this subconsciously to save my job. Or to find pity. Or I'm just the normal amount of stressed due to family and financial issues and I'm a huge wuss. ","1"

The next day brother was looking for cough drops at least that the excuse they used. And he looked in the box where I keep all of my SH tools in.  He then proceeded to go though my notebooks where he found some letters that were address to my family after I was dead but had never intended for anyone to read. I didnt even want them to read them even if I had killed myself. He freaked out and showed them to my sister, who showed my dad. They then decided to search my entire room they went though every box and they took all the cloths out of my closet. They took everything out of my desk. Read though all of my notebooks. This happen last Wednesday and they didnt tell me until Sunday. I saw my parents 3 Times between the time they found the notebooks and SH stuff. They said the his hospital told them to go though all of my stuff and they also told them not to tell me. I am really devastated that they read something so personal that I never wanted them to read. Now I dont know what to do. All Ive done since I found out is cry. I feel worse now then when I went into the hospital. Thanks for reading. I dont have anyone to talk to about this.

"What if all the depressed people today are just the misunderstood weirdos of the past? I mean the writers, the artists, the inventors and the innovators of the past. I don't think anyone here is a worthless little shit that can't think. I think we think too much, which ends up getting us in a shitload of trouble. I don't think it's bad though. It's just that in this age of conformity where everything is public, everybody knows everything it's so damn difficult to be weird. There's so much pressure to just be like everyone. So much pressure to do something, because everyone normal's doing it. So much pressure to like something, because everyone normal likes it. So much pressure to always feel ok, happy and smily and shit, because everyone normal does it. The closest thing you get to being weird and different is just normal people pretending to be unique and interesting. That's not really the essence of it though. The essence is that even if you look or seem normal, deep down you know that you never found anywhere that you actually felt like you belonged. Sometimes you feel like you never will...maybe the point is that some of us really won't find it. Some people just have to find the energy to make their own thing even if they have to carve it out of dried shit. Things won't get better unless you find a way to make them get better.Not saying we all have some magical purpose or maybe we do, but you never know if you haven't found it yet. Searching for a purpose can sometimes be a pretty good substitute for actually having one. It's ok to be alone. Personally I'd rather be alone or be friends with the weirdos.","1"

I recently passed my post grad, my family and friends are ecstatic that I passed my exams as it was a challenging course, however this is a constant repetition of emotions for me, ive noticed no matter how much I excel in any aspect of my life, I feel nothing, I feel God should take me away cause I feel like nothing is worth living for. I know I sound ungrateful, I have family,friends, im an extrovert, I don't have much difficulty with finding dates/friends as im not shy, I have a bright future ahead but somehow im empty, I've went through depression mostly through my academic years which was difficult but I feel no matter what I cant shake it off. I dont know why its been this way, I just thought maybe id get some suggestions/opinions here.

"And when I say amaze, I mean it as it amazes me on how shitty it can get. Each year for the past 6 years have been utter hell. Talked about a lot, various health problems that I still have to this day, lost friends, depression, anxiety, family issues, house issues, lost fights and have been the talk of the town, loneliness, girlfriendless, guilt, self hatred, terrible luck, constantly wanting to die and using bad ways to escape, and now Im not graduating my senior year. I've always gotten the short end of the stick and majority of the people ik knows this. They tend to find my suffering humurous but dont know how ass it truly is. There's things Ive brought upon myself (adds to the self hatred part) and a lot of things have happened to me due to my terrible luck. I've been a lost soul for a while now and now I truly have no clue where to go in life. My state of mind has been completely fucked this entire year.  I've wanted to die for so long but I've never had the courage to end it. I've tried to eliminate my emotions time and time again just to fail miserably. This system is so fucked up that its ridiculous and no one wants to actually change it. I have no clue where to turn to at all. I've tried to go to school and try to do shit but I hate reality with a passion and just want to live in my dreams for the rest of my life. I also feel incredibly uncomfortable at school which is another reason why Im not there much. I truly don't know why I was born when all my life has been is failures, shitty situations, and brief moments of happiness with bullshit waiting for me. I truly hate myself with a passion. I hate the way I look, think, feel, and act. Im not even a bad guy. I try my hardest to respect people and they see it. Most people think Im chill and fw me. My parents definitely dont get it and they think that I enjoy not going to school lmao. They know Im depressed too and they don't even care. Theyre just focused on how Im not going to school. I truly despise my father and have for the longest. He's been so shitty all of my life. Constantly punishing me for miniscule things, hitting me for miniscule things, saying petty ass shit, buying food for himself when there wasnt much to eat, hypocritical, only wanting to spend time with my brother etc and then expects me to respect/bond with him? LOL, yeah ok.My mom always sides with him and thinks that Im ""rebelling"". The only thing I'd be rebelling is this shitty ass system that we're all fuckin stuck in. Of course Im seen as the oddball cuz Im not tryin to live this shitty ass life where I work a 9-5 and slave away for a rich fuck that doesn't give two shits about me and pays me dirt. I don't wanna live in a system with terrible foods and brainwashing entertainment. I don't wanna go to school where it's literally all lies and useless info to fill up space in my head and train me to be a fuckin slave like majority of the people in this country. I don't even know what to do with my life now. Its nothing but misery and failed expectations. I wrote a lot over the summer and wanted to drop some songs but I couldn't because there was no studio for me to go to. Had a friend that said he would let me record but ended up flaking. I have no motivation for anything and now the only places I see myself in are on the streets homeless, in jail, or dead. Why are people dealt such a shit hand in life? There's so many people out here that can't see the light. Why did God allow the world to get so fucked and then expect people to somehow believe in him. Ik he exists others may not but it just baffles me. Like why all of this? Why? Why? Why? I don't even know what Im saying at this point cuz Im just rambling/ranting here. This has been the worst year of my life. I thought it couldnt get any worse than 2016 but it did. Im extremely sorry for the long post but Im also extremely tired of the bullshit. ","1"

I'm always worried if someone overhears the call and goes overboard, sending me to every therapist in the area.

Does ANYONE else have this opinion? I have a feeling that so many other people need help as well, but are too scared to reach out for it.Edit: a few people in the comments gave numbers and names to organizations that actually do have a text line for suicidal prevention. I guess what's really needed is awareness. The fact that a lot of people are unaware of that option is a problem imo.","1"

I can't pinpoint why anymore, but some days I just feel mentally terrible. It's inexplicable. I'm where I wanted to be and I don't regret it, but I'm either really happy or fucking depressed. This compounds itself with not being able to find someone where feelings are mutual. Previously, this was just demoralizing, but now it's begun to add to my depression the more time goes by.

"Hey everyone, first time post ever after doing a bit of lurking. I just needed to get this off my chest because its hard to talk about and its been here for a long, long time.Im not really sure what my major malfunction is, but I often seem to go through routine bouts of suicidal thoughts and feelings or existential dread every so often. Much of the time they come out of nowhere, but my overall consensus is that my life isnt worth living.  Ive felt it since I was a kid, well into my teen years, and now as an adult not much has really changed. My first serious contemplation was when I was 15, I placed my fathers pistol to my head and pulled the trigger being indifferent to whether it was loaded or not and also being indifferent to whether I lived or died. Skip forward a few years later and I enlist. I flunk out of the job I selected for myself and get placed in another job without any choice. Turns out it was super shitty and offered almost nothing of value upon leaving, which Im out now after just 4 years of complete fucking bullshit that I cant even fathom having survived in the first place. It left me with serious doubts in my abilities and self-confidence shattered to a point where the pieces are only glued together temporarily and all that exists is just a facade for others. I feel like I cant do anything right.I have a loving fianc now, weve been together for four years and hes sometimes felt suicidally depressed as well but he seems to be doing far better than me. I sometimes feel like pushing him away so that I have no one and I can just shoot myself. I have distanced myself from almost all my previous friends because I think theyre all mostly idiotic and immature, so I dont really want any new friends because I feel as though my fianc and family are good enough most the time. And speaking of my family, every time I try and reach out to my parents they give me the same bullshit about how life is always a struggle and that Ill be fine and that Im loved. It is just so unreal to me that everywhere I fucking turn no one takes me seriously, not for anything and not even my family.Im working some stupid security job right now where Ive been subjected to even more bullshit and some of the most unprofessional conduct Ive ever seen. But since the Army fucked me its all Im worth til I get my bullshit degree from the religious university I go to. All I feel is seething anger and hate and disdain for everyone and everything but it doesnt show on the surface, and the only thing I can think of is taking it out on myself because its the only thing Im good at. Ive never thought about physically harming others, just myself. Maybe Im just being dramatic or selfish, but I honestly feel so much pain, every day, but I choose to keep going without doing physical harm or using substances. I just play video games or practice the only hobby thats stuck with me for all these years, which is art, but even then I feel like abandoning my art because the escape to a new world in my games where I have anything I want or need whenever I want it. I dont know why I hate myself. Im not a bad looking dude, Im in pretty great shape, I have the few friends I want, I have a loving fianc, my family is always there (albeit with terrible fucking advice), I have a job, a home, a car, a bit of money, and a place to go if I lose it all. But Im just prepared to die, hoping that i dont wake up in the morning almost every day, but also not motivated at this second to just end it. There it is: the opportunity no one has ever afforded me to explain myself. I needed to vent and Im just looking for some advice or maybe someone to talk to about this, but I cant just keep bottling this up and I often feel I dont know what I want or need.","1"

"I've come to realize that my depression has become a fundamental part of my self-image, so much so that I can't imagine what it would be like to not be depressed. There have been times when I have felt something close to what I imagine most people feel like all the time, but this only occurs when I've been drinking. If I'm not sad, I just feel nothing. And isn't that just another kind of sadness?Lately people have been telling me to just ""Get over it"" or to figure my shit out. This has to be the laziest way of giving advice to people. People like to phrase it like, ""deal with your problem"" but it's complete nonsense. Think about it, the words don't refer to anything specific; there's no actions or process that it highlights that will fix anything, it's just a demand that you go from one state: unhappiness, to another ""fixed"" state of being. If being depressed is part of my being, and I'm supposed to ""fix"" that, what else can I do? Sadly, I come to suicidal thoughts thinking about this problem. The only way to fix me is to eliminate myself. Maybe that's extreme, but frankly, no one has provided a better answer to what it means to fix myself. What kind of things do you think of when you think of ""dealing with"" things, or ""Getting over"" something? Is it just like, forgetting? I don't know. ","1"
"I won't go too deep in to this, but small backstory: I have gone through a lot, just as many people. I have PTSD, OCD, Anxiety, and Depression.. My depression is bad. I don't have suicidal thoughts, but I live in my safety bubble. I eat the same things, I do the same things, DAILY, and I DONT get outside that way of life. It's my comfort zone. I've done this ever since I got my first full time job and was broken up with by my ex, who was my most serious relationship. I am numb, emotionless, and empty..I can't click with a single guy. Recently, this awesome man has come in to my life. He knows I don't have feelings for him, and he accepts that it wont happen any time soon because of how I am. but he is determined to stay in my life and not give up on me, because he want's to see me healed and truly happy. He is amazing. I want things to work out. But it's like that part of me that falls in love is just broken. Does this happen often with depression and anhedonia? I have my first therapist appointment for the middle of December. I hope getting help will help me.. I know this is going to be a long road ahead.. I'm not sure I'm willing to take it yet. But here goes nothing..","1"
"To be honest I don't remember much but details will be more available as I get closer to the present. The earliest thing I remember from sophomore year of high school was breaking up with my girlfriend at that time. I havent talked to her since then and looking back that was the stupidest decision for us to be dating. We rarely talked even when we were in person and it felt awkward. Oh well, Im moving forward now.Next up we have basketball season. This has been my favorite sport for so long, and that year I had been cut from the team. Lets be real here, I sucked. I have nothing against the coaches we have though, they are amazing guys that I still look up to. They told me I either had to be a better post player, or get a lot better at handling the ball. Getting cut still hurt though, and I wasnt sure if I wanted to keep playing.The rest of the year up until the spring was just a blur, but the spring was definitely the best part of the school year. Tennis was starting and it was only my second year playing, but I was so much better and it showed because I made it to districts. God, I love this team so much. Its all amazing people and I couldnt possibly ask for anyone else to play with.  School ended, I was feeling pretty good about life.Now its summer break and Im taking Math 95 to get into Math 111 for the next school year. It was a good class, good people, and good teacher. I still learned more than I had from Algebra 2 during the school year. Then I met this girl. Well I say met, but we had already met at a math competition the previous year. We started talking this summer though, and we clicked instantly. I thought she was the most amazing person ever (and I still do). I confessed that I was starting to catch feelings for her and she had said she was as well. That was absolutely amazing to me and when she said she didnt want to actually date until she knew me better, I figured that was perfectly okay. Then suddenly when school starts, shes distant. I didnt think much of it until suddenly she has a boyfriend and big surprise, hes not me. That hurt like hell. I felt like I was slapped in the face and stabbed in the heart at the same time. Two months later now, and Im still hurt. WE DIDNT EVEN FUCKING DATE.  We still talk and shes said she wants me to be happy but I cant see myself as happy without her as more than my friend. She said she knows the girl for me is out there and looking for me. The worst part is I know shes right. I know God has put someone on this earth for me and me for her. This all said and shes still the only person I can think about, and shes been in my dreams. Its all so confusing because I was praying to meet that person soon and I started talking to her. Now I pray and nothing happens. What if she is the one God put on this earth for me? If thats the case then why did she and her boyfriend start dating instead of me and her? I know its highly because Im only in high school, but what if? I dont know. All I can say lately if people ask me how I am is that Im tired. Im not lying to them I am, but they all assume Im tired from waking up early. Im not. Im tired from all the crap I have to see in life, and of being broken.EDIT: There's some stuff that happened recently that I can't bring myself to talk about, but it seems like her and her friends are leaving me behind now.","1"

I've tried to be that person because you're dear to me and deserve that in a friend.You let me use you and go to you and I want you to use me too for whatever I'm worth as your friend.The long talks and the tears and the frustrated companionship I've loved all of it.

"My last session might be my last. I didn't make any new appointments while I was there and told her that I'd call to schedule another appointment. I don't know what I expected. It's okay. It's difficult for me to articulate what I feel in person. I feel like there's so much miscommunication. It feels like every time I visited her I was just sort of rambling along. I was supposed to see a different person but county stuff moves at the speed of bureaucracy. She apologized because it's taken so long for me to meet with some case manager person; I told her it's not her fault although I don't know for sure if it is. At any rate, I think that's it.

"Does it really matter? All of this.  I wake up everyday clamped to my bed by the intense ruminations of my disturbed mind.   2 hours later, I manage to drag myself out of bed, take my ""Truman show"" pills, take a shower, put on deodorant, lotion, maybe one or two sprays of cologne, get dressed, leave my apartment, then get in my car, Commuting to a cubicle for 8-9 hours then come home, watch my DVRs...no wait...I don't feel like watching TV...or doing anything....so I navigate through the internet with the purpose of killing the last few hours of the day.  Bedtime arrives, I lay in bed, #rumiNATION clocks back in, so I pop a ""STFU"" pill then arrive a the world that's completely different than that of my waking existence.  Not a damn thing make sense in this world, but that's ok.   I feel like I belong here...this so called ""dreamworld"".   Then my alarm clock goes off.   I'm back. Here.  In bed.  I don't remember what my dream was about, but all I know is I'd rather be there than where I am now.  I want to look forward to the days ahead, I want to be optimistic, ""happy"", grateful, but how can that be accomplished when everything around you and all that's about you thinks your a mistake.  That's not my reality, but that's how I feel.  That same feeling pushes people away, to where I am alone with my thoughts, my fears, my dread.   I started this off this week thinking I wouldn't make it out of 2017 alive.  The more I try to myself out of this ...""void"" its like the opposing force doubles down, then triples down.

The only thing I'm living for at this point is the few people who deeply care about me, because I know they'd be devastated if I was gone. I can't remember being ""happy"", not that I believe anyone exists in a state of constant happiness, but the last few months have been especially difficult. I graduated high school a couple of years ago and have been bouncing between jobs since trying to save enough money to get a place of my own and get established. My last job was hell, and I quit because I was genuinely feeling like I was losing my mind between working 40 hours a week and coming home everyday to the responsibilities of my chaotic home situation (which I don't want to go into detail about). I started to really feel like I couldn't bear to be awake for another moment for the first time in my life, and as a result I started to drink much more heavily, etc... Now a few months have gone by and I'm in a position again where I need to get a job to be able to support myself, and I'm absolutely dreading the idea of going back to spending 40+ hours a week doing something I hate just so I don't go homeless and hungry. I don't want to do anything ever again. I have a handful of close friends that I'm incredibly grateful to have, but for the most part I exist in almost total isolation. I apologize if I'm rambling, this is one of my first posts and I'm a little intoxicated, but I just can't imagine waking up everyday for the rest of my life, and I'm getting more and more frightened by the thought.

"I have had low grade depression since high school but tried to ignore it/ thought i just had social anxiety. It has since progressed and no matter what i do or change has taken over my life. My relationships are all surface level, except for a few, my family and best friend. I cannot concentrate on my schoolwork very well at all, i just want to lie down or go away somewhere in my head. I just cant enjoy anything I do. I feel so stuck. I know I should have told my mom sooner that I have this thing thats taken me over. The reason why i havent told my mom is because i have ALWAYS said that Im fine no matter what when she asks me. Ive been lying for years. And i dont want my family to worry at all. But its really getting bad. I dont have thoughts of wanting to die, i just want to quit everything i start. I want to just give up on my dreams and on making friends. I have started antidepressants, which i know my mom said to never ever take. I dont know if she will try to say no Im not depressed and invalidate my feelings because Ive always acted normal around her. Thats the last thing i need. And i do have moments of normality. But Im not happy with my life. I dont know how to tell anyone but my psychiatrist that i have depression. I just dont want the stigma, pity and worry. How can I tell my mom/family?Edit: Im away at college and family is at home.","1"
"This kind of comes from a lot of things. My country is going to vote on something unpopular soon that would hurt poorer people.

"My SO does not understand, in the slightest, how depression (and anxiety) can effect someone. Especially the long term effects when left untreated. I've had depression and anxiety since I was about 13, so it's been 9 years, but it has gotten significantly worse the past 2 years during my current relationship.I try to get him to read about it but he refuses to, claiming he knows enough about depression and anxiety already. And he tells me that I cause all of our problems because I don't want to change. I have angry outburts and I try to explain the effects that depression has on me, emotionally, and he doesn't want to hear it. Apparently I can just change that about myself.The worst is that I have suicidal thoughts that become overwhelming at times. Most of the time I can cope but there are times when nothing consoles me and I cannot think of anything else besides hurting/killing myself. I've tried to go to him for help during these times and he tells me that I can get over it myself if I try.It hurts so much to hear that from the person I love. He's supposed to be my support but he makes me feel worse sometimes. There are days I want to break up with him because of this but other days, when I'm happy, our relationship is wonderful and I can't imagine being without him. Because despite the hurtful things he says out of ignorance, he has actually helped me with a few of my symptoms and thanks to him I have a normal sleeping schedule and I take much better care of my self.So I guess I'm here to ask you all how you deal with loved ones who simply don't and won't understand? How do you cope with the pain that comes with their denial of your illness and/or its severity?","1"
"Hi there, I'm 17 years old studying psychology and working a shitty job I just quit, last month. However this was all fun to me before, since three weeks nothing feels good anymore, I am numb, everything is a chore. Literally. It feels like I got 2000 lbs of weight and I want to sleep all day. It all started four weeks ago when I decided to quit smoking weed. Before I found weed I used to be depressed, always thinking about how shitty this world is, how shitty my future will be. Working my whole life away, I don't want people, society, expecting shit from me.. weed was a great anti depressant I guess. I was the happiest guy on the planet these years, now every single moment of happiness feels like faking it. I am going to smoke sunday when I hit the one month off target and I might get some improvements then, get better even I don't know if it's related, if this will stay.. I'm thinking of ending it like 6 times a day when I get alone, but I could never do that because of my familiy and friends. Do you guys think this is related to the weed, should I get back to smoking or sit this out with the risk of falling further and further into this shithole??? I really don't know what to do or where to go.. haven't showered in two weeks, tired all the time, people starting to distance themselves.. maaaaan why did I ever even get born, I can't remember asking for this, going to school, having to work, having to put up with all this bullshit, do any of you guys?Hope someone reads this and understands.

Im a young women, have all to be happy, I just moved with my boyfriend, I have school during the day and then I come home and everything should be ok, I feel like Im so fucking selfish to think, even just a bit, Im depressed... But all my life Ive felt like Im watching an other persons life, like its not me, I feel so dead inside... sometimes I can laugh out loud and the minute after Ill be almost crying for no reason... I dont like thinking its a depression because I tell myself how can you be so selfish to think YOU have a depression? You dont even know what is it, a lot of people all around the world have a worst life and going through very hard stuff. But what I feel inside is... so dark... Im like a jar of water always almost full, and every water drop (?) can makes me cry like hell, like I could die of crying, feeling my heart and my head are shaking and completely broken...I told I have a boyfriend, its true, but he says that Im overreacting really too much, so I try to contain myself and it just gets worse and worse... when he sees me crying he ignores me, like if he doesnt look me in the eyes it doenst exist... As far as I remember, every day of my life Im asking myself and what if I die today? I could die when I drive my car, when I cross the street (sometimes I almost dont look when crossing because I dont matter about dying... but it scares me to do it, Im probably to weak..)Thank you if someone read this, thank you so much.

"I was born with an Imperforate Anus, which mean i don't have an anus when i was born. My parent sold their house to try to fix me. After 6 years on and off the hospital, i finally got a surgery to fix that but it come with its own problem, i can't really control my bowel. I grow up with that situation where i don't know when i'm going to take a dump. It may sound silly, but shitting your pants at a teenager and have them laughing at you is not a comfortable at the slightest. I tried my best at school but i never really excel, whenever i fail something people would told me that my family spent everything on me and i turn out like this, that i'm a burden to everyone. My closet friend move away when i was 12 and was left alone without any friends for a long time. That was when i started feeling depressed. I live with that depression my whole life, but i did a very good job hiding it, no one know i have it, because i always laughing and joking in class and at work. However, when the night come and i was alone with my thought, i always think of myself at a failure and i deserve to die, but i keep pushing on. I finally have a close group of friends, those that i can called my brothers, and thing was good, for a while.I had to move to the US with my family 3 years ago, leaving all my friends and my grandfather behind. In the US, i was alone, having no friend, my family scatter around, barely speaking the language and have to survive by myself, then the depression come back. There are many days that i want to end everything, but somehow i can still keep going. Everyday was as dark as the other, until the day i talked to her. She was my classmate in High school back in my country, we barely talk to each other on facebook, i used to like her back then but she already in a relationship so i didn't start anything then. One day i chatting her up on facebook, she told me about her divorce, how her husband treated her badly. I was there to talk to her, to share everything with her, and before i know it i fell in love with her, and she fell for me. We started a relationship, and those were the best days of my life. We can talk about everything, can joke about everything, we are just like best friend that love each other, everything was perfect. I waited for 6 months before i can comeback to my country to visit her and my friends. That 1 months with them i could never forget.After i got back to the US, i worked my ass off so i can build an actual future with her, and started to talk less because of my schedule. She told my that she was pregnant with my baby a month after i got back to the US, i was overjoy when heard that news. But bad thing keep happening to me, she had a miscarriage and lost our baby. We cried, a lot. Every night i dreamed of a kid who keep following me, i asked them who are they, and they told me ""Why can't i live with you and mom, why can't we be together?"". I cried my eyes out every single night. I tried to work harder so thing like that would never happen again, I thought that by doing it i can marry her and we can live together forever, but she thought that i was avoid her and no longer love her, but never tell me how she felt. There was that 1 extremely bad week when i was pressured by my school, my family, and my job, i barely sleep and had no energy to function. She also had a bad week and want to talk to me about it, however i was to tired to talk to her properly and i just half-assed talking to her. And that was the breaking point, she thought i no longer love her and her feeling for me started to go away. After that one week i began talking to her normally again, but she didn't seem like she want to talk. She said that she was sick and don't want to talk so i told her to remember to take her medicine, i dont want her to get sick, and i stopped calling her, yet still message her everyday. She never reply. One day I asked her and she told me that she no longer love me.The whole world crashing down on me. I begged, I cried, I explained to her everything, she wouldn't give me a chance. I was gonna ask her to marry me next summer, now everything is gone. I cried for the whole week, many time i was so close to commiting suicide but i held back because maybe i can still win her back. So I kept caring for her, talking to her although she never reply. I thought if I show her how much i really love her she will change her mind. Until one day i found out she already got a new lover before she broke up with me, and that crushed me. I asked her if she has anything going on with that person, and she agressively refused to answer. She told me that do i want to control her, that i always think what i want to think and never listen to her, she never did anything wrong, and she can answer it but she doesn't want to. My heart broke, i just want her to admit it herself so i know that she is still truthful with me, but she couldn't do it. I show her the proof and she change her tone, she said she couldn't lie to me so she couldn't said no. I felt like she has been lying to me for a long time. But i can't bring myself to be angry at her, i still love her so much. She came to me when i was in my darkest moments, she was the hope, the light that help me overcome everything. When she left, she took away all of that, now i'm alone with my own depression, when my mom saw me crying because of her, she told me to kill myself. I was closer to the edge than ever, i just want her back, i begged her and her new lover to let her comeback to me, that obviously failed. I talked to a lot of people, they all tell me that this will past, just try to forget her, everything will be fine .etc. I tried to go on with my normal life but she keep popping up in my head, her voice, her face, her smell, everything, and the depression hit. My kid comeback in my dream and asked me ""Why mom and dad fight? Why you are not together anymore?"". I tried to keep pushing on, I really did, but I can't imagine living a life without her. I can be working and studying 1 moment, and broke down the next moment because her memories came back in my head. I can't keep it going any longer and this time i think i will going through with it. All the pain and humiliation i suffered when i was young, the pain of being away from my friends, the pain of losing my kid, and the pain of losing my love, my hope is too much to bear any longer.","1"

"Back story: after graduating college I had a mental breakdown. I have been having a hard time the past 4-5 months with trying to find new depression meds and they all gave me terrible side effects. On top of this I got diagnosed with a chronic stomach disease that causes terrible nausea and leaves me unable to eat. I was unemployed for 4-5 months and just recently got a good paying job. The jobs turned out to be a shit show and I want to leave it. But I feel like no matter what I do or how hard I try there are always negative consequences. Just in general in my life. Right now Im working a job I was hardly trained for and Im neck deep in unfinished work, unanswered emails and data entry stuff no one ever trained me about. Essentially I dont know how to do my job, no one told me how and they(my bosses)cant answer my questions because they dont know either. Its like they expect magic or something.I left my key yesterday telling myself I wasnt going to go back to work. I then realized wow Im literally fucked if I stay and fucked if I quit. If I stay, Ill wake up everyday with terrible IBS, to the point where I wake up 1.5 hrs early to make sure I have enough toilet time . I cant sleep because of the anxiety. Not even with my sleeping meds. I want to leave the job but if I quit, Ill disappoint my parents and give the impression I cant take care of myself or keep a job. They already have been so sympathetic they text me everyday saying they are proud of me for working. Im so fucking miserable its unhealthy. If I quit I also will have no money- I have 1 months more rent in my bank account and thats it. If I leave I will spend all day feeling sick and feeling bad for myself. I will get extremely depressed and have suicidal thoughts. I know this because thats how it was for 4-5 months when I was unemployed. Being at work distracts me but its miserable.Essentially I cant win either way. Im staying at my shit job, doing the best I can and I know they wont fire me during the holiday season. If they want to they can. Itd be easier than having to quit. So I see no reason to leave other than just major emotional discomfort. I cry at work in the bathroom or in the back area everyday. I cant seem to separate my life from this job. Its full time so its demanding. Thinking about how Im literally going to be miserable either way makes me wonder why Im even living. Damned if I do damned if I dont. Ive been sick and unemployed for so long and if this job goes I think my parents will start thinking Im just an incapable human being. I feel like a burden, a loser, the less talented and smart and successful child. My sister is making 100k a year doing what she loves in NYC. Im in my small town with a chronic illness, major depression and essentially an eating disorder. Shit sucks. ","1"

"I used to always remember my appointment. But its been happening more and more that I miss them or mess them up. A few months ago I arrived at an appointment at 1:30pm when I was supposed to be there at 12:30 noon. Then just a few moments ago I tried to go see a specialist and my appointment was on Tuesday not Thursday. Its hard to get into see this specialist (takes months). I was supposed to see them for my hormone imbalance. Im trying really hard. The other day I had my final for school and at 6am the police came round my house waking me up. Apparently my schizophrenic Mother told them Im in danger (my mum kicked me out onto the street when I was 18). Then my mum keeps calling me saying my dad is murdering people and is going to kill me. She keeps telling me I met up with him, when Ive never even met the guy (I heard from other family members he wasnt a good guy, and was in prison before). So I go to school and work, so Im really busy. Then in my free time basically all I do is sleep, and watch tv shows.  Ive seen therapist but it just seems like so much effort to go there, make an appointment, then come home. I was supposed to go back to work after this specialist appointment. But I really just want to curl into a ball and cry. I feel sick and sad. ","1"

And every emotion I've fought so hard to keep down, comes right back up. It should feel like a compliment and someone please tell me if I'm being unreasonable?

My depression is affecting my relationship and my boyfriend doesn't know how to deal with it. He told me I need to see a professional but I don't really feel like driving somewhere to sit for an hour and pay $15 and feel anxious the whole time. Do they help? I know I'm what's standing in my way but I just am not a strong person emotionally. I'm not strong enough to stand up to this and take control of my life. I'm also not strong physically with my health conditions (POTS, EDS, Gastroparesis). I'm just so tired all the time. And I'm not good at anything anymore.

I am terrible at sports to the point where people make jokes flat out in my face like Yeah hes the best one on the team it just gets annoying.My family puts me down constantly, calling me useless, worthless and similar connotations. I am trying to get a job to prove them otherwise but no jobs even seem interested in me. I come from a family where all of my cousins (who I live with) are smart and then there is just me, I flat out feel remedial compared to them.Im ugly, anti social, pretty poor unless you compare me to a homeless man or something, kinda dumb, etc.Like if I were to give myself one positive it would be that Im nice but that seems to have gotten me nowhere in life or school, Im not even bullied Im just almost entirely ignored asides a few instances like the one I mentioned above about sports. I used to play video games constantly to try and relieve my depression for awhile but now Ive reached depression to the point where I dont feel too entertained by video games anymore. My teachers have little faith in me at all, Im taking 3 honors classes right now but I was never recommended, I just kinda forced myself in there and one even admitted to thinking I was not suited for it. I dont have a dad, my mom is constantly at work so I practically live with my aunt.

"Hey all,Thanks for reading this first of all. It might not be the best place to post for reasons to stay alive as I understand many of you struggle with the same problems as I do, but at least I think you understand my desire to end it all.Right now I have struggled with a very severe form of Crohns disease for the past 15 years, and the past 3 years no meds have been working so I have been switching from one to another and have had two near death experiences as a bonus. Right now I am on the last straw, if this med does not help I need major surgery and they will remove my colon. If that would solve it I would be ok with it, but Crohns can return after surgery. And then there are no meds for me, so that would mean more surgery. And at the rate of my illness now, I could expect at least two surgeries a year.I dont want this shit. I am 30. When I just had my involuntary near death experiences they motivated me to stay alive, but now I am just tired. I even regret fighting to stay alive. What life is this? I am on the toilet 30 times a day at worst, I have constant pain, I am autistic on top of this all so I dont have much of a social life either and basically all I do is survive. I feel like the only reason I keep on going because I dont want my mom to suffer and she would if I die. But I dont want to go through this hell either. There is absolutely no reason why things would get better at this point. They basically can only get worse. I feel like quitting my blood thinners (which is keeping the near death experiences at bay) and just letting an embolus kill me as that seems the easy way out compared to a life full of major surgeries, prednisone and loneliness. I just had enough. So is there anyone here who can tell me that I will think it is worth it at some point? Who has been through something similar? ","1"

"I'm hopeless. Trapped not because there's no way out, but because I am out. Nothing to challenge, nothing to solve, nothing to break free from, yet still trapped more than ever. I feel a strong urge to just burst, but nothing comes out. No longer caring about anything, i find myself caring about everything. It all crashes down on me, placing more pressure on me, yet it isn't the reason I'm trapped. I'm trapped by my self. So much to do yet there's no way I do it. It may get done by me, but I won't have done it. My autopilot is on, although I'm physically in this world, my mind is in a darker place. This disconnect between my mind and my body confuses and frustrates me, yet my anger towards myself masks itself in sadness and hopelessness. I don't care for myself anymore nor love myself. All I care about is those who love me, and that's enough for now. But will it always be? I have no desire to do anything, attend anything, eat anything, play anything. All I desire is for the weight to be lifted off my shoulders. This invisible weight that no one sees, making it 10x heavier. It's both my responsibility and my downfall. I'm expected to hide it yet solve it. Carrying it through daily activities as if I'm like everyone else, when on the inside I know I'm broken. I believe I might get fixed, but I don't even remember what being normal is like. I don't even remember the last time I was truly happy and not thinking of anything else. I try to be happy each morning, but it doesn't take long for the miserable gloom to kick in, covering all my thoughts like a cloud. My eyes are usually full of tears before I even realize my attempt to be happy has failed. It's a cycle of depression, with moments of feeling like it's fake, but hours of feeling it's pain.","1"

I don't even want to mention the fact that one time I would eat the entire fridge and other times I cannot put anything in my mouth for like 2 days. Most of the time I just find myself sleeping during the day just to... I don't know, hang around I guess. Sometimes I think of ending it all, I just feel like I have nothing to look forward to. Talking with other people has been hard as well. I remember as a kid I wanted to accomplish things, be happy etc. but now I feel... numb, I think. Nothing is any fun anymore.

Recently, I've been more upset that I have never had a close circle of good friends. There are groups everywhere, and people don't see me as good enough to ever be considered one of them. Anything I've tried to be involved in, I'd be the person that was simply tolerated. Nobody would make any effort to know me or get me involved, I'd get pushed away at any attempt I'd make. I can't fit it, and I don't understand why.I'm really down because recently, I discovered that some of my online 'friends' made a group chat, and have kept me out of it. It's really hurt me, especially at a time where I'm hurting for friends. I wish people would just tell me what's wrong with me, or why everyone seems to avoid me. It's so frustrating, I don't know what I'm doing wrong, or why everyone treats me like this. It makes me feel like I'm less than human, and I just don't have any kind of worth to anyone.

A smarter person than me will come up with 10 ideas on the spot). I probably can't do anything creative for a similar reason as before. I have terrible hand-eye coordination. I have barely any social skills, so it's not like I have people in my life to abide my time with. Too afraid to start a business. Too afraid to travel (I hate airplanes). Never go out due to lack of friends. Get bored reading books since 1/2 seem to be too dumb for me and the other 1/2 difficult for me to understanding, so I give up.I'm pretty plain looking and not willing to have casual sex, so there's no way I can participate in the current ""hookup"" culture and find a mate.I'm also sincerely jealous of people who are religious. I can't bring myself to believe in God no matter how much I try. I also fail at being Buddhist or follow any path with diligence since I get back into my depressive modes and give up. I accept the fact that I'll always be depressed and selfish, and can't just use other's suffering as a way to boost myself up and not feel bad all the time. I just don't know what to do anymore. Can't afford a therapist at the moment since parents aren't doing too well financially. ","1"

In like the past 3 or 4 days i have been my normal self and then randomly in bursts between 1-4 hours i feel this dark cloud come over me. I feel this indescribable sadness and my mind races at times until i get a headache, other times I just feel down and i have no clue why. Whenever i try to be happy during these times i literally cant no matter how i try, my chest just feels like its sinking and i cant do anything about it. At times during these 1-4 hours i have lots of suicidal thoughts or thoughts of doing hardcore drugs to sooth myself or OD. Then whenI think about why I'm having these thoughts i literally cant find a reason why. I just want to sleep all the time too. As soon as the 1-4 hours ends I feel like a giant weight has just been lifted or some sort of being just left my body, but afterwards I'm still fucked up about what just happened. I don't really feel the need to tell others because they either wont understand, wont believe me, or take it as some sort of joke.

"Hello. I am an 18 year old male, just recently graduated high school and will be starting Community College in January. I live with my grandma and uncle due to my mother being a drug addict. My uncle had a girlfriend who lived with us but we eventually kicked out because she is an alcoholic. For some reason my family decided to let her come back into our family. Anyways, my grandma fell in the bathroom over the past weekend and got seriously injured. She is going to be at a rehab center for about 20 days. She hoards so the House is sort of a mess. My uncles girlfriend decided she wants me to spend the rest of my break before college doing nothing but cleaning the house. My family doesnt want to do Christmas this year, I cant even go out with friends cuz Im constantly cleaning the house every day now. When my grandma comes home someone has to help her walk around and do everything for her. Im the only person whos young and in good health in the home so of course It will have to be me, which Im happy to do, but thats going to take away so much time Ill need especially if Im in college. Long story short the rest of my break is gone, Im depressed, and I have no idea how on earth Im going to have time for college, helping my grandma, and having friends all at the same time. Im going to have to stay home and be ready to cater to her needs at any point. Like I said Im happy to do that because I love her but this is going to have a big impact on my life.

I'm still dealing with things that have hurt me deeply these past 8 years and I'm so tired I can't even think of the future. When I say I'm tired I mean I am so exhausted but still cannot sleep. I've been trying to get help but have been getting nowhere with therapy. Can't get a scheduling to check my thyroid until next week and hopefully I'll get my blood work done on Saturday. Just want something simple to fix, I don't want to keep guessing.","1"
"From people closing the door in my face after taking the wrong order, to restaurants taking 2 hours to reimburse me (restaurant delivery), I just cannot deal with people anymore. And what's with people having non-existent spatial awareness? Can you not see me to the point that I have to walk in the street just to pass people on the sidewalk? Or is it they don't care? I mean, my therapist is at a loss as to why I haven't made efforts to go to meetups, but I'm to the point of fully accepting being anti-social. I'll never be loved. I'll never be liked. And I'll never be appreciated. I'm not sure  what keeps me from doing a 1800 splash off a bridge. But for some reason, I gotta keep going. Maybe it'll get better. But I'm not getting any younger. I'll always be the case of untapped potential, it seems. ","1"

"Here I am at 23. I have good friends, good family, good job, etc. but am definitely not normal. I am not real with anyone in my life every aspect has a different face I put on. I dont talk to coworkers, classmates, or roommates. Any time attention is on me I blush. Never had a girlfriend, despite kinda trying for a few months (meeting up and just hooking up with ppl via tinder/bars even so I have a lot of difficulty doing this due to not knowing how) but just dont really have the desire its just me trying to be normal. Been dealing with terrible social anxiety and depression my whole life. Lately been doing a lot of introspection trying to figure out where this stemmed from besides a family history of mental health. I have ended up pinpointed one aspect of my life that unknowingly has had a important affect...being forced to sit alone at an allergy table throughout elementary school. This along with all the other side effects of having a deadly food allergy in a world where it was a new concept probably created a me vs them mentally and hindered social behavior. Sometimes I think I may have aspergers/austim cause of my inability to get over social issues and connect with most people","1"

"I don't know what to do. This is literally ruining my relationship. I've been with my current boyfriend for over 3 years now, and we even talk about getting married, but my depression is ruining everything. I don't have many friends, and I don't want to put more stress on my boyfriend. I don't have anyone I can talk to about this. On days I don't work or have school I try to hard to do things around the house to help out, but I barely have the energy to take the trash out. Getting out of bed is so hard to do every day. I don't remember the last time I felt happy to wake up and just feel alive. I feel like I'm just pushing him to his limit, until he finally snaps and breaks up with me.  He's been so understanding of me for so long, and it's just getting harder for him to deal with this. Today he got mad at me because I didn't finish cleaning the room. And I get it. We've had talks about this before and I promised him I would try harder.It's hard for him to understand that it's a struggle for me to get out of bed, and that I'm not just completely lazy.  I don't know what I'm doing to do when he realizes that I'm not worth all of this added stress on him. I don't know how to fix myself.","1"
"Last night durning a therapy session I made the stupid mistake of talking about my kinda poor relationship with food.Basically i'm underweight guy ( by about 14 pounds maybe more) & this sometimes gets to me cos a 36 year old 6ft guy really shouldn't weigh 140 poundsAnyway long story short every time i tell myself to eat more I always fear that i'll just wont stop and become overweight and I stupidly told my therapist that if that happened then I would destroy myself but I dunno where this fear of having a few extra pounds came from she already knows that i deprive myself food as a form of self harm , but i never told her of the guilt i feel if I ever give in and eat a big meal and that the following day no matter how hungry I feel I'd make sure to eat less than the usual small amount to make up for itEG: had a KFC the other day , so the next day i skipped breakfast , had a really small lunch and dinner and felt pretty hungry going to bed I regretted the instant i started to talk about it cos to be honest i cant explain why I feel like this ","1"
"Hi there. I'm here to ask for help. I have a close friend and colleague who acknowledges he has depression, but is not taking medication or seeing a therapist. He's been in a very forgiving space with his job for the last ten years, but is now on the edge of getting fired. He is very loved by his colleagues, but is alienating everyone. I think his marriage is okay, but his wife places a lot of pressure on him that doesn't seem to help. In essence, the problem is that he oscillates between blaming his depression for his problems and blaming everyone around him. To given an example: he'll say that the reason he can't get something finished (or started) is because he hasn't been given sufficient direction or support at one point, but when that doesn't suffice or whatever roadblock he's point to is removed, he'll say it's because of his depression. I'm really concerned that he's getting to the point of no return. His bosses have  essentially told him to get his act together or find another job. I think this starts with him genuinely getting help for his depression - whatever that help might be - but I get the sense that he would rather attribute his state on external factors than do the hard work of dealing with himself. What can I do? Any help would be really, really appreciated. ","1"

"Been on a good come up lately, lots of money. Just bought my first car too, but none of the money I spend makes me happy. If anything, it makes me feel worse. My job lead me down a weird path in life, functioning cocaine addict and all. Literally can't get out of bed without a line, and if I don't have it I'll have a panic attack. My fiancee left me recently, and since then I've just become more successful. But that doesn't even make me happy any more. Ever since I've been making good money, I feel like people I've known for 10+ years are starting to hate me, and it's not the drugs because nobody knows about that. People I used to see every day suddenly don't have the time any more, even tho they have the same schedule as before. I've gotten other friends on the same level as me but they're not good people. I'm not a religious person really, but if there is a hell I'm sure I'm going there. I donate a lot to charity to try and make up for it, or maybe just to make myself feel better, but the good feelings I get from it only last a few minutes. I've never really been depressed in my life before but I think that's what I'm falling into. It's hard for me to get motivated for things these days, and I just feel a constant ball in my throat like I'm going to be sick. I used to be a great person, everybody's friend, but it's hard just to put on a smile now. I used to go out with my friends every day, drinks, dinner, movies, etc. But I work from home now so the only time I leave is to buy groceries and run errands. Shit, I can't even force myself to clean my house, I hired a maid just to do that. I don't like who I've become, but at the end of the day I gotta pay my bills. It's weird because I grew up really poor, always wanted to be rich, but now I'd give all of my money just to be happy. Sounds kind of like a movie, or a sad song haha. Anyway that's my rant, maybe someone out there who's gone through the same thing can offer a piece of advice. ","1"

"So I attempted suicide last spring by ingesting antifreeze. Life was very tough no money etc. Since then I picked myself up and I can now manage my money better and I dont fight with my wife any more.I am more calm but there is still one issue that I am kind of embarrassed to deal with...A year before my attempt I found the office job of my dreams where I have no pressure or stress as long as I finish my work by the end of the day which only takes me 2hours. My office is inside the warehouse so the warehouse coworkers come and ask me questions when I release their work if there is something wrong usually with inventory.Everyone is nice except for the second shift team leader. That guy in the beginning seemed nice but as time went by and he found out I was an introvert he became more intrusive asking me personal questions and complain about my mistakes in front of the supervisor or manager. This along with other personal problems at home is what drove me to attempt suicide.Now I think the guy has personality problems he is in his late 20's and makes fun of the older people by calling them old to their face. I think that because im younger he does not like me also he got married because he got his wife pregnant at 17 and I got married a year before my son was born and also I moved in with my wife right into an apartment. In the other hand he had to live with his parents until he was stable.Anyways im a nice guy to everyone no matter what they look like I treat everyone how I would treat myself. The team leader last year told me that he used to be a bully in high school and later he started giving me wet willies and pat my back hard when he would greet me. And often he would say ""one day you are going to stand up to me and cuss me out""  After a while he stopped acting like that but he still kept putting me on the spot in front of my supervisors and manager whenever I did the smallest mistakes in my paperwork. This caused me to not get a raise this year because he is trusted by th manager and they both go fishing often also he is the only good worker that we have in the warehouse everyone else makes mistakes too often.Earlier today he brought me a piece of paper that needed a detailed note and he told me -Fix it!I said -this is already fixed.Then he got mad and told me-fuck did you just say? I told you to fix it!I stayed quiet and my supervisor fixed it for meHow can I stop him treating me like crap? Im stressed out right now and my anxiety is not helping me focus at work. I hope this text doesnt have too many errors but I cant focus at the moment.","1"

"Created a reddit account for the first time ever today because I need to a place to just air this shit out:I find myself frequently having thoughts of different ways I could commit suicide and how easy it would be to do it. At the same time I recognize how selfish suicide is and I DO NOT want to do it. I know when I'm down the mantra is that ""this will pass"" but that doesn't mean it doesn't suck. And I know that killing myself doesn't solve any problems, it just eliminates me from the solutions -- my kid still needs a father, etc.I guess that's really the sum of it - I've gone really dark but I know I need to find a way back out because people are counting on me and I can't be who they need to be if I'm gone.","1"

"I won't be suprised if nobody reads it, I'm used to people giving shit about me, but i think that a little bit of foolish hope has brought me here...I always was an pesimist, i always though that if i assume the worst-case scenario, I'll be prepared and ready to deal with everything, i was wrong, I was terribly wrong. I live in Poland, and i just turned 18. I had good, but hard childhood, everyone liked me, my family wasn't poor, and still i can have almost everything i can ask about. But i had horrible problems primary school, and my parents forced me to learn for 4 or 5 hours each day, when other children were playing and hanging out with each other, i always hated it, and in result i hate and refuse to study something I'm forced to until today. But still my times in primary school and middle school were good when everyone liked me, i even almost found love and almost got a girlfriend there (which i would rather not find for my own sake). But everything started to fuck up in high school. Me and my friend from middle school in which i fell in love (and she propably fell in me) got an serious argument and lost contact, i have broken my knee and went through surgery which effectively immobilised me for half a year and made fat, the one guy that followed me from primary school destroyed my reputation and convinced everyone into hating me and making fun of, because of that i had to change school (and serious maths problems) and for fucks sake from all of people i had to hit into a class full of good friend of my previous one, so my torment of being made fun of is continued which effectively made me aggresive, closed and paranoid. In second year i though that everything will start to become better, me and my friend reunited, she propably was still in love with me because she said she missed me, at least some thing were going quite good, but not for long...after a few weeks she told me that our old friend is propably in love with her, and some time later he gave up and stopped texting her, and then she snapped (propably same as me, she has never been in a relationship, and she realised that she lost another guy) so for a whole month i was basically her therapist and only support, i wanted to tell her that i still love her, but i couldn't. After a month our friend organised his 18th birthday party, me and she got drunk, she wanted me to get drunk that other guy who loved her and ask him ""what the fuck does he want"", and i did, he told he gave up, and he doesn't care anymore, when i told her about that, she started crying, her other friend went to talk with this guy, and i talked with them, and because i was drunk, i was stupid enough to push them both outside and talk, and now they're in almost year long relationship. I don't know why, their relationship is driving me mad, even if i know i will be able to get another woman, if one will show up (which doesn't) but knowing that i fucked up everything, that i lost a very beautiful and intelligent woman, drives me mad and into thinking that I will never find anyone, we barely talk anymore because her boyfriend has priority and she has a lot of studying, and it drives me mad. I'm in a 3rd year of high school now, and it's terrible, everyone turned away from me, i have serious problem with my marks, no motivation to study, and my parents gave me a lot extra lessons, and in result i barely have time to do something for myself, i feel like a broken slave, i want to die, and i don't know what to do to stop feeling that constant pain, frustration and shitty feeling. I tried professional help, and it hadn't worked, parents and few friend left tells me that my university time will be better, but I'm afraid it never will be better","1"

"Warning: Extremely longI play a game called FFXIV and I also follow the reddit. Yesterday someone shared a story about hoe the game saved their life and I posted a little about my story. I was afraid to share everything since it wasn't an appropriate thread so I got directed to this thread and I hope it's okay if I post my story here...I graduated high school back in 2014, I went right into college thinking that was the correct path. At the time I had a boyfriend who went to a different college 3 hours away from me. He was my longest relationship of 3 months, the other 2 only lasted 2 weeks. While I was happy at first, I slowly began to hate it...He never called me beautiful or said he loved me even though he would call other girls beautiful in front of me and I would tell him I loved him. I have no self esteem and I just wanted him to once think I was something. So once I get into school he visits me and dumps me. I was torn down, for a very trivial reason, but it hurt me a lot. I began to party, I would drink a lot and sleep around to try and make myself feel better but it didn't work. I started sneaking alcohol in my room and crying until 4 in the morning, writhing from the emotional pain, wishing I would just die already.I started getting noise complaints and had to see therapists when they found out the noise was me crying every night. I hope I don't offend anyone who may be a therapist...but THIS therapist was horrible. Like I said I play video games and I tell them that is how I cope with my emotional turmoils. They told me that it was not healthy and even though I'm an introvert I have to become an extrovert. When I explained I don't like big group settings they insisted I do it anyways. Needless to say I stopped seeing them.Christmas break is almost here and I need to sign up for the next semester classes. I don't remember what the building was on campus but they handled some form of paperwork. While I'm waiting a lady asks if I am okay. You ever have those moments where it's fine up until someone asks if you're okay? That was that moment. I broke down and she took me to a room and let me vent. I told her everything and she listened and she was more of a therapist than the other person. She asked me what I wanted to do and I told her I can't be here right now, I'm not ready for any of this. Soon after I went back home and started working.I started out at fast food then became a waitress then finally retail. October 2016 I was still at that retail job when all hell broke loose and my life has been fucked ever since.I have a sister who is a few years older than myself. Married, 2 kids age 5 and 2 now, y'know. Well things break down with their marriage and she suddenly moves in with my parents and I, kids included. At first I hurt because even though my sister mentally abuses my mom and I, I guess I still love her. I was angry remembering her happy wedding and seeing her cry so much I wanted her to be happy again.So at first our family does what a family should, we help her. Slowly we rebuild her, she gets a job, and things are looking up. Except she doesn't help us buy food for her and her kids, we buy her diapers, provide clothing, pay lawyer fees, etc. That's okay to start off with but she does not pay us back at all and she abuses it too. She wastes her money on a PS4 since I wouldn't let her use mine, goes to concerts, buys jewelry, you get the point.After awhile I get to this point where I begin to experience what I think are panic attacks, or something similar. One day I get fed up with my sister always being loud and letting her kids do whatever they want and I go downstairs to my parents and I started crying before I essentially black out? Next thing I know I'm looking up at the ceiling and my mom is stroking my head. My jaw felt numb or like it wasn't even there, my head feels cold and tingly and my body is tensed up. I was scared. I think about hoping I could die so I don't have to deal with these issues anymore but I'm also afraid of dying.I had work that day and if that really was a panic attack I had earlier I can only describe this next part as continually going through a mini panic attack while at work. My jaw would randomly go numb, I would slur my words and my hands kept shaking. I eventually went to talk to my manager about this and they did not care whatsoever. They told me I'm at work that's all I have to focus on or I can just leave and find somewhere else to work. Thankfully I leave a few months later.Now it's May 2016 and I got a new job. This is the best place to work, sit down and make calls, fun events, the managers care so much about my mental wellbeing that I got referred to a program just for working there that I can use for free. But of course things back home still suck. I eventually get fed up with my sister living their with her kids and I start yo close myself in because I feel heartless. Now my thoughts are, ""She can afford to live in an apartment with her kids, she makes so much more money than I do and she can get assistance."" ""I hate how the kids scream and run inside they house. Not to mention they kick and bite drawing blood and leaving bruises."" ""I don't care about my sister or her kids, I only care about my parents and myself.""This starts to eat away at me. These are my true feelings and I am so fucking disgusted I would think thoughts like those. But I am fed up with how my sister always abuses us and has bullied me growing up. I could care less, I want her to leave my family alone, if not my parents could fucking die from this. They suffer from PTSD due to military service, mom has fibro, memory issues, she is constantly in physical pain. On the other hand my dad has schizophrenic-like episodes, anger issues, and experiences petit mal seizures under extreme stress. All I want is for my life to be normal again. I was depressed to begin with and I can't tell you how many times I've wished I had no emotions during this whole divorce shit show.My sister continues to abuse us same as always and it gets to a point where I tag along with my mom to her therapists one morning. I tell her all these things and my mom loses it. I tell my mom she needs to find a place to live and that finally pushed my mom to give my sister a moving out day. Things are good for maybe a week, but only because the piece of shit biological father had them that whole week. When they come back my parents are the free babysitters.I love my niece and nephew but I hate kids. I never want them myself. Never. I can't stand how they're always screaming, crying, hitting, kicking, biting, banging on my door trying to invade my room. I feel like such a piece of shit it isn't their fault but they make my angry so I don't try to interact with them too often.I eventually reach my 2nd week of work at my new job before I realize I'm suddenly in pain. A lot of pain. Thinking it may be my IBS I just do some stretches and take a painkiller but it won't go away. Leave work early only for the ER to say I have appendicitis and need surgery the next day, putting me out of work for a week. Thankfully my job understands and the managers all sign me a get well soon card, which was super sweet. But my sister does not understand.I couldn't do a single thing on my own while on bed rest. Bathroom? I need to be carried. Hungry? Someone has to make it for me. I would constantly fall asleep due to the medication they gave me and I needed to push a lot of water so I was under constant supervision. Since this was the case my parents told my sister to try to get a babysitter that week and man oh man what a shit storm that was. My sister looked at me and said I was faking it and I didn't have surgery, she said that I should just watch her kids for this week since I won't be at work. So what happens next? My mom can't handle the pressure and we have to call 911 after she suffers what we call one of her ""spells."" She becomes unresponsive, she drools, she doesn't know who she is or where she is, doctors also think she suffers from stress induced seizures too. I end up having to go across the street to my neighbors (my dad HAD to go with my mom there was no way she could be alone), both military personnel who were more than happy to help much to my embarrassment.Now it's basically December 2017 and my sister is still abusing us, she skipped work a lot and acted sick so we would take care of her kids, she isn't paying any of her bills, she doesn't feed or bathe her kids just like their father, we still pay her lawyer, she has neglected the children a lot lately so we basically feed them, bathe them, watch them 8 hours a day Mon-Fri while she is ""at work"" and I'm going to work, going home, and wanting to just fucking end it all.I struggle to use video games as an escape now. This may sound very pointless and stupid but when I play a game if I don't do a pattern correctly I can't play it anymore. To give an example, with the FFXIV game I play, when I level up I had to do A > B > C and go back to D. If I mess up the order once, my chest begins to feel tight and I can't do it anymore. If I have a quest that says, ""Kill 20 mobs"" and I kill 21, it bothers me and I can't enjoy it anymore so I either quit or just force myself to play and not even enjoy it. I have never had this weird ""pattern"" issue before now and it's ruining the only thing I have left in my life.I don't know what to do anymore, I don't want emotions, I'm afraid to kill myself and I'm afraid of dying but I simultaneously want something to happen that I have no say in. I hate how heartless I've become, I should be wanting my sister and her kids to have a normal life but I don't care I want my family and I to have a normal life.I'm so sorry for the long post, I'm afraid to talk to people in real life about my issues and venting all of this has to be done or else I'll just suddenly explode one day and break down...","1"

"This is the beginning of the end. My mind is split on everything, like two or three people beside my self live in my head. I imagine them as two beings resting on my back whispering in my ear. My mind does not stop worrying about everything. I think about offing myself constantly. When I cut I feel euphoric for 1-3 days. I want to run away from my life. I think of killing others too. I woke up at 5 in the morning and started insulting myself. Im just tired of my mind not working. Sometimes I almost cry wanting to have a girl to hug; not in a  poor me I have no gf boo-hoo sort of way, I just want to have someone to hold, someone with a beating heart to feel.

"In the real world if you open up about your problems to others they tend to either change how they behave around you and distance them selves or tell you to go elsewhere to get help. Online we're forced to only talk about it in subs like these. That leads to people with emotional issues to be ""quarantined"" and only be around each other. While there's nothing wrong with everybody here sharing their problems and relating, if somebody wants advice it's hard to get new ideas from others who are still struggling themselves. I believe that isolating us only makes things worse. As far as therapy in the real world, It's just somebody's job. You can't tell if they really care to help you or are just going through the motions because that's their paycheck. I understand that only we can fix our own problems but it's almost impossible with zero outside help. ","1"

"Basically says it in the title, I'm just looking for some insights/support from anyone else who has experienced this. I recently, like within the last 2 weeks, have curtailed my alcohol abuse dramatically. From 8-12 drinks per night every night to 2-3 since last Sunday. Only had 1 beer last night. I knew that it was going to hurt mentally in terms of increased anxiety and depressed thoughts/feelings, but yesterday and today have been really bad. I feel like I could cry at any moment, everyone thinks I suck, I'm not worthy of happiness, etc.  I know this is typical. I've been through it before when I've tried this and have always gone back to abusing the drinks. I really want to make this attempt stick and I feel like in my head, I have more strength and motivation this time than ever before. I'm done with feeling shitty all the time, I want to reclaim my happy life! Can anyone relate? How did you stick to your guns and get through it? Any and all responded are appreciated. ","1"
"After months of being on this medication that has completely taken every ounce of hope from my body, taken all energy and turned it into negative, my body drove me to attempt at my own life today. In the face of the end, which I saw face to face, I felt nothing. I just thought, oh. The attempt ended unsuccessfully. After pleading to my doctor to take me off this combination that has increased my ideation of death and drove me to (now) attempt, I have had to come to the conclusion my doctor does not want to assist, I have to get myself off the medication. My doctor gave up on me already, so Im giving up on her. I have no access to any other doctor and dont want to see her, as shes become annoyed with my lack of success with repeated antidepressant trials. I cant help how my body reacts.

"I had a panic attack during a marching band audition, causing me to completely blank on the memorized piece. I explained what happened to leadership, but they told me they didn't care, and gave me an alternate spot. I've been an alternate every year I've been in this band, save for about 2 weeks last year. Strangely, the leadership has never given me an explanation as to why I've been an alternate for this long. It's usually a 1 year max, but this is my 2nd year. It's also my last year getting to play in the marching band. I've tried talking to them about it, but they won't even look at me while we're talking, and act like they're walking on egg shells. I went to the directors, but they waited too long to make a decision, and we'd already learned half the show. It ended up triggering a 3 day depressive episode and several panic attacks. And I missed turning in 4 big assignments that week. It's been about a month since then, and I still get upset about it, crying before nearly every practice and performance, 6 days per week. They gave 2 new members spots over me, 1 of them can't even play the pieces we perform at every game, including the school fight song, and is one of the worst marchers in the section. Before we auditioned, leadership was complimenting me on my marching and music, but here we are.","1"

"There's so much on my mind, but every thought leads to suicide. I want help, but I'm too apathetic to explain my mess of a life and mind again. It doesn't lead to anything, and my nihilistic perspective means it doesn't matter anyway. I'm going to die one day, it might as well be soon. I can no longer think of any reason to stay and I feel... calm. It feels like instead of depression driving my suicidal tendencies as it used to, it's acceptance. i can't gather the will to fight against it anymore. i just want to tidy myself up a bit and write a few christmas cards. I'm just holding myself back day to day, solemnly wondering if I'd change my mind but it doesn't feel like it. I've lost track of time but I think I've been like this for? a few weeks? between 2-5 weeks. Maybe I'm just a little bit afraid of the pain. But I'm really looking forward to not existing. I'm so exhausted. I'm so damn exhausted of living. It feels pretty much the right time to die now. ""but you have so much to live for!"" - but I feel like I've lived through enough. I'm happy with what I've experienced. I don't need anymore, especially with how everything is tainted. ""it will hurt the people around you"" - people are hurt by all sorts of things. I hope my parents hurt. I havent got any close friends. Maybe yes people will feel my absence for a few months, maybe a year, but its not like I would care at that point, and thats such a small time and then they'll get on with their lives. I'm not that important. I just can't see a reason to stay alive?Anyway, my question has more to do with how many become suicidal from apathy specifically. before now its always been suicidal from hatred of myself, and a want to cause myself more pain and hurt and that I was terribly alone. But now? I'm calm and rational, sometimes less depressed than usual, yet death is CONSTANTLY on my mind, and I've accepted everything.","1"

"Hi, as the title says. my main problems are low self confidence, GAD, along with that some obessive thoughts, lack of energy, motivation, i think alot about shit that brings me down, my mind is on the highway 24/7. Different degrees of ""brainfog"" from day to day. Im probably depressed aswell. Anyway, earlier i ate a combo of prozac and wellbutrin, guess it helped me some, but not just enough imo. I got really depressed this last summer, stopped eating all the pills, went to the doctor and said that those pills arent helping me enough, so she gave me lexapro, instead of prozac and wellbutrin on that aswell. I have a very hard time believing the doctor, and its almost like im looking for side effects, anything i do it just feelt wrong.. Anyway, i didnt eat those pills for a long time, i have been without any AD for a couple of months, until i decided now to take any help they might give me, and follow their advice without any questions. So now im on this new one, called brintellix, does this sound like a good AD for my problems? Whenever i dont eat AD i get this thougts my life would me so much better without them, and vice versa... probably a part of GAD/OCD? Cause some of my problems, speaks for low dopamine and or noradrenaline, while some for low serotonin, but ive heard wellbutrin can increase anxiety, and i dont want that, while ive heard SSRI lowers you dopamine. My english isnt perfect :p Anywya why did he give me brintellix, does that sound right for my issues? Or should i go back to wellbutrin and prozac? ","1"
"Everything I do feels off. Everything I say feels like it's coming from someone else. Every time I laugh it feels like I'm faking it. I can't take this anymore. I'm not interested in anything or anyone anymore. I zone out when people talk to me because I just don't care. Not that I want to be like that but there's just something in me that tells me that whatever someone is saying or whatever I am doing is completely pointless. My voice feels flat. I took a depression quiz and wouldn't be able to put this feeling into words until I took this quiz but that is exactly how I feel. I'll just be talking and halfway through I'll just lose interest in what I'm saying and everyone else will too. It just doesn't sound like its coming from me. My mind is cloudy. I can't think straight anymore. I can barely maintain a conversation. My favorite place is in my bed dreaming because I don't have to wake up to the reality that I'm in. I can't talk to anyone about it. How do I tell someone about this? ""Hey uhh I'm depressed"". That would only cause more issues. People wouldn't understand unless they were in my shoes. I know I definitely wouldn't have understood it before I had it. I didn't used to be like this. I used to be funny, confident, outgoing. I had flaws but not like these. I can't take it anymore. I don't think I'd ever be able to go through with killing myself but I'm not going to lie when I cross an intersection deep down i hope I just get hit by a car and die. ","1"
"For almost two weeks I have been extremely depressed. It started the weekend before Thanksgiving. I was getting behind on bills so my boyfriend offered to loan me money to stay afloat. I had no choice (I have already taken out two loans against my 401k and two other loans from banks) so I took it. He makes good money and says it is not a problem for him, and I truly believe him. I know how much he makes vs how much he spends and that he is still living very comfortably even with giving me the money.Fast forward to last week, my cat got extremely sick and needed treatment that cost almost $1k. My boyfriend again offered and paid for everything for her. I am so grateful and thankful for my boyfriend doing that.When I am in my depressed episodes I don't go to work. I work at a bank and get too spaced out to be worth anything when I am depressed. As I deal with people's money (and solving problems related to their money) I just don't go in. I have it set up where as long as I call, I cannot get in trouble for not being there. The time is unpaid but I am not at risk of losing my job.The problem is that I just got paid today and don't have enough to pay my bills. I missed about a month of work over the summer due to another depressed episode, that's why Im so far behind and have taken out so many loans.I feel like a terrible worker. I feel like a terrible cat mom. I feel like a terrible girlfriend. My boss is so understanding and I know I'm so lucky to have my boyfriend to help with my bills. My cat is doing much better too. I just feel so guilty. I'm guilty about missing work and not noticing that my cat was sick. I feel guilty that my boyfriend has to keep bailing me out. I just sit at home and cry and lament all day about what a horrible person I am to the people who care about me. For the first time in a long time I have been having feelings of self harm. I'm so tired of feeling this way. I just want to be better and treat the people who have been so supportive better.Do any of you deal with this terrible guilt? What makes you feel better? ","1"
"I've experienced this since I was about 12 years old. I can't stop longing for the past. Each year that goes by seems to get worse and worse and I long for something from the previous years. Seeing how much time has passed since a certain point disturbs me, and I just can't believe it's been so many years. I don't know what this is. It's like I just can't process time in a normal way. It's like I'm hyper-sensitive to the very idea of time. It feels like home-sickness in a way but is probably more descriptively associated with nostalgia, except nostalgia seems to be described by most as a happy feeling, but this has always been a really somber feeling. I just moved recently and am now starting to realize that I'll probably never live in my old home again. This has been something that I really haven't been able to shake so far and I'm really afraid that it will follow me forever and make life horrible.","1"

"(I know this is really long but it would mean a lot if you could read the whole thing and give some feedback)Im a 17 year old male. Im not sure how i should feel anymore, some days Im happy and enjoy simple things, other days i feel so worthless and depressed i dont even feel like getting out of bed. I have no type of connection or bond with anyone at all whatsoever. I at most just have aquantninces at school that i just make small talk with and crack the occasional joke. The thing that confuses me is I honestly dont know why nobody likes me. Im not saying Im perfect or anything but Im laid back, have a sense of humor, open minded and Im nice. I have even been told so. It makes me feel so shitty when i see people talking about plans they make together, talking about memories they made, taking funny pictures together and bonding. I just sit there thinking to myself why the fuck cant i have something so simple as this. Just a genuine friendship with someone. How awesome would it be to have a group of close friends or just a close friend i could invite for a sleepover, bring snacks, watch movies and spend the whole night having a blast? Or how awesome would it be to plan a road trip with someone and just have an adventure and reminisce about it later? How awesome would it be feel like your important to somebody, and that you matter to them? Im just not the type of person that likes being alone. My mom assumes that the reason why Im alone all the time is because i just have a lone wolf type of personality but its not true at all. I want to have a best friend or at least have good friends but i dont feel a bond with anyone because nobody is willing to get to know me and bond with me. I love my family but i dont have much of a bond with them if that makes sense. I have nothing in common with them and we all have different personalities with different mindsets and ways of thinking so thats leads to a lot of arguments and days of us not even speaking to each other. My mother is very loving, and she is honestly the only person and women in my life that makes me feel like i matter, but in the back of my mind i know its only because i happen to her son, and that a mother will always love her child. But its love thats given, and i want someone to care and love about me because they willingly want to, not because they are biased because of blood relation. It gets me thinking, do i really have to be someones child,brother, or sister to get them to care about me? Im definitely appreciative of my mom, dont get the impression that i treat her badly because i dont, but my point still remains. Finding a girl is just out of the question at this point.i have never been anyones crush, never held hands or even had my first kiss or date. I am completely invisible to them, and when I finally do find a girl that is willing to engage in a conversation with me and make eye contact, I can still tell from their body language and overall way of talking that they are not interested in me. I made the huge mistake of thinking a girl would actually be willing go out on a date with me just because we had a convo. I sat at lunch with her with a mutual friend and thats how we met. She was down to earth, laid back and chill, and she was beautiful. I messaged her on snapchat a few months later to catch up and she gave short answers. Assuming she was just busy, I decided to get to the point and asked if she would like to go out sometime. No answer at all. She left me on read. Havent talked since. This happened a year ago and i still feel shitty about it. Whenever i see her at school i feel so fucking shitty. I feel so terrible that i just want to throw up honestly. Its not because Im obsessed with her, it just a depressing reminder of how Im cant bond with anyone and it sucks that this girl i had a huge crush on had to be an example of that. I have tried everything, whenever Its a day where Im in a good mood and feeling confident it still doesnt change anything. I honestly dont think Im a bad looking dude, i dress well, i dont mean to brag but Im able to afford a lot of nice clothes because my family is wealthy, not living in a mansion, but were definitely financially stable.  Its very rare when i like a girl too, I definitely have high standards because i believe I deserve a quality girl because i really do believe Im worth it, despite this post insecurity is not necessarily an issue for me, so its not confidence. I honestly just want a girl to love me and i love her back, i want us to best-friends at the same time, i want true partnership with a relationship built on trust, respect, loyalty and affection. But most girls my age dont know a clue about any of that or what it means to truly be in love with someone. Sometimes it makes me feel like theres something wrong with me, or that im not worthy of being loved. Why can another guy gain a womens love and affection but not me? I have a fancy car that my mom was nice enough to buy just for me, i got a job to help make payments on it because im not a self entitled brat and i like to earn my possessions. But guess what? I only use it to drive to work, because i have nowhere else to go. Sometimes ill go to chic fil a and eat my food in my car in the parking lot by myself, wondering why the fuck i dont have anyone bumping to music next to me and wondering what the fuck im gonna do with this fancy car. Im not even asking for advice, because i dont think im depressed, i just feel sad sometimes because of this situation, i guess you could say i have my good and bad days. I have become used to walking up in the morning with no message notifications or invites. I have become used to walking in the hallways with girls just walking past me not even looking at me, and ive become used to trying to make a conversation with someone and they just go on their phone and give short answers. It honestly takes two people to bond and connect for any type of relationship be it or romantic or friendship. Sorry for rambling, if you read this whole thing I really do appreciate it, if not thats cool too. Rant over. Goodnight homies","1"
"okay where do I start? - I moved to NY a year ago. I live in my grandma's basement, basically, rent-free. She told me today she has sold the house and the new buyers want it before Christmas. - Not to mention, the same grandma has been diagnosed with breast cancer. We don't know how bad it is. But, we are very close and the thought of losing her makes me upset more than I realize. - I live in NY, I work in NJ. The commute is 5 hours round trip. Since it was my first job out of grad school, I basically didn't have a choice. I had to take it. I work really hard (I've launched a magazine by myself) but I have nothing to show for it. When I took a couple of weeks to go home (then turned into a medical emergency) my boss hired two new full-time people behind my back and basically left me out in the cold. Now, I have to sit there and still do the work I was expected to do and still get paid very very very very very very little. I'm not motivated in the slightest anymore, and I'm basically asking to be let go at this point. - I came to New York to get a job in book publishing and climb up the ladder. Since being at my job (almost a year), I've applied to easily 100+ entry jobs and haven't landed a single interview. I've updated my resume, have written very personal cover letters but still nada zilch. - I'm basically ready to give up on my dreams and just become a receptionist. But, they barely get paid anything. But, I can't afford New York on what I get paid on now. I'm crafting a resume now and I am barely holding it together. - My boyfriend's grandmother died on Friday. She was old but they were close and it's his first time dealing with anyone dying. He's still expected to go to work and carry on as usual but he's angry and mad and he's still grieving. I'm trying to be supportive because I know exactly what he's going through (I've had many people die in my life) and still be a good partner to him. - Moving back home is an option. My parents have made that perfectly clear. But, (as anti-feminist as this sounds) I don't want to leave my partner and the little life I've set up with him. Things are going stupidly well and it makes me feel like I'm back in high school and things are twirly and lovely and terrific. Not to mention, I'd feel like an absolute failure if I were to go back and move back in with my parents. - Did I mention student loans and credit card bills? I'm going to stop there now. I feel like this list is long enough. If anyone has a word of advice, a job offer, or virtual hugs they'd like to give me, I'd really appreciate it. ","1"

At 16 I was diagnosed with depression, severe anxiety and bipolar disorder 2 ( whatever the hell that 2 is supposed to mean) I live with my fianc and his parents and honestly they all make it so much worse. I think about killing myself every single day but I cant do that to my family. I hate how dependent my mom is of my emotional state, if Im mad shes mad, if im feeling depressed shes depressed, if I cry and try to tell her how I feel or whats happening with me, she makes it about herself and ultimately shames me for not being appreciative of the life she gave me. Nothing in life seems enticing, sure memories and experiences, but what after that, what do I do when I have experienced everything I wanted to. The only things I can say I have done in this world that changed for the better was kicking my Xanax and cocaine addiction, finally getting my GED and getting a decent first job at a call center. Speaking of which, Im currently in my local community college to earn my associate in arts degree but fairly enough I dont care, I dont want to do this but dropping isnt an option. Finding a job is almost impossible, I quit my job at the call center because it made me so much more depressed, sitting in a cubicle 9-10 hours a day getting yelled at by not only customers on the phone, but everyone around me. Ive applied to about 12 different places in the last week and I call almost everyday or go in person just to get told if your application meets the requirements well give you a call its hopeless. I guess its my bipolar disorder that makes me think the world will end whenever something happens, even something as minuscule as my fianc talking to a female, any female. I have so many trust issues its literally tearing us apart, worst part of it is he would never cheat on me and I know it, I still treat him like shit whenever I get mad. My attitude has become such a problem in the last 2 years I seriously fear he will leave me. We argue (hard) almost every other day, I can feel it all taking such an enormous toll on my mental. I have come to my wits end I dont know what to do with myself anymore, unmotivated, no desire to do anything, getting so irrationally mad at anything, seeing myself in this situation doing something I dont want to every day, not having a single dollar, getting nagged to do something or chores every time I leave the room, being talked down to.I have tried medicine and it really only made me gain weight, Im unsatisfied with how I look and what Im doing in life and I cant even muster up enough motivation to do something about it. I honestly dont even know what to expect in the comments because it just sounds like Im complaining, Im the biggest if theres something wrong and you know how to fix it, do it believer I cant think of and yet I cant even start to fix my own damn life. I hate myself and I dont know what else to do but suicide.","1"
"I'm 23, I've been looking for one for over an year after dropping out of university cause of a breakup and depression, I've felt better lately even though I have no income and I'm living with my parents.So I found a job today and I feel as depressed as one year ago, it's a job as a factory worker, full time, for only 500 euros/month. It fucking sucks, I need it, my parents would be angrier at me than they already are, but it fucking sucks.I can't deal with the fact that I have to do a repetitive job in a awful place for 8 hours every day, it fucking sucks, it makes me feel worthless and suicidal, I don't want to do it, I really don't want to, I'd kill myself if I wasn't that scared of death, but what's the point in living if I gotta do an awful job the whole day, every day, I can't deal with it, I'm so sad, depressed, I just wanna go back to bed and never get out ","1"

Money that 99.9% of us don't even own anymore, it's like they watch us doing it as some twisted joke.

What do they want though? and why would they watch me? there's nothing special about me I don't even leave the house much....I just wonder if they'll stop watching ever and maybe I'll actually be alone.

"Hi everyone, I figured a good place to start with this would be a little bit of my background. I'm an eighteen year old male from Muncie, Indiana and my situation is one that I think any people will be sympathetic to. I graduated highschool last May, however i wasn't accepted into any of the colleges I applied to due to my tendencies to procrastinate and ignore things that don't challenge my mind to a level I feel worth putting time into. Keep in mind, I'm fully aware of how naive this mindset is now. Anyway, following graduation I decided to move out, live the American dream, work 40 hours and be sufficient. This is what my whole life had previously been living up to and now I'm left with a feeling of sheer emptiness that has been brought on by the loneliness and frustration that comes with this stagnant lifestyle. While I have a girlfriend whom I care very deeply for, I still find disappointment in the mundane and everyday. Observing my friends who were accepted into colleges, they are full of purpose and enjoyment for what they are doing, which only further extenuates this feeling of helplessness and depression. With this in mind, I was hoping reddit might have some meaningful comments or advice as to what I should do to find purpose in my life, or at least a guide in the right direction. While I find myself picking things up easily I never have been able to find that one passion or that thing that i can always go back to, I aspire to be an artist of some kind but can't ever seem to dedicate myself to ant medium as they all have lead to more depression and self doubt.While this is clearly just a lack of motivation and desire, I hope some of you could provide experiences that lead you to find what in this world you wanted to do or at least what steps have lead you to becoming closer.  Thank you","1"

"I'm so sick of it all, my dad was killed in August, we hadn't spoken for two years because he was quite emotionally manipulative and by the end of our relationship he said some awful things and I couldn't continue our relationship, but for years we were super close even though he put us through a lot.I've been through a lot as a person, I'm 28 and I'm a mum and I do my best I really do, but the things that have happened have shaped me aswell, I'm shy, anxious, low self esteem type person, I doubt myself so much, I want to be a happy person, who does a lot, who gets it right. I feel like a failure compared to my siblings, two of them have great jobs, one is getting married next year happily, they have tons of friends and great social lives, I was the black sheep, I moved out young, got in an abusive relationship, got depression and then developed anxiety disorder, I've been sexually assaulted 3 times in my life once by a very close friend, I've been hit, had my life threatened, I've been emotionally manipulated, what is wrong with me why couldn't I spot the threat, I get told I'm too trusting and I do too much for people, I guess a bit co-dependant, but why am I like this but my sister is the opposite, why does she excel in everything she does, and i'm sat struggling for money, I remember one time I went for an appointment and the lady said well at least you did raising your daughter well, and I have, she's confident, funny, kind, does so well at school but her mother is pathetic, I hide my pain from her the best I can, but it's all I've done and I'm only just keeping my head above water.Sorry long post but who else am I going to tell all this to","1"
"On the surface everything looks fine. I have a decent job where I do well and I have my own place to live but that's where it ends. My life has no meaning and no purpose. I've been battling this for a while but tonight I barely held it together on my commute home and had to dig my keys into my hand to focus on something, then I broke down when I got home and locked the door.I'm at an age where the few friends I had are married and have all moved away so I don't have any social life and I don't have anyone to talk to, let alone confide in.Sometimes I just want the screaming in my head to stop so much. At work I put on a cheerful face. I don't want anyone to know how I really feel. Last night was the office party and I shouldn't have gone but went for appearances sake and then it brings it all home to me how isolated I really am and how I can't relate to what goes on at these things.There's literally nothing going on in my life and I've lost the drive to even try to find something to give it meaning now. I don't expect to ever be happy but I don't want to keep living like this.Is there anything you can do on your own to combat these feelings? I don't know if it's actually depression but whatever it is it's getting to the stage where it feels overwhelming and pretend there's nothing wrong is tiring.","1"

"Please point me to a better sub if this is not the appropriate place for this, or if there is a better sub to discuss  this on.I have had life long trauma and depression and a bi-polar shit life. A lifetime of experimental medications. Several hospitalizations due to inability to control myself in various ways. A lifetime of trying to learn whats up with my head. Im sure its not much different than some of you out there.Last year I was prescribed Wellbutrin after attempting yet another string of drug/counseling experiments to see what works best for me. It was a difference  of night and day.  I sung out loud as my brain settled and life became far more manageable. I did suffer short term side effects as I started. Wellbutrin has a very unique side effect feeling, making it very discernible from other drugs.So ya, a good year has gone by feeling good in the most part. Zero complaints.2 weeks ago, a few basic life situations elevated in stress. Fam. Dating. Work. Health. All low level stressors, and not out of the ordinary for me. But apparently these things spun into some sort of mania I am now suffering. Whatever the reason, Im out there and unable to focus or be around people in a semi normal way.Then something interesting happened and this is the point where my question comes in.Out of the blue, mid way into this manic state, I am now suffering hard side effects from the wellbutrin. Its as if the mania and wellbutrin arent working together. Im suffering full blown side effects in a far more powerful way than I did at the beginning. Pretty much 70% of everything listed in MD. Some of which are dangerous and scary to me and others.I wonder if others are familiar with such an issue or have any tips which can lead me to more research. Is this something which may pass?One major thing with wellbutrin side effects is rage. With this rage, comes paranoia on what reality is. I cant tell if others are pissing me off  or if I am just overly sensitive...a term I have heard many times in life. Now I  am lost as to how I appear to others. Am I loosing it and no one is degrading me? Am I loosing it and others are degrading me and I am being too soft and not protecting myself?I just dont know. Im so confused to what reality is right now. Im guessing this rant makes little sense to others and you will read it with confusion.  I do know one thing...Im doing my best to keep my mouth shut, because I feel I may destroy my life if I reveal my feelings and or concerns. I figure a faceless reddit rant may be best.","1"

"Went to the doctors (GP) today for a bunch of things bad back (scoliosis), bad knee and my depression. Now it is important that you know that sport is the only thing that I enjoy doing, besides gaming,and I haven't been able to do it due to my knee and therefore I am just spiralling further into depression. Now given that I have a 10 minute appointment I thought it was reasonable that I could discuss at least the two most important (they ask for your ailments before you attend) those being my knee and my depression. I get there and they are running late ( as usual) so my appointment time is already going to be cut. We then spend half the time discussing my issues only for her to say ""I can only deal with one"" now baring in mind that, as those who are truly depressed will understand, getting my depression sorted at this point almost seems pointless due to feeling numb and the rest. So I choose the knee, she then proceded to question me about my knee (I had noticed her looking at me oddly as we walked to her room) long story short she accused me of taking to long to answer questions, i was just trying to give accurate details, and seemed to be accusing me of something. To be honest not really sure what my problem was just felt like I was being interrogated, despite her knowing of my depression complaints. That and the fact that I now have to wait another week when I am sitting on a razors edge.TL;DR Doctormade me choose between what injury I wanted looking at and then proceeded to make it seem like I was trying to get something from her I.e. drugs","1"

"Before Reading this I know this is a lot but I would really appricate anyones help right now.Lets say Ive tried writing about this a lot of time but Ive usually failed or I deleted the file because I wasnt happy with it. Im here to tell whoever is listening my story. You can hold your own opinion over this because Ive gotten to the point of life where Id really do anything for a better tomorrow. Ive dug my own holes repeatedly and Ive let people do whatever they would please with me and it tears me apart to not see me happy anymore I cant get a hold of my life and my lifes just become one disaster train.A cold feeling, I receive all the time reminds me of everything, some days when things seem like absolute hell I go into a mode of thinking which brought me here in the first place. I just want to speak about the Sheldon I once had a while ago, probably around half a year ago where everything started to get worse. A lot of it is myself to blame because I was such a nice and caring person like I always have been. This person drove me into the complete shit in my life, feeling completely controlled and no longer belonging in my own body. Most people would straight away think of a girl breaking my heart or something to do with a girl, well fuck I wish it was this right now. I am a complete straight guy, but yeah, I let a fucking gay guy totally running my life and you know whats even better? If I end our friendship well lead to me finally being happy and me ruining a lot of his life probably. Something Im not exactly proud of is he feel in love with me but obviously I didnt because Ive never had any sexual feelings towards him. Lets start where all of this began, 3 years ago we meet each other and become good friends over the course of 1 and half years. Its quite hard for me to think of the good now after all this shit but yeah a while back we were quite good friends This was also mainly due to my school issues at the end the time and he was the person there for me at that time which was great at the time. Back at that time I didnt know he had any sexual feelings towards me, but now I purely see why he did what he did for so long is because of his fucked-up feelings towards me. Around the end of that point he eventually told me he was bisexual, but I didnt see a problem with it because my best friend in Austria has been gay and we still to the day are amazing friends, obviously he had never shown any sexual feelings towards me. But our candidate who caused us all this pain was a little older than our Austrian gay friend Iman. So, for the next half a year, an era I call the 2nd Phase of Terror, which ran between 1.5 to 2 years after meeting him.Phase 2 now when I look at it was okay, I mean occasionally I didnt enjoy the tension or friction we had. It was a phase I probably was the nicest and most interested in him in terms of being friends but also a time where I only realized afterwards the harm I was causing to me and him. This was the time which caused things to get as bad as now Nowadays this time often gets referenced by him to see how things used to be good and how I am changing basically playing emotional warfare with me. I mean I probably really did enjoy this time a lot as he filled the void of me never having a best friend or someone who truly enjoyed spending time. I mean I had no girlfriend at the time and was lonely, so I just had some fun and he taught me growing up in a way.Now lets get to the Third Phase and my current phase of this pile of shit. I can quite clearly identify the start of this era through me Captaining a good team of his. I was a pretty inexperienced player at the time and saw this thrill of power as a huge opportunity. Well one straight problem was him becoming my Owner at that moment and the power he held above me in that case. I had a lot of responsibilitys and I was still a kid at the time, so I made a lot of errors because It was like being thrown into a working environment at a high school age, which demolished my nice person, as I just took everything and blamed myself. I know there was a lot of things he took for me to protect me, but he feared losing me if I leave. I asked plenty of times to step down but there was nobody in my team who could fill my shoes, but I also think he feared losing me as Id become less involved with him. As the year carried I went through a whole 2 months relationship that I hide from him because he hated Indian girls and since I was dating her, he didnt like that I was touching something Indian. This was mostly easy to hide as I could just lie about something and it was still in a time where he didnt control my whole life. Throughout the year he caught me lying and this made him even more paranoid regarding his say in my life. In that year June and July came around exams came around and my marks went into the complete shits. I had just gotten together with my crush/my best friend. She was about the only thing keeping me happy throughout my tough times. The Reason my marks went into the shits in June was mainly due to the anxiety I had built up through this clan, as I constantly got shit on for doing something wrong and this also caused a lot of stress. I would basically go offline and tell people Id study but, I just avoided people. I did try to study more but somehow my brain wasnt with my body no longer. I had at that time lost my happiness and I didnt know to regain it but get rid of this one person causing it in my life. This also marks the point in time when everything started to get worse. I started to get more anxious and stressed about the clan and pressure mounted on me as our team was doing very well. I also had to start investing more time into the Clan and started to get scared of going out else I might be shit on by him even more, as it was probably happening weekly now. His implementation of the bedtime during the week also started to hurt me inside more and more as I felt like I was living the same day repeatedly. I started to feel like a criminal on social media as everything I posted or did would have an impact on him maybe getting angry at me as he had in the past for saying if I can doo that with someone else why not with him. He slowly started implementing things from his life onto me where he had past experiences, like dont drink or go out to club: This came in many regards of my life, I started to feel I need an approval stamp about everything from him now and slowly I had to tell him more and more where I was or what I was doing, as he slowly started to turn into a complete control freak.Now comes a part where things started getting worse in my relationship, with me fearing going out I hardly ever saw Taryn (my girlfriend). I really wanted to as she was the one thing bringing me happiness everyday and putting a smile on my face. This impacted our relationship also as I was hiding obvious problems that I refused to speak about and just told her only later a fraction of the story as it was extremely complicated. I le him now destroy my relationship by letting him take my time and make him control me. I was such a weak-minded person that it was hard for me to get out of it. I started to hate every time he made me see him in real life as he was now longer that friend he used to be to me. I avoided seeing him and made sure to always have an excuse for not being to make it but funny wise often things came about on the weekends he wanted to see me. More days turned into days where I would avoid WhatsApp as much as I could and would mainly try to keep my mind of it by thinking clear or going into a life thinking mode. Many days turned into disasters as I would just be sad the whole day and could no longer see the positivise. After all my marks had been through the gutter and I was becoming more anxious and scared by the day. At times I was struggling to do well in videogames and tennis and I just saw no more good in my life. I felt like I Had no more control over myself and slowly what I used to help me escape reality would turn into my fear of being caught playing the wrong times or not without him, which would cause his wrath of anger. Rage came about, and we played at SAs highest level and did extremely well but still I didnt feel amazing about after all the harm it caused to me over the year. After that point I thought things would get better, but they barely did as he still controlled me and soon exams hit so I basically had no time or will to go out because exams were coming, and my girlfriend was busy, so I only ever did anything with my family. I had slowly started speaking to my brother about this whole thing and one loyal friend which mostly just help me be able to rant my problems to someone without me exploding of frustration. I had also forgotten a crucial event in the 3rd phase being the time I cried at school about all of this before speaking to a school councillor. This happened just before the Justin Bieber Concert after a huge fight of me not telling him about it. After Rage I also told him I had a girlfriend and he was infuriated as I told him Id wait but that was about 4 months of waiting I had done in books even though I had gotten together a while ago because I couldnt wait else I might lose her. At that moment I again lied to him about how long id been together and basically told him a date which he would get less angry with as he is extremely emotional like a child. Lets just say I cant feel who I am anymore I feel like a robot who has to daily report to him because when I dont he phones me a million times or even wants to drive to my house as he knows where I Live. I never wanted thing to get as bad as they did but his guilt driven things he says make me feel bad and the blackmail influences me on a deeper emotional and mental level. Ive been mentally and emotionally damaged hugely and just want my old life back. The Pain should just end now and Im still lost as he fell in love with me but expects the same but in a way of attention and Im basically all he has in life now meaning Ill crush his soul but its the only way to make me happy now after all of this. I also just want my relationship to go back to normal and everything else will fall into place.I just need help right now and I do need to speak to more people about this","1"

Because of my social withdrawal after previous experiences plus looks that only plastic surgery could deal with, Im unable to find anyone.For all these years Ive been feeling like I was carrying a vessel full of feelings I cannot share with anyone. Yep, its cringy af but Im literally full of love I dont know what to do with. I really dont know what I should do and I feel like Im about to burst.","1"

"It'll be a rant, sorry, I need to vent.So, I've been having a therapy for over a month. For now it only makes me depressed, because we're at the point of talking about my past, my personality, summing it up etc., so all that bad and painful stuff is being brought up from its dark place where it was hiding and it hurts as fck.I'm very into that psychological stuff and like to read about it to know more about myself. And I recently discovered that I'm codependent. From my parents. With my dad not helping, who is emotionally immature and has his own problems and uses me as his ""sweet daughter"", who is to make him happy and feel loved, so basically he's making me his parent and gets furious when I refuse and try to be independent.So I decided that this weekend I'm not going to my parents house (as I do every weekend), because being there only makes me depressed and anxious. And now I AM depressed and anxious because of not going to visit them. Because... And that's silly, I really don't know! Because dad will be upset? Because he's become addicted to me? Everytime I visit my parents he runs to me with his arms opened, to hug me and tell how happy he is to see me, literally like a toddler seeing his parent. So then I'm trying to remind myself ""It is OKAY for you to stay home and not visit your parents, they're adults, they'll be fine, you have the right for some time for yourself"". But then I'm anxious again, because I'm showered with guilt, all anxious and sad that I've disappointed my parents, that I have free time and don't spend it with my family etc. IT SUCKS. And I'm seeing my therapist next week, not on Friday as always, GOD HELP ME.","1"
"Copied and pasted from my earlier thread because this is the most i've gone in depth about my life and i'm too fucking lazy to bother re-writing.My whole life has been in misery. Since I was young, Beaten for the crime of being autistic, shamed by my religious parents because they saw my Autism was a curse from god for their sins.I was also beaten a lot. Brooms, things on the table, etc. Whatever they could grab and wherever it landed. I attempted suicide at 17, still debate if it was the right choice that I didn't. I wanted to move away and make something for myself. So I applied for wellfare and moved to the city a couple hours away. I went to college until I had a nervous breakdown. I tried to get a job as a clerk and the same thing. So I signed up on disability. Every day for the past two years was just existing to exist. I found love and was finally happy for the first time in over a decade until they used me for my money and abused me. All because I was too much of a coward to say anything mean to them.Now i've spent the past year. Living. Eating. Occasionally cutting myself. Everything that once mattered is gone. I used to believe that I could beat depression. But even with whatever meds I shove down my throat, it never stops. I have come so far since then for nothing but me. I don't improve my life to seem better for others or to woo people. I did it for me. Because if I didn't, I would be dead. And I see these people trying to make this sickness romantic. My ex wanted a monster to cure. She thought my life was romantic because of how fucked up I am.Seriously, why do people want to pretend there's something romantic about this? Or they think it's cute when I don't let people in my life. Do people actually think I write poetry or i'm some deep intellectual lost soul waiting to find someone to free me?You wanna know what I do? I lock myself in my room and wait to feel starving pain. i think of every bad moment in my life and honestly debate if it's worth it. I question if my death would have made everyone's lives easier. I literally can't make myself get up. I'm losing control of myself. And not one person on this damn earth cares. ","1"

She says that I'm the only one who can make her smile, that makes me feel important, too important. Sometimes I think about letting her go, but I love her.

Oh boy, my body had a panic attack and my blood pressure was huge. 3 days later i still feel that something is not right. My heart beats are very heavy.I can't smoke cigarettes any more, because i suspect they might worsen my situation. Yet that was the only thing that i loved to do.Fuck. I fail so much in life.","1"
"I don't know if this belongs in suicide watch. I don't want to commit suicide, but I think my friend might have just done so. I guess I'll know for sure in a few days, when he doesn't contact me. He was or is severely depressed. I'm not going to talk about all of his issues here, because there are a lot of them. The only relevant information for now is that he is or was suicidal, that I've talked him out of suicide before, and he didn't have a lot of friends. I was one of his only friends, and he is or was also one of mine.Two nights ago we were talking on the phone about our relationships. I told him that I once told my [current] boyfriend that I loved him but that he didn't say that he loved me back. He told me that he was once in a relationship with a girl and the same thing happened, and that it made him lose interest in her, sort of insinuating that that same thing might happen to me. He was trying to give me advice, I guess. I started crying. He didn't exactly know that I would have reacted the way I did, but then again that isn't really the type of thing you say to someone if you're trying to help them with something. I told him that I needed some time alone and hung up.Now, I have a problem with being confident in relationships. Long story short, I've dated some shitty people and people who made me feel insecure, guilty, and generally badly about myself (and I'm sure most of you can understand or have experienced what I'm talking about). Because of that I've felt really insecure about a lot of my relationships, not just the romantic/sexual ones. The guy I'm dating now is a total sweetheart and we've been dating for almost 9 months now, but in the beginning of the relationship I was really scared about losing him because I can get really emotional at times. A month or so ago I finally started to feel more confident about this relationship because it's lasted so long.So, after I hung up on my friend (and went to sleep, because it was night time), he sent me a bunch of messages saying that he was sorry, he didn't mean it, etc. I know that he didn't mean to hurt me, even though he didn't use the best advice. When I woke up, I told him that I would talk to him for a few days because I was angry about what he said, but that he shouldn't be afraid of losing me as a friend. I just needed some time to ""recuperate,"" essentially. Last night he messaged me again, saying that he was 'leaving,"" and that he was sorry. From talking to him before when he was like this I knew that he meant that he was going to kill himself. Then he blocked me and deactivated his account before I could reply.Not too long ago, he activated his account I guess, because he started talking to me again. He said that the way he said goodbye last night wasn't the proper way to go. Then he sent a few long messages that all boiled down to him not wanting to need people anymore when they didn't need him. He said that hurting me was essentially the tipping point. Then he blocked me again, and hasn't talked to me since.If my reaction to what he said was his tipping point, I don't know if I'll ever be able to forgive myself. On the other hand, what he said really did hurt me. It's going to take everything in me to convince myself that it wouldn't be my fault if he killed himself, and even then I don't know if it will be enough. Does this mean that I should be completely selfless and not be offended when people deeply hurt my feelings? I don't even know if this is me being ""offended"" or if it's more me just being scared and hurt. And now I feel awful for making this post about myself, when it should be about my friend possibly just committing suicide. I don't even know what to think anymore.","1"
"(Idk if this is the right sub, if its not please direct me to it.) (also Im writing this while feeling like shit so sorry if it is garbled.) Im a 21 year old male, and to this day my parents continue to physically and verbally abuse me. I attend university and hold a job, and to everyone else I must seem like a normal dude. However, Im not.My dad is mostly just complicit, but my mom degraded me every day, throws shit around the house, and occasionally hits me with wires, belts, or hangers. Shes my mom so obviously I cant physically fight back, so mostly I just attempt to run or cover as much of my body as I can. I usually yell and scream at her in response, but Ive never told her any bad words or told her to shut up. She also constantly tells me every insult and curse word imaginable, and at this point it Just kind of rolls off. Im not the best son, I can be lazy but IBe never done anything that I think has ever warranted this type of behavior. Its been like this my entire life, and I think I just recently Ive noticed the effects on my life. I have severe social anxiety, to the point where I cant talk to a stranger one on one face to face (parties, social events, etc) unless its in a professional setting  or ask my professor questions during office hours. Its been like this for as long as I can remember, and I hate it. I cant even talk to my gfs friends because I feel so judged by them, even if they are just being nice people. I also went from a As and Bs college student to complete trash, and its not that I cant understand the material, I just cant bring myself to work if that makes any sense. I would just sit in my schools computer lab and not type anything for hours upon end. I wouldnt turn in any work but I would still attend class and actively participate and know the material. It got to the point where I wanted to kill my self , because I felt the only thing that my parents wanted (for me to get a college edu) was slipping from me, the only thing that would make my parents happy.The thing is, my mom had a fucked up childhood. Her mom left her to grow up at my great grandmas house until she was 12, and then took her back in when she (great grandma) died. She would constantly degrade her and beat her, and would always have men who were drunk in her home. Her 15 year old brother was addicted to meth, and would constantly have hallucinations and scream in the home. At one point, my grandma shaved her head and forced her to go to school like that. This all happened in Mexico btw. I dont know what to do, as my mom has never failed her motherly duties and has been always caring and taken us to the doctor and everything. I feel guilty being angry at her or feeling bad about myself when all this stuff happened to her. And this is further personified whenever I try to talk to my older sister, as she just says just understand what my mom had to go through. I wanna move out, but I cant move out because of financial insecurity. I also feel guilty because my parents gave me so much when we had so little, idk I just dont know what to do or feel. ","1"
"Im really not good at communicating my feelings but ill try. Ive never been to a specialist but ive been depressed since I was about 15 (currently 22). At least I think its depression, I dont know if its another mental disorder or mood issue. Ive never been to a specialist or any type of therapist, so i really dont know whats wrong with me. Some days will be great and some days im at rock bottom. Lately its been sky highs during the day and extreme lows closer to night time and throughout the night when I cant sleep. Kinda like tonight, I had an amazing day, but as soon as I locked myself up in my room i started feeling the weight of my emotions feel heavy. Last year I was baker acted for attempting suicide, it was around this time last year. I went as far as to cut myself tonight and I havent since then. After I laid in bed and started crying because I felt guilty. Idk if i feel guilty i didnt end it or guilty bc i promised myself i wouldnt do it again..Its hard to explain my emotions because I rarely talk about them, the thoughts are always in my mind but when i try to speak them out loud it doesnt come out right or i cant explain myself. Theyre aligned in my mind but when i try to speak its just a fuckery of words. I feel worthless all the time, i feel like everyone around me is pretending to like me or using me. I just feel unappreciated all of the time. Im always friendly with people and im respectful. I never know if its something im doing wrong or if its just everyone else? I dont feel connected to anyone, i dont feel like i fit in anywhere, i never hear from my friends unless i message them first and sometimes when i do message them i get ignored, when i share my feelings theyre ignored or just dismissed. Im not really sure what the point of this post is anymore, i guess i just wanted to vent and get it all out, i hope someone understands and can give me a few tips on not ending my life. I tried to explain as well as i could but theres way more that i just cant explain because i am so tired","1"
"I'm 18 and have recently decided to self refer myself for therapy. I have struggled with a whole bunch of problems in my life for a good few years. I think from when I was 12 I realised  the extent to which my family was messed up. to start with, I am from a multi faith multi cultural family and if it isn't apparent, this is probably where most of my problems stem from. My dad is an obnoxious, arrogant and self centred control freak who has always felt the need to practically undermine me and dictate everything I do from how I'm meant to think to what I'm meant to wear. Ofcourse at 13 I became rebellious which did not result in a great outcome. due to his insensitive, ignorant and uneducated mindset (my dad hasn't had a proper education. he dropped out of school at 13) I made a bad decision. that year was probably the worst year of my life so much happened that has just destroyed me emotionally. Yet i bottled it all up and tried my best to carry on as if life were normal... its far from normal. my parents honestly hate each other and i have been the bridge between them from the minute my brain could retain memories. there has been many times where i have had to actively wedge myelf between the two of them just to avoid anything horrendous happening. this was when i was growing up so just before I was in secondary school. about the time I was 11. I just don't understand why they always would feel the need to criticise eachother and tell me about it so I'd basically be the one fed the hate from whatever new spat they got into. I know for a fact this messed wih my emotional state because now I have no idea what the hell im meant to dofrom the time i was in secondary school everything  basically just kept going downhill. My mum was gonna leave my dad but ofcourse that hasnt happened. now my dad is saying he's leaving but ofcourse that wont happen either. and as always im stuck between the two. one minute they hate eachother and the nex my mums being nice or my dads being nice and then the next i have my mum bawling her eyes out expressing all her regrets about marrying my dad and ive had to deal with this rollercoater for 18 years. I genuinely cant take it anymore. so that is why i have now started therapy. loads of family issues. no way to express it. i became quite an angry person but the anger is aimed at myself. when i was 15 id iit myself out of anger if i felt i ruined something like an outing with my friends or if i got into an argument with my boyfriend. i tug on my hair when im stressed. i have several panic attacks a week. most times i just can't breathe properly and i cry myself to sleep because i just feel like total trash. my doctor told me that the symptoms are that of mild/chronic depression, though i coulda told her that. on top of the frequent family drama i have several arguments with my boyfriend over what seems so futile to me. i feel like he is still a child but i love him so i have to get through it. i try talk to him about this and he used to be supportive but now i guess hes just sick of hearing it and i dont blame him. im sick of it too. i just feel shit all the time.im quite a sociable person but recently I've lost most of my friends because I did work a very tough job that consumed my free time and i got pissed at one friend and because its a clique thing they all basically choose her over me which is ironic because they all have issues with her and i was the one they always came to complain to. I usually tried to remain impartial.i didnt have much of a social life the past few years because i put my time into revision for exams.i am now a fresher in college and once again another big let down in my life. Everyone has their groups in my course but surprise surprise im the one on the outside looking in. i do have a want to like feel like  i belong and being an island isnt nice for me. i talk to everyone but theres no set friends of mine yet. i still feel like everyones an acquaintance of mine and the first semester is already over. oh yeah and my dad has been ignoring me for the past four months i might as well be dead to him. He is ignoring me for reasons of his own that no one in their right mind could comprehend there is no talking to that man. I apologise if this sounds crazy but i really just felt like this was the right place to post it. I'm hoping therapy will help me fix how broken i am. i dont like feeling so empty. I cry all the time and i hate it. for years ive basically put on a happy face but its really not true. im honestly broken inside. I've no self esteem anymore and quite frankly im just on egg shells all the time with my emotions. im scared of being happy because i dont wanna go back to how i feel the majority of the time. i just feel so hopeless, useless like i shouldnt even bother. that its better to hide in the dark than feel happy because feeling happy just wont last long. Tl/dr: I am 18, a fresher at college and have been struggling emotionally for years now and decided to self refer to therapy because of my dysfunctional family that always uses me as a bridge between the two of them as well as social problems I've recently been experiencing. Because of all this i feel isolated and alone. The emotional problems have left me unable to handle it the best way so i self harm when angry, upset or just feel crappy. because of all this i decided its time i sought professional help because i'm obviously not coping very well.

However, he finds that he is actually in hell after he discovered that getting everything only made everything pointless and dull. Everything I have thought would improve my life and happiness has come true. I always wanted someone to love me, ended up married for several years before getting divorced. Wished I could get a new job and got it now iv been there for 5 years and couldn't be more depressed. Met the most amazing girl at that job that even when I unintentally pushed her away she was always there for me. And when she got a promotion I sank into a deeper depression since I didn't get to see her as often. I began to ignore her since I didn't want to bother her with my problems and she ended up married and recently had a child. I saw her today and thats what breaks my heart, she's still here for me after everything I put her through but I lost the only person who I could connect with and just be happy. I know this is a small list but my life is full of examples. If you made it through that thank you for your time. I hope all of you can eventually live happy lives.

"Depression for me is a cycle. The beginning everything feels okay. But as the cycle continues to progress you're left feeling empty, sad, and broken. I experienced the worst grief that I've ever felt in my young adult life so far. When I was 15 my father passed away. Since then I've gone through bouts of depression. I miss him everyday and I feel like even though its been 5 years, I still wait for him to get home from work or take me on a drive. Sitting in the passenger seat of my father's car as he drove through the most beautiful places in my home state are memories that I will forever cherish. Now I'm in college and it kills me that I can't tell my dad how my day went or how I feel about my classes or about the boy that I really like. Living with depression just seems normal to me. I'm stuck in this negative mindset that recently just occurred in the last few months. I'm beat myself up for every little thing that I do. I care too much about how other view me and I cry in bed feeling so alone and broken. My heart aches with loneliness, I curl up in a ball and cry and pray to God that he'll take my feelings away and become an empty shell. I'd rather be apathetic than feel anything at this point. I've come to realize how unwanted I am amongst my peers, my body aches with the amount of loneliness and sadness I feel on a daily basis. ","1"
"just ranting... I've had depression for most of my life but I feel it has gotten worse since dropping out of school. I've been unemployed for what I feel is way too long, and I'm really struggling finding one where I at least land  a job interview, I feel constantly kicked to the gutter like yesterdays garbage. I can't even land a job as a cleaner, like wtf is this world where you have to have ""a certain set of skills"" to fucking scrub faeces from the toilet...Oh and I have extremely terrible social anxiety that has plagued my whole life which is really tough to cope with.For a while now I've been having what I think are suicidal thoughts, something I have never had before, I even remember saying to my mum when I was younger, when a girl at my school killed herself over bad final exam scores, that I would never kill myself because I love life, but i was so naive back then... Even though I have these thoughts to end it, apart of me is too much of a coward to actually do anything, because I have a wonderful woman in my life that gives me a sign of hope at the end of the day that everything will work out for me in the end... but I'm still fucking waiting.I tried my best for years to find a job, something I have aspired for, for so fucking long, with nothing working out after all this time, I feel as if the universe doesn't want me to succeed... I know it's all in my head but I fucking hate this immense sadness I feel whenever my girl isn't here to remind me the good things to look forward too in this world. I'm sick of the same routine, I want to get out and live life, and brush off this dark entity I call depression following me around wherever I go.... Someone give me a shot to shine... I try to vent all my pain in rap songs, something that calms and relaxes me, but it only lasts for so long before I feel like utter shit again and the damn cycle repeats itself...Thinking about killing myself and leaving everything behind scares the shit out of me, waking up everyday and living life not having a purpose scares the shit out of me.

"Here me out and don't get me wrong--suicide will undoubtedly affect those around me in a big way. My mom would be heartbroken; My friends would cry for weeks, BUT I'm quite certain they'd get over it. And I don't mean that in a harsh or intense self loathing way. Honestly, like most hardships in most people's lived they'd be upset, mourn my loss, and move on, enjoying the memories. I don't think I'd shatter anyone's life so I don't see why that's ever counted as a means to guilt trip a suicidal person into living a miserable life. ""That's such a selfish thing to do to your loved ones.""They'd get to live on and move past that hurt, whereas I'm stuck hurting living a life I don't want just to appease others. Plus, selfish isn't always a bad thing. Here in this community, we can fathom what major or seemingly minor things could push someone to kill themselves.

I was back at work in less than a month from the heart attack.  The problem is, I don't think all of what makes me who I am came back when they restarted my heart.  My emotions are all over the chart and I sometimes have to fight the depression so hard that I'm exhausted.

"I go to a famous high school for gifted students. It requires you to take an entrance exam on the major that you choose. Things have been going well last year, but now when I am in my second year, school just makes me feel so freaking depressed. I couldn't catch up recently in some classes, especially maths and chem. I almost never have to worry about my grades or my academic abilities until now. The lessons are too difficult to understand, the teachers talk too fast and they seem to ignore me when i say that i don't get it. Probably because there are some other students in my class that are so much better than me and they can always answer the questions somehow. I have good marks at the beginning of the terms, but it has been going downhill since then.I did fucking terrible on the chemistry exam today. I studied so hard the night before but i just can't do it. I feel so disappointed in myself when everyone in class was exchanging answers and i cant do that because i cant even figure out anything. I just cried my ass out because i can't stop thinking about my grades. I can't talk about this with anyone, cause i talked to my parents and they just keep on blaming me. I can't talk to my friends either, because all of them are basically good at everything, they took that test and they did great so I don't want to drag them down. Now I want to end my life here. I don't want to deal with any problems in my life anymore. I don't want to deal with my parents' expectations, the pressure they put on me to get into a good university and get a scholarship anymore. It's too overwhelming. I don't want to feel embarrassed when my friends know about my grades. I fucking hate my life. Why am I so pathetic? School is hell to me now.

"Ive never used reddit, so if my speech aint up to snuff then I apologize.

I have two parents and a sister that love me, my schooling (up to now) has been fine, and I never had any real burden and struggle. My parents are fairly wealthy, and Im at a great university.

I try to put blame on society, on the people around me, on my friends and my family, and I feel like this destructive torrent that was started for no reason and is doing damage for no reason. I know that the only thing inhibiting me is me, and the solution is to just get over my sad self pitying mood, but I cant.I overthink everything to the point of accepting that nothing matters. My dream (god I hate saying that) is to be a musician, and in the back of my mind I feel as though its something I can do. But then I just think longer and realize that even if I do reach the levels of fame that I want, Im still going to be this self destructive mess that cant find joy in anything.If youve read up to this point and are struggling to see what the problem is, as you have to work graveyard shifts to feed your starving kids, as you have to fiend coins in a cup to get another gram, as you face your partner and tell them you dont love them anymore, then you are right where Im at.Im too weak to commit suicide, I want to leave my dorm at 3:00 in the morning and smoke cigarettes in my bare feet and punch the sidewalk, but I know that I would just wake up the next day with a cold and broken knuckles. I feel helpless, that no matter what, things will carry on. I see no path. My only plan is to get dragged along until things get bad enough to where suicide looks more viable.Im such a piece of shit.If youve read up to here, thanks for lending an ear.","1"

I am alright at many things but not good at one particular thing. I don't have any defining qualities or traits that make me stand out compared to others.I'm realizing more and more that I'm not different, I'm just a boring human.

"The suicide hotline number seems like the first thing youre directed to when youre suicidal. I have no friends or family to talk to, and I was so desperate I finally decided to call the hotline even though Im terrified of phone calls. I probably called and panicked and ended it before it connected at least 20 times because I was so anxious. When I finally got the courage to stay and it connected, I said I wanted to kill myself and the operator told me I should calm down and call another time. Isnt it her job to help me calm down? How could I call another time if Ill be dead? I was so disappointed I just ended the call. It was probably 3 minutes long at most and I wasnt able to get anything off my chest. I feel even worse. Ive been thinking about this for a very long time and not even the main resource for suicidal people could help me. I dont want to try to call again, it was hard enough to call the first time. Im so hopelessEdit: Thanks for the support. Im sorry to everyone who also had bad experiences but I hope this doesnt discourage anyone who wants to reach out from calling.

"The topic about kpop came up and she proudly said unlike me, she did not like any kpop artist at all. Implying that liking artists/celebrities are a bad thing. She proceeded to say something about our religion. Then I said, its a hobby, so all hobbies are bad then? She said Im her family, so she wants me to go to heaven. I replied, As if youre a God. Then she proceeded to say more things about our religion, something along the lines of, Lives is short. You dont think about death at all. I just replied You have no idea whats going on inside my brain and walked away from her.So I went from not having any depressive episodes at all from the past few days to wanting to kill myself in a second after she said that. Whats made me even more annoyed and disappointed is that she knows I have mental illness, that is social anxiety, and I thought she might have known that I might have depression also because she talks about her friend that has depression. I thought she understands a little bit since she did recommend me to go to a psychiatrist, even though she said it non-chalantly. Then a horrible realization finally hits me: no one understands me. I thought at least my sister understand, even just a little bit. One of these days, I will have the guts to kill myself and when I do, Im gonna leave a suicide note to my sister just so that she can have that on her conscience for the rest of her life.","1"

I am now anxious about going back to work as I'll have to explain to everyone what happened. At A&E I was told to try breathing exercises and see my GP. My GP was actually great. She put me on propranolol and upped my Fluoxetine. But she also noticed some fresh SH wounds. I'm a mess at this point. I don't want to get out of bed and all I do is cry.

I want to ring the doctors so bad, but I cant. Everytime I get the number up on my phone I dont end up ringing, I feel like my doctor is against me, when Ive been in the past I feel like she doesnt really care and just gave me pills to get rid of me.

"Ive had depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts for 8 years straight now, in varying degrees of intensity. If youre in this subreddit, chances are you can relate, and those things alone probably dont warrant much sympathy. But I dont need sympathy. Right now I just need an outlet, since currently I have none. It doesnt matter if anyone actually takes the time to read this, but if you do, just be prepared for a lot of rambling...Im on medication and have gone to therapy for the vast majority of the past eight years. But at the beginning of October, I started a new job with extremely long hours, leaving me no time to see my therapist. The last time Ive even spoken with her was probably mid-september. And since then, its been a slow and steady decline from moderate, normal depression and suicidal thoughts, to absolute fucking torture 24/7. Before I get into the main bulk of the story I need to get out of my system, I should give some background. It has been two and a half years since my last relationship. That means in two and a half years, Ive had no dates, no sex, not even a kiss or a one night stand. Its been endless, soul-destroying loneliness. And to top it off, Im practically a nympho since sex is pretty much the only thing that is guaranteed to make me at least a little happy for a short period of time, so no sex or physical contact in two and a half years is tearing me the fuck apart. I also, unsurprisingly, have extremely low self esteem. I fucking hate myself. I hate how I act, I hate how I look, I hate everything that I ever do or say. Needless to say, this characteristic is not the most helpful when attempting to pick up girls.Okay I dont know what the fuck Im trying to say here. I dont even know if its worth typing all this out. Basically, even though I know I really need to work on myself before I try dating someone again, I desperately crave a relationship with physical and emotional intimacy. Moving on. At work, theres a coworker of mine, lets call her Sarah. Weve basically spent the last two months together, in the same room for hours and hours on end, so weve gotten to know each other extremely well and are very close. I have basically no close friends, so this is kind of huge. On top of that, she is kind of an incredible person. She and I are alike in a scary number of ways, we have the same sense of humor, the same life philosophies, the same kinds of ideas. She is also unbelievably attractive, like, way out of my league. Its a wonder were even friends in the first place. Now after the first two or three weeks of spending solid time with Sarah, I was already kind of falling for her. However, she had a boyfriend of two years, and they were EXTREMELY serious. Like, talking about moving in together, marriage, kids, the whole shebang. Their families were already practically intertwined. Even though I was already crushing on Sarah, this was actually great for me. I had solidified in my mind - she is taken, shes never going to leave this guy, give up on the romantic ideations.And I kind of did. I let go of my romantic feelings and we continued to be very close friends. Then, over thanksgiving, she and her boyfriend broke up. It was a catastrophe. I helped Sarah through it, gave her advice, tried to be the best friend I could for her. And apparently, I was partially the reason for the break up. I had pointed out how much she had been doing for him, and she started to realize that what she was putting in wasnt really worth what she was getting out. Well, as soon as the breakup happened, my feelings started to form again. And much stronger this time. I could truly see us spending a life together, it seems that good. But lets list the reasons why this will never happen, shall we?:&nbsp;1. Shes out of my league. Though she seems to like my personality well enough, I am not nearly attractive enough for her. Her ex was a beefy guy with a beard - Im a scrawny nerd. 2. Her relationship just ended. Even if I wanted to pursue something, she just ended an extremely long term relationship. Not only would it be rude and insensitive to make any moves right now, but it would just be plain stupid. 3. We work together. This gig is scheduled to continue for a minimum of two more years. Dating a coworker is a bad enough idea, and if we got together and broke up, wed have to deal with the extreme discomfort of having to finish this two year project together. 4. The age difference. She is 3 years older than me. While not that big of a deal (hell, my aunt is ten years older than my uncle), I have a suspicion that she kind of perceives me as lesser, or like a little brother type. Its hard to be sure, but I have a feeling that the thought of actually being in a relationship with me has never even crossed her mind. 5. The friend zone. If I go for it, and she says no (as she VERY likely will), chances are that this great friendship that Ive built with her will wither and die. Neither of us wants that, and she may even use that as a reason why we should date in the first place - to save the friendship. 6. She deserves WAY better than me. Sarah is an incredible person. I am a clusterfuck of a human being, with major mental health issues (clearly) and Crohns disease on top of it all. She deserves someone way, way better than me. And better than her ex too, since he wasnt really up to par either. &nbsp;So, I have no idea what to fucking do. The obvious answer would be, dont try anything. But I cant stop thinking about her. We have such a strong connection, unlike nearly any other friendship Ive had. And now that there is technically hope and she is officially single, its driving me fucking insane. I know she would probably turn me down for a multitude of reasons, some of which I just listed, but I feel like I have to know. If circumstances were different - if we werent coworkers, if there wasnt as much to lose - would she give me a chance? Or would it be a no in any situation? The uncertainty is making me insane. Im pretty sure I have BPD, though Im technically undiagnosed. But this all feels like a classic ultra-attachment to someone, and everything Im feeling is amplified by 1000. I desperately want to cry, and yet I cant even do that. So maybe, if this is all BPD, this isnt even real. But everything Im feeling from this situation - the anxiety, the depression, the uncertainty, the self loathing - it is all just too much, and I have pretty much nonstop wanted to kill myself for the past several days. Suicidal thoughts were already pretty common in my normal depression, but this is much worse than normal. Ive definitely had episodes like this before, but god damn it sucks. I can hardly function at work. Shes been asking whats wrong, and Im just being vague and saying theres some shit going on in my personal life. I just need to die. Side note: this isnt an emergency post. Though my suicidal thoughts are extreme, I will never take action again. I did once, and after seeing what it did to my parents, I cannot in good conscience do anything like that again. But on the other hand, if I died from some health issue or accident out of my control, Id welcome it with open fucking arms. Shit like this for the past eight years has been fucking exhausting. Im just so done. On top of it all, all of this stress and anxiety is giving me a gnarly Crohns flare-up, so I get to feel extra shitty just for fun. I have to play that off at work too. Anyway, I dont know what Im doing here at all. Thats the gist of it. I feel like shit and I dont know what to do. And to clarify, I have been doing everything in my power these past eight years to get better, especially recently. Im constantly trying to alter my destructive and deluded thought patterns, and Im really working on liking myself and bettering my health. Ive tried so many things (and continue to), but even with all of the effort, I still feel hopeless. I really dont think I can get better. I am way too fucked up, and I have tried way too many things to no avail. Honestly once my parents both pass (which, for their sake I hope is not anytime soon), I will finally be able to just die in peace. I constantly yearn for that day. I also have no idea how Ive even functioned still with this severe level of depression and anxiety. I think Im really just keeping going in that regard for my parents as well - make them think Im doing just fine so they dont freak out even more and can live happily. Im also of the mindset that well, if Im stuck here, I might as well make an effort to succeed at things and attempt to make life a little less miserable in the meantime.Alright, Im rambling here. Like I said I would. If any of you actually read all that....may I ask why? Im sorry to have wasted your time. And best of luck to everyone else out there dealing with similar things. I know it sucks, and I wish every single one of you the best. Hang in there, and Ill try to do the same myself. TL;DR - Feel like shit, want to die, blah blah blah. ","1"
"I realize that this is speaking from the mind of somebody who is ""mentally ill"", but it baffles me how any sane person can honestly look around and think ""hey, life is awesome!!""   What's so awesome about toiling away the best years of your life going to school, before finally ""growing up"" into adulthood so you can attach yourself to a career and toil away to make some millionaire even richer, while you get poorer, for the rest of your life?How can anybody spend more than a few hours with other people and honestly say ""I trust people. People are good!""     I just don't see it, nor do i trust other people. Furthermore, how can people have the energy to go through the motions of mundane life while tending to the inane chatter from others...without getting absolutely exhausted and fed up?

"Hey Reddit,I'm not exactly in the best place. I lack perspective in my life right now on a level even I haven't experienced so far.You know, as for many in this sub, my life never exactly felt easy. I write 'felt' on purpose here. I'm aware that the problem here is by myself. You know, I never exactly knew what to do with my life, I'm a good example for this gen-Y-nihilism. I have no perspective, no clue how to move on. I was bullied half my life and wasn't in the best situation afterwards as well. I recently finished my country's equivalent to high school. Afterwards, I wanted to fullfill myself a dream and travel Australia for a year. I saved some money and bought a plane ticket. I went to Australia and failed, I did dump things and didn't get jobs was fired from one which was my last chance before I had to fly home, ... So in the end I had to fly back home and now I'm here, have no job, no money to at least do stuff with my friends (who obviously made fun of me failing in Australia, some of them have been there as well, so I feel like shit).I don't know what I should study at college now, or, rather which Job I want to do afterward so I will probably just study something that seems interesting but will end up in a stupid job afterward after all. And even if I do go to college I have to wait for winter term 2018. So right now, I'm all alone with my misery. I know the best solution would be to find a job but I just... I don't know.  It feels like I'm just not capable of achieving anything right now. I'm just laying in bed all day, my hobbies, for which I would have more than enough time right now aren't fun anymore... I feel like a failure. I start feeling broken, even.To be honest, I felt similar during middle and high school, but at that time I was like 'Welp, this sucks, but once I'm done with school I'll go backpacking and my life will get better and I'll have time to sort things out.

"Hey. Im in pretty hopeless depression since mid-2016.Is there anyone who i could talk with here? I don't even need to talk about my problems. Just talking to someone.","1"
"Hey, folks.So... I typically don't like to brag, but it's relevant here.  I've been pretty lucky all throughout my life.  My family situation is solid, I'm healthy (physically), and I've been lucky enough to be blessed with a number of talents.  In general I'm used to being able to pick things up quickly, whether it's a new concept in school, a new recreational activity, or a new topic I'd like to learn more about.  As you might imagine, I therefore tend to shy away from things that I don't understand, and for the most part that's okay.Now for the depression bit.  I'm unofficially (meaning, everything short of a doctor's signature on the paper) diagnosed with Aspergers' (I know it's not officially a thing anymore, but you know what I mean), but other than that, I've never paid much attention to my mental health, because much like my physical health, I didn't have any reason to worry and therefore I assumed that, for the most part, I was doing just fine.  Even if something came up that I didn't really understand, I would ignore it if it didn't seem like a big enough deal.Unfortunately, some things have come up recently that have been steadily worrying me, and I've been noticing some signs that I know are often related to depression.  But, depression is new territory for me (and as mentioned before, I tend to shy away from these sorts of things). So, once again, I ignored it for the most part, and chalked those feelings up to stress and lack of motivation due to college applications.That all changed when I played through the game Doki Doki Literature Club.For those of you that haven't played the game, it's a visual novel that is, for the most part, a dating simulator.  However, it touches on some of the darker aspects of the psyche as well, including a segment where one character struggles with depression and the player character has to decide how they want to handle it.  I, being the research machine that I am, was googling things about the game and happened to come across some discussions about the depression sections and how people thought they were for the most part realistic (albeit maybe a little exaggerated for gameplay effect).But, naturally, I paid it no mind.Today (not two hours ago, in fact), some things happened that caused everything to essentially come crashing down on me.  The event itself was relatively minor, in fact if I mention it you'll probably laugh, but in short what happened is I lost my crutch.  There was a certain thing that I had been spending more and more time on as my symptoms got worse and worse.  I just figured that I was getting more and more into that activity, but in truth, I was retreating further and further away from my problems.Now that this crutch is gone, I'm forced to face the monster inside of me, and I really don't know what to do.  Suddenly that one sequence from DDLC is hitting home in all the wrong ways, and I'm scared and panicking because I don't know how to even begin handling all this.So this brings me to my request for help.  I need help learning how to manage this, how to recognize the symptoms sooner, how to mitigate the effects it has had and likely will continue to have on my life and my mental well-being, really anything.  Aside from some cursory research on symptoms and the stuff they tell you at school in those yearly counselor introductions, I know absolutely nothing about depression, and as one might expect from reading what I've said, that scares me.Any and all help is appreciated, even if it's just helping me talk through some of the stuff I'm feeling right now.Thanks for reading.","1"

"There are these days when you really can't get out of bed. Then days when you just feel so alone, like how a thought pops in your head like ""Oh do you believe that the fire in the news was stage"" then remember that, oh you don't have anyone to share your thoughts with. Or just those days when you feel so alone and you try to open up but instead of letting you, people focus more on defending themselves and insisting that ""No we're always here for you and we're not leaving you  "" but you never feel it. Some days you're just tired of seeing the worst in everything. Im tired of being mad at all the unseen messages and unreciprocated efforts. Some days you're just mad that ""how come I get to be there for you but I really need someone right now but where are you"" Those days that you just get so tired of being left behind, but there's the guilt creeping in that ""I think I'm the toxic one.

"I shouldn't be in the position I am right now. College finals are around the corner, and I'm probably gonna have to drop out. I shouldn't have to. I've been given almost every opportunity imaginable to not be a complete fuck up. I was given a tuition free ride to the University of my dreams. I have someone nice enough to sponsor me so I could live on campus. And my parents offered to buy my books. It is literally the situation that most college students dream about. Yet somehow I still fucked everything up. All I needed to do was keep a B average, with no grades below a C. I still fucked it up. My future was literally handed to me on a silver fucking platter, and I still managed to fuck it up. I don't know how I'm supposed to live with myself. I don't know how the people who supported me can live with me. I wish I could kill myself, but I know if I did, there would be others who would as well.

I'm not good at any classes and I'm fucking talentless. What's there even to do. Everyday is the same and the only change is it only gets worse every day. I'm running out of ways to cope cuz theater is making me feel even worse about myself somehow. I refuse to tell my parents to get medication or therapy because I don't want to know how they'll react.

"I am a male student in my 20's.I'm sorry in advance if this breaks any rules, I read them and I don't think it does. I just want advice on how to talk to the doctor and what to say.I'm going to the doctor because I just feel like I need to now, I've been having trouble for a while now since I was 19. My parents had split up and I thought I was too mature to be upset about it so I tried not to let myself and that's been a habit of mine ever since tbh. By trouble I mean a few things, I get very anxious over some very basic things, my social life suffers for it and so does my love life. I find it very difficult to trust anyone so I rarely allow myself to open up to anyone or be close to them. I can never lay down to sleep, I just stay up in bed reading Reddit threads (so much that if I look during the day it's boring because I saw it all last night/early that morning) and feeling down about everything. If I'm not reading a thread I'm just thinking about my life and feeling crappy about it.A few days ago would've been the 5th anniversary of me and my ex had we not broken up, I don't miss her as that relationship became kinda toxic. But I miss the way I felt 5 years ago, I wasn't worried about anything, I was just happy. So I decided that I need to see a doctor or talk to someone about how I feel about life now. How do I talk to a doctor about this? I've never been to them for this because of anxiety and I don't like to self diagnose because I see posts on Tumblr from people who do it for attention and it just seems disrespectful. Because of that I've never talked to a doctor about it because I felt other people had it worse, but recently my social life has just died, my motivation is gone, I can't find entertainment or excitement in anything anymore and just feel down by default. It's hard to describe but it just feels worse than it has before and I want it to stop. I have a good life but just feel like my happiness is outweighed by my sadness, loneliness, anxiety and emptyness.Sorry this is longer than I intended it to be, what I wanted to ask is how do I talk to the doctor tomorrow, I can't imagine just sitting down and saying I have depression and getting some magic pill for it. This is making me so anxious and I just don't know how to talk about it. So what do I say? Any advice from people who had similar feelings about getting help would be appreciated. Thank you for reading and sorry it was so long.","1"

"I am a teenager in highschool and I started feeling depressed about 5 years ago. I was always ridiculed, singled out and was never accepted into friend circles. I always felt so alone until about the second half of eighth grade when I started hanging out with people who I actually felt comfortable around.            It wasn't until about 5-6 months ago when I fell for a girl. I loved everything about her. She had an amazing personality, a great sense of humor, and her smile would make me happier than I ever could have imagined. I always told myself to never ask her out, I thought that if I did I would creep her out or she would never talk to me again.            One night I felt that the pain was too much to bear. I started writing some random shit onto a piece of paper. ( just a letter from me to me talking about how I felt) In a sudden turn of events I pulled courage out of my ass and signed the paper with my name and number with a message along the lines of just text me a yes or no. The next day I gave it to her.           I gave it to her in the morning and asked her to read it after school that day. That day was the longest fucking day of my life. I had a band festival at UNLV on the same day and I left the concert at around 7:30. When I left I had not received a text from her. I was so anxious I lashed out at my mom, who made me walk home after getting quite a few miles from UNLV. I had just sat on the side of Craig Rd. For about 2 hours stewing in self hatred.            Just when I lost all hope and started plotting my own demise, I get a notification. It was a long text that said something along the lines of ""hey it's XXXXXX, Sorry I took so long to respond I had to think for a while. I really liked your letter. I feel like the answer is more complicated than a yes or no..."" I wiped the tears off of my face and cried some more when I read that text. We spent the rest of the night texting each other. It was the 2nd best night of my life.           About 3 months ago she formally asked me if we wanted to start a relationship. I of course said yes. We we're together for about a month, until she told me that she didn't feel the same way I watched my heart break as I stood there smiling. (what I typically do when I feel depressed) It was very big news to me and I kept to myself for a while.            Even though that was a long time ago I still remember that as if it were yesterday. Today more than ever, do I feel affected by what happened then. I have asked my parents for counseling more than once but they pretend like I never said anything, and they continue to assume that I am ok. I'm not okay, and I haven't been okay in 5 years. I guess I hide it too well for anyone to notice.","1"

"Long story short, I've got deformations to the intestine that are made worse by IBS and an anxiety disorder. I'm legally disabled and I've been surviving on SSI and food stamps for a little over a year.After some surgeries and heavy medication, I got a little cocky and felt like I could probably go back to work. So, I found a part time job to start out, thinking the load would be pretty light.It turns out I work less days each week, but I still work eight hour shifts. I used to work 12 hour days, so I thought ""how bad could it be?""The worst. On hour 4, I started getting weak. Hour 5, I started shaking and sweating. Hour 6, splitting headache, nausea. And then by hour 7 the nausea was so bad that I threw up during the last 30 minutes of my first day. Then the last 30 minutes were spent slumped over a table, profusely sweating and trying not to vomit. Some of the worst pain I've ever felt in my life, all together.Now I'm stuck. I don't know if I should go back to being the worthless leech on society that I was, torture myself by working like this (and just end up getting fired because it isn't working), or ask for shorter shifts on more days (which it doesn't seem like they even do). Either way, I'm still screwed because this killed my confidence about going back to work and leading a semi-normal life.Day one and I'm already defeated. Now I have to go back in the morning and I only got done throwing up an hour ago. Still weak and shaking too.God dammit.","1"

"I used to be fairly normal, maybe a little on the edgy side but normal. I had a decently sized friend group and I enjoyed joking around and talking to all of them and even though I sometimes felt sad it was bearable. There was someone very special to me in my friend group, her name was Valentine and she was special to and it was a mutual feeling, it's like we were made for each other. We were best friends and she talked about our future and how great it would be. One day I made the decision to homeschool, i started being a dick for no reason and burned bridges and broke promises I made to her but I thought I was hilarious and my ego was super inflated. As the year went on my mental state and grades suffered greatly, I felt lonely and sad most of the time and lost motivation to do anything. This is my second year of homeschooling and I've never felt more broken, I'm going to try to move in with my dad and have a clean slate. I'm just extremely worried about my social skills and if I'll ever meet someone like Valentine again. The worst part about all of it is that it's all my fault and I deserve everything that's happened to me. The guilt I experience and the loneliness and absolute self hatred for everything I threw away overtakes me every single day. Some days I go into anger tantrums when no one is home and just scream and other nights is a soft cowardly cry, it's honestly pathetic but idk what else to do.

"I've been struggling with depression for around 9 years and in the last 3 years it has gotten significantly worse. I've been having suicidal thoughts lately and I am finding it hard to find motivation for anything, and with myself currently in my second year of university it is affecting my studies. I have some friends but I feel like some of them are only there to use me as a tool. (Bumming drives off of me, use my stuff, etc.) I have finals coming up and I don't have the energy to study for them. Hell, I didn't even go to most of the classes either. I feel like a fucking idiot knowing that I'm wasting not only money but my opportunity to graduate and get a job after university. Best part is I'm not even sure if what I'm taking is what I want to do. I only took it because I needed to either go to school and get a degree or find a job. I didn't know what I wanted to do. I didn't tell anyone about how I've been feeling until this year because I felt like it was a taboo topic to talk about. The first person I told was one of my friends when opened up to me about his depression and I felt like there was somebody I could actually talk to about it without sounding like I'm crazy. The second was my mother. I didn't think that I would ever tell her that as I didn't think that she would be very accepting of it. Surprisingly, she was accepting of it and has booked me a doctors appointment. Although she really doesn't fully understand what I'm going through, she does realize that it's serious and is trying to help, and I am very thankful that she is. Hopefully I can get some form of treatment and be able to function properly. Even if I'm having these suicidal thoughts, I don't really feel like I should end my life. I'm hoping there's something more to my life then feeling like this everyday. My sleeping schedule lately has been very off what it normally is, and as I'm struggling through the night I thought making this post would make myself feel a little better as I don't have anyone to talk to. If anyone read this then thanks for reading and sorry it was so long. I just felt like typing out the first things that popped into my head.","1"

"Lately I've been thinking about the feelings attached to terms like Happiness and Joy. I tried thinking of when the last time I was happy and I nearly threw up, and while I'm not going to sit here and pretend its not because I'm not used to being happy. Because that's exactly what it is, to me (and I'm sure many of you) those feelings are foreign like a stomach virus is to the body and its true you can train yourself through shutting down negative thoughts and replacing them with positive ones its not something I really want to do.For the record I don't define myself as being depressed. I am a depressed person but its not something I would put on a sheet if I were a character in a tabletop game. I guess what I'm getting at here is that I don't want to be an emotion, even a good one. It's better if I just think of myself as me and deal with the pain as it comes, I'm still sad sack of shit but at least I'm not just a sad sack of shit like everyone thinks I am.Just some thoughts I wanted to get out in the open take it how you will.","1"

"TW: suicide, rape, depression, hurt .....I've felt like shit for the last two weeks and just today in trying to vent about shit These are really out of order sorry about that (but I'll sort them by kid - teenager adult)  (I'm 19 now) Kid When i was a kid I hung out with this older kid (he was in 5th grade) one time he came over unexpectedly and we were alone and he started saying weird things like ""wanna touch my penis"" and ""if you tell anyone I'm here I'll leave"" and I got scared he didn't wanna be my friend anymore so I did.. I saw my dad have a heart attack, I was just a little kid and my dad came in so I went to see him but he was all sweaty and stumbling around and then he fell forward on to his bed (he survived thank God) Home life in general has always been bad (my parents don't love each other, I'm not going to make myself feel better by telling myself they do anymore because it's obvious they don't) they constantly fight and neither of them have jobs so we usually don't have that much food (I have a job now so it's not as bad) One time my sister and I were walking home from school and got hit by a car. I pushed her out of the way (thank God) and ended up with a broken wrist and broken ankle) Pre teen I was bullied a lot in school for my fashion sense, having taped up glasses, etc. I really didn't have any friends either. So I started lashing out online and I said some fucking terrible things, shit I can't believe I said to this day And from there things escalated into real life, I had knives pulled on me, attacked at a talent show, the principal straight up said to me ""they're just getting back at you for what you said"" and the school resource officer said if things continued they'd give me a criminal record (this all happened over ages 12-13-14) Then at the end of the year I got taken away from my parents and put into a foster home (they separated me from my siblings so I was just alone) I ended up in a group where everyone was considerably older (not adults but older than I was) and there was a lot of sexual tension between people there which stressed me out and made me feel inferior. Not to mention that we only got maybe an hour outside (when the supervision decided it was ok, so not even everyday) and all our downtime was spent in a small lounge watching TVI finally got out of there after 8 months and into a foster home. It started out great!! They let me use their laptop and everything. But then they let a relative take off with the laptop (oh well what can you do). I just played outside that was ok. But my foster mom made fun of me for my incontinence issues (even fucking pulled my pants down once and asked ""did you shit yourself?"") Also I flap my hands a lot for stimulation and she'd get angry at me for doing that. TeenagerI got out of the foster home and things just kinda got stagnant up until high school, that's when I started to feel depressed and shitty all the time -i finnally ended up in inpatient and I thought everything was going to be ok when I got home. Lol nope. I'd either get sent home everyday or I'd just stay home. They wanted to put me back in inpatient but I said no because my parents got mad whenever they got a call from the school saying I had to go to the trauma centerI eventually dropped out (it was a Voc-Tech school) and got put into another school (I dropped out for good after being here for a year and getting into fights a lot) I started doing drugs. Started with pot but then I found out certain anxiety and pain meds can get you high. I felt awesome all the time and even found a girl!! Everything seemed ok. Not ideal but ok. Eventually things with the girl got fucked up and culminated in us meeting (her mom didn't like me and it was obvious). It didn't go good at all. Whatever. (I honestly had no idea what to do and I didn't want to have sex) After the sleep over, things just went off the rails, and since in a fucked up way I viewed her as a ""Ray of light"" in my life I took a shit ton of Xanax and ended up in the hospital. First thing I did when I woke up was message her and tell her what happened... And she started telling me that it's all my fault, suicide is cowardly, etc. I had a meltdown in the hospital but calmed down eventually and went to inpatient again (spent Christmas there) Once I got home I messaged her (lol massive fucking mistake) and told her I missed her and thought about her etc. Her response? ""My friend bought me a vibrator for Christmas"" and then showed me pics. I can't even explain how hurt I felt. In retrospect I should have seen it coming (also my mindset was ""BUT YOU'RE WITH ME"", entitlement etc. Regret it) but it fucked me up. I spent the next few weeks agonizing over this, culminating in me pouring my heart out to her one night. She screen capped my messages and sent them to her friends then showed me their reactions. They said shit like ""he's so pathetic"" etc. At this point I was hurt enough already this barely phased me. Then one night she was really high and called me and asked if I wanted to see her masturbating... I said no but she still sent me a video of her using her using her vibrator with the friend that bought it for her over Skype. That... Broke me, I don't trust anyone sexually anymore, sex is one of my biggest insecurities. But for some fucking reason I still talked to her after that, I'd say stuff like ""I wanna get plugs and dye my hair black"" and she'd be like ""no that'd look ugly on you lol"", like ok. Fine. I eventually got rid of her. So I made a new friend. He was cool. We smoked weed together n shit. Eventually he started showing interest in me, and I was interested in him.  One night things kinda escalated, we were smoking pot in my room and he kept saying ""hey Chris come here"" so eventually I did. We kissed. Ok. I was ok with it. Maybe I wasn't idfk I was high as shit. It escalated to him jerking me off (I didn't want to but I didn't want him to be mad either) and then I did the same thing to him. I kinda just didn't think about that (and really haven't until I told my counselor recently) and whateverBack to more on that girl  Flash forward up to about two months ago (the entire first part with her happened back in 2015) I messaged her to check up, I figured it would be ok, it'd been a long time after all So we talked. She was acting sexual and saying  really sexual things and said she wanted to see me but to bring cigarette money. I did. I walked like 4 miles and we met up. She took the cigarette money and walked away. I was like ok. So I walked home and attempted suicide again (no one knows about this hehe) but would you look at that I woke up in the morning. Ok. Things have just been shit ever since then, I'm having trouble trusting people, my sexual insecurities are always bubbling just below my surface, and I don't have any friends around here.

"I have been diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder. The latest diagnosis is with Psychotic features.I have been on something like 7 different medications and all of them have had big side effects and/or been ineffectual to dealing with my issues.I have hope every time that THIS will be the one that helps me.I have lost nearly all hope, as this takes heaps of time and I am really, really behind in life (broke, without a career, wife or house at 32) and don't want to keep dealing with this.","1"
"I fucked up..again..and this time for real.For most of the time I went to school I always had to force myself.Eventually when I couldnt handle it anymore I had dropped out and actually didnt do anything worth mentioning in that time.After a bad breakup earlier this year I decided I couldnt keep living like this and that I had to make a change,(after the usual I hate myself thoughts subsided and I actually found some motivation), and enrolled in a class to get my degree so I could start living my life...But guess what? After the first day of school and everyone actually being nice, I just couldnt bring myself to go there anymore..its just like something telling me over and over to not go there..I always went to the doctor and got sick leave but last week the school called and told me I missed too much of the year and that I couldnt finish it like that.So here I am, lost another chance to get a better life because Im such an idiot..Its always the same and I feel like it will never change.I dont know what to do and even though my boyfriend is there for me I still feel like it would be better if it wasnt the case so I could just end it in peace..","1"
"They said, ""You're not depressed."" ""Stop talking nonsense.""And they saw my cuts a few months ago.They said I can't be depressed because I never experienced to become financially unstable, because I have a nice home and I get to eat anything.I feel so invalidated, like there's a requirement to be depressed.Just because I don't suffer as much as what they suffered financially before doesn't make me have no right to be depressed.

When will people acknowledge that depression is an illness not a temporary state of mind?The boundary of feeling sad and being depressed is not that big, but there's still a significant amount of difference. The biggest being, that the illness is not natural and most of the time won't heal with time. Unlike the problems stated. /rant over","1"
"I used to be more emotional, but these days all I think about is whether fighting for my life is even worth it.There's no fear or hesitation. It feels like I have uncureable disease in my body that never goes away. Pain in my stomach sweating from stress and constant vertigo. People BS me about how I always have hopes in the future, but that's as unrealistic as stating god exists and cares about each one of us. Noone ever saw god before, there's no proof that god ever helped us. I'm just tired. Tired of living.

"I catch myself sometimes on the subway, at work etc.. Just looking at someone and not liking them. On edge, in my head telling myself ""let them say something to me"". My heart starts racing. And all I can do is zone out completely. Thinking about hurting them. Sometimes it's not that bad, but there's times (like yesterday) I vividly thought about choking some random woman and bashing her head. What bothers me the most is although my body was obviously under stress (the heart racing), whilst thinking about this I get a rush of endorphins. I literally have to snap myself out of it. I would never NEVER EVER hurt someone, but daydreaming about it releases soo much energy.","1"
"I recently moved 30 miles away from my community college. No job, applied but no calls back. I'm using the rest of my savings on gas to attend a 45 minute lecture. Professor hates when I don't show up everyday, takes away my extra-credit & test-correction opportunities. I know she doesn't like me.Grades are dropping.I have no friends, no companion, no support system.Lots of chores. No one in this damn house helps. I have to cook, clean, unpack, bring all the furniture upstairs, etc. Has to be done before anyone gets home from work.Get reminded everyday of the car accident I was in two years ago. Brother complains of the high insurance. I'm in the process of being sued for that. None of my old friends check up on me, not even my dad. The last time I saw him was on my 18th birthday to cancel child support. Two birthdays later and I still haven't heard from him. He talks to my brother, though. The only thing that upsets me the most is my education. I always loved school and I used to get good grades, but I don't have that passion anymore. I feel like my life problems won't allow me to focus on my studies. My life sucks.","1"
"Im writing this because I have nowhere else to go and no one else to talk to. I dont want to bother anyone and I dont want to sound like Im aimlessly complaining, but Im stuck with no clear way to get free. Ive been trying to find an apartment in another city for work and have been met with failure after failure, either because someone else takes the apartment before I can submit an application or because the person offering to let me see it just doesnt care enough to show up at the appointed time. Ive spent months trying to find something, anything, and each time it culminates in nothing but disappointment. Im trying my hardest, pushing myself to the absolute limits of my knowledge and ability and still it isnt enough. No matter what I do, it just isnt enough.To make matters worse, Im being barraged from all sides by criticism. My employers are bugging me to hurry up and move so I can get to work. My online job is pestering me to get all this straightened out so I can get back to work for them as well. And throughout it all is my family, saying there is no one to blame for this mess but myself. I cannot work any harder, but Im being treated like all Im doing is slacking off and treating my life like a joke. Every day Im the butt of some new mockery or the subject of some new shouting match. Every day, my family comes home and Im disappointed to see them again because all I can do is wonder what Im going to be in trouble for today.This in particular hurts because I have lived for a long time with pretty severe depression. It is resistant to both therapy and medication. I was also diagnosed with mild PTSD due to events I endured earlier in life, which makes it difficult for me to ""come out of my shell"" around other people. Ive made my peace with this and have informed my family of my situation. They dont care.They care when its other peoples mental health at stake. Just the other day, I had to sit at dinner and listen to my mother talk about her friend who has ADHD. She was nothing but sympathy and compassion, saying that her friends family should treat him gently because of the severity of his illness. But when her own son has issues, it's just because he is lazy and refuses to listen to other people. The hypocrisy alone is enough to send a person into a rage.Normally I would look outside my family for aid. Unfortunately, that wont work. Ive never had many friends and the few I managed to make over the course of my college life all graduated, moved back to their own lives halfway across the country, and subsequently forgot about me. I am painfully alone and no one is coming to help me from this situation.This is my life now. I havent had a good nights rest in months. Every night, I worry or cry myself to sleep. I can barely eat because feel sick to my stomach almost all the time. When no one is at home, I punch the walls or doors trying to alleviate some of this stress, again and again until my knuckles bleed. It doesnt work and no one cares. Im afraid Im reaching the end of my tether. Im afraid for myself because every day Im left alone in a house with easy access to a loaded gun. And every bad day that passes, that gun starts to look more and more inviting.I know that finding an apartment and a life of my own is my only path forward. But when Im shot down again and again and left with nothing but the rage, abuse, and condescension of quite literally everyone around me, it feels like Im stuck in some self-destructive cage with no way out. And if I cant find a way out, I feel like my only option is to remove myself from the equation.I need help.","1"

"i have struggled with clinical depression and chronic anxiety since i was eleven years old. i am a little over sixteen now, i have been very depressed since the third of november when my boyfriend broke up with me because he didnt love me anymore (he said if came and went and he couldnt keep lying to me anymore, but it had only been going on for a few weeks apparently?). it is now the 29th and he wont even look at me despite seeing him at school multiple times a day and having a study hall together on wednesdays. he doesnt know why it happened. we had never had a fight, he didnt find anyone else, and he said it was nothing i had done. it was so abrupt and nobody saw it coming and now i dont know what to do with myself. three days prior he has woken me up with a good morning text telling me i was the love of his life. i just dont want to find anyone else. and i dont want him to find anyone else. i had a 1.6 GPA my sophomore year and he helped me turn my life around and last week i got an 101% on my geometry test and have a B+ average. i finally felt like i was a functioning person. and now all of that has been ripped away. (and please no generic stuff about how high school relationships never last. we had been official for almost 8 months but had been a couple for over a year now and we had talked about our future extensively and i started making college plans around him.)i had posted about wanting the hurt to go away quite a lot last night on my private instagram only a few friends follow. two of them told the main office and i was kind-of-forcibly escorted out of the school because of my suicidal thoughts and they told me if i didnt leave with my mother they would call an ambulance and have police take me out of the school and to the childrens hospital, and then to whichever mental hospital they best felt suit me. the problem was, i didnt want to kill myself. sure i might have said i wanted to or was going to. but that really wasnt it at all. i have been on zoloft since september but im still struggling with depression, anxiety, and according to my therapist most likely OCD as well. they told me i didnt need to be placed in inpatient care (despite hurting myself), and i was only passively suicidal as i had never really formed a plan to kill myself. i had just thought about what it would be like to be dead. so alluding to all that i just mentioned. does anyone have any help with dealing with passive suicidal thoughts. i dont want to kill myself, i just feel like it would be okay if i went to sleep and never woke up again, or i have thoughts of just getting in my car, filling it with gas, and just driving and driving and driving until theres no more road left. i just feel like things would be better if i could just escape. like maybe i would hurt less. i dont know where im going with this. im just hoping theres absolutely anyone who reads this.

"I'm 19 and I still can't drive. Got the permit and practiced but failed twice and lost the motivation, or rather I channelled what limited motivation I had into more basic tasks like waking up every day.Never had any sort of job. Terrified of applying and interviewing.Horrible social anxiety that only gets better when my depression gets bad enough to numb it. I was out to eat recently with my family and the stress of ordering my food crushed my mood and my appetite. Like, Jesus fucking Christ, ordering a goddamn burrito?? Broke down and talked to my parent once, and got taken to see a doctor. Got a Zoloft prescription and saw an unhelpful therapist a few times before quitting. The stress of doctors got to me and I lied my way through it and said the pills were working fine. I never felt any different. Eventually saw a different doctor and got switched to Lexapro, but I did the same thing as before. The multiple check-ins drained me and I just wanted to suffer alone. As a young kid in school I was always told I was smart, one of the brightest, I could go far with my brain. But I'm so lazy, and tired. I nearly flunked senior year in highschool, I'm failing my first semester of college because I'm a laxy piece of shit who doesn't do their work, and definitely losing the scholarship that got me there.

"My family is abusive. I usually hate the holidays because I become jealous of those with families that love them and sometimes I feel like, with all of the decorations and hype, that their happy status is ""shoved in my face."" I really only feel this way, however, when I feel like I'm alone. It's really easy to feel this way.This holiday season, know you're not alone, and this whole subreddit and my post is proof of that. Sometimes it's difficult to not feel alone, because not only am I depressed, but I'm depressed because I'm being abused. (although I'm not the only one, I just see more adults who are away from their abusive family - or maybe they didn't even have one - talk about their depression. My depression is environmental).It's easy to compare yourself to others in two ways: (1) see how disadvantaged you are by looking at how happy your peers and other folks are with their family (2) trying to minimize your situation by looking at how unfortunate others are compared to you, and trying to normalize or feel grateful for what you do have (like feeling thankful for having an abusive parent, because at least you have a parent or because at least sometimes they're nice, or etc.)Although you should definitely observe cues from other peoples' lives and realize that what is happening to you is wrong (so you don't grow up thinking you deserve what happens or normalize it), know it's all very adaptable: know, that you don't have to minimize your situation or minimize the holiday season to get through it. Enjoy it, because this is your life and no one can take it away from you. And remember, when you're older, you can have a family of your own and have the best fucking holidays ever. Another thing to note (kinda a vent of a personal fear of mine) is sometimes my family forces the holiday season, don't participate if you don't feel comfortable. It's hard but I've realized every time I go along with it, it predictably turns into a scene, and/or I just enable my abusers and minimize the shit they've done to me. It's okay to not want to be around the people that hurt you, even if you want to give them another chance, even if you want to try, you can wait till you're older and have more control over the situation. That's all. My heart and love and prayers go out to everyone struggling this holiday season, no matter what the issue. Have the best holiday you can possibly have because fuck depression and fuck abusive family - you deserve the best.","1"
"I dropped out of school when I was 11 and pretty much just sat at home jerking off and watching TV for 4 years.

Times you suddenly seem mean to me for no big reason or don't try to fix things with me. Times I try to tell you how much you mean to me and you ignore me. Sometimes you make me feel really unimportant even if you don't mean to. I just explode when you do these things. I have to hold in my tears at school and act like some girl that lives on a different continent might not really be my friend, which is causing me to feel so miserable.Although you have upset me many times, I do believe you are a real friend when my thoughts are going less crazy and my mind has calmed down. I remember the times you would literally get MAD at me for not telling you why I was upset, and the times you said so many kind things about me, and times how you said you would love to see me in person and hug me. You live over 7,000 miles away from me yet you are the closest friend I have ever had. I would love to spend a day with you, give you a tour of the things to do in my city and just hang out with you.I am so sorry for the hurt I have caused. I want you back in my life so bad. I am explosive and clingy and sensitive and weak and all this shit makes me say some nasty things to the people I care most about. I wish you would believe I care about you, and not just creepily obsessed with you. I am clingy, but I don't have posters of your face on my wall and I don't want to be in a boyfriend-girlfriend relationship, and I don't want to marry you someday. I want you to just be my best friend again, or even just a casual friend. I want to see you some day, and hug you and tell you how you're like a sister to me at times, and if I start feeling sad I want to hug you and cry and keep you near me.Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck. I wish I could just stay calm when you hurt me. I wish you would understand how much I care about you. I wish your mom wouldn't tell me to kill myself. I wish you would know that I almost never mean the nasty things I say, and that you would understand how you hurt me but how I still care about you. Holy fucking shit what am I even saying anymore, I just want you back so bad.I hope you at least someday understand that I care about you, even if you decide you're done with me. I hope you understand the ways you hurt me, and maybe someday you will try to be my friend again and maybe someday we can meet in person and I can hug you and hang out with you and you can meet all my friends from around where I actually live. Or maybe I can visit you, and you take me around your city. I miss you.I am so sorry for the pain I have caused you. I am a little too clingy and insecure and depression isn't helping this friendship. I wish you were back in my life. Thanks for all the times you have been there. Sorry for the verbal vomit. I will always be here for you.","1"
"I've been getting worse and worse the last few weeks. I have been taking my meds every day (Citalopram 40mg once per day) and I can feel them working, but I feel like I'm having a breakdown at least once a day.I've been trying to find someone new to date and I feel like it's really contributing to my sadness. I feel worthless because the only person I've been able to find that has interest in me is blowing me off all of a sudden and it's making me feel very down about myself.I'm not suicidal but I'm starting to feel like if I just kinda didn't exist anymore that would be okay. If that makes sense.It just really stings to hear someone tell you they aren't going anywhere and then stop talking to you. I think I just really need some kind of reassurance right now that everything isn't falling apart.","1"

"From 12 to 22, I've changed. My idealism has been stripped away. I've noticed to the extent that relationships are transactional. That my overly empathetic nature is useless in self-serving society. There's not really such a thing as selfless love. I can't feel very much, probably as a result of my medication. All I can do is act and feign interest when I interact. And I have little desire to interact. It's become a very false thing to me. I feel no true loyalty to anyone.I hate myself for all the time I waste not doing anything. I enrolled in university halftime to give myself a mental break, but it just lead to laziness. These past months flew by as I overslept and overindulged in shows. I know I ought to be studying and making myself a more appealing job candidate. I know I should do these things for my future self (who I'm screwing). But I can't. I frequently just run away from reality via sleep or fall into portrayals of idealized worlds with infallible protagonists. There's nothing I really want here. When I manage to peel myself away from the screen, I'm sort of horrified by reality. As a teen, I used to at the very least keep up with things, read, enjoy learning. I wouldn't let myself fall behind even if I was alone. I was working towards one day having a fulfilling life. That hope. It's gone.I don't care anymore. Only recently I was able to whole-heartedly cry and realize my pain. I can't forgive myself for allowing myself to degrade this far. I'm afraid I can only sink lower. I know what I should do. Go outside, interact, work hard. But I can't slay my dragons. I have atrophied so far I can't even recognize myself. I'm a shell of who I was. And there's no way I'm leaning on anyone else for this. People don't really want to hear or deal with others' problems. People only care as much as it benefits them to. I'm sorry to say that. Maybe I'm a fool but that's what life taught me.I will fuck up my life if I continue down this path. It's not immediately recognizable, the damage one does when they live passively.So, co-miserate with me. Give me some tough love. Words of encouragement. ","1"
"It's fucking 1:36 in the dead of night and I'm far too sad, tired, and pained to sleep. I forgot to take my sleeping pill, of course, lol. My laptop is at 19% and I have 21 dollars to my name until tomorrow. My entire family is asleep upstairs and in the rooms around me, and here I am, staring at the wall, listening to Kat Dahlia, posting on Reddit again. This is a somewhat follow up to last week's post about how my job was getting worse and I'd been victim to a serious nervous breakdown. So far in the past week, my family, and everyone on here has been super supportive of me and taking care of myself. Sorry to those who DM'd me who I never responded too; it's not that I don't want to talk or anything, but right now with the holidays gearing up and me working a dead-end retail job I have no time but to eat sleep and work. :/ Sorry! Anyhow, my store manager wants to move me to Jewelry from Cashier, which is a great position, but for a nearing 20-year-old with a GED in the works and no idea where or who I am or want to be, it's not much. Plus, it pays a good ol' 11.50 an hour, for anywhere from 10 to 40 hours a week with plenty of toxic people. I love what I do and even the customers, but my bosses and coworkers are just disgusting, to be honest. They gossip, stab each other in the back, fight for control and even worse get each other fired. As mentioned in my other posts, I'm the 5th longest employee in my department to stay there, and our most senior employee has made it 5 years. I've been there almost a year now and the sheer uncertainty of it all scares me every day I come in. I've had my job threatened over nothing 3 times.That, and my mental health has degraded so far that I can't find pleasure or even bring myself to do the things I used to love, and my dad is worried I'm so depressed I might end it. I don't want to get there, or worry him, or be where I am. I have no idea how I let it all get so far out of control. I wish I knew how to fix myself or help myself. Maybe I should just quit. I'm just afraid I can't find another job, or I'll be labeled a leech or something like a basement dweller. I want to be in control of my life, but it seems everyone is afraid I'll never be who I want to be, and I can't let them down. Sorry for such a long post, and I wish I had a way to condense it but this is just stream of thought. ","1"

"I feel as if everything around me is falling apart and my motivation to do anything has withered. I used to be driven to do law. I even signed a contract to do my undergrad at UC Berkeley and I'm about to lose it due to my lack of motivation to even want to get out of bed, let alone keep up with 5 fucking APs and debate. and what scares me the most is that I dont even care. I have this rising resentment inside of me for my family and just anything that requires effort. Maybe that makes me lazy but I really just cant find any purpose in doing anything. and oddly, suicide almost feels comforting.

"So Ive already had depression for a year and a half now, but ever since June-Sept 2017 Ive been feeling so much better. Then during October, I found out that the girl Ive liked for so long is dating someone and Ive been heartbroken ever since. My depression came back and its much worse than before. I would have mood swings everyday and some days I have no motivation to do anything. I guess part of why Im depressed because Ive never got to fully have a chance with this girl. Weve only ever had small talk once in a while, but we were never at a point  where we got super close. I was planning to confess to her this year, but knowing that I now cant really hurts me more than anything. And everyday I have to see her with her boyfriend, all happy and cheery together. And as a person whos been dead and have no emotions for the longest time ever, Ive cried for someone for the first time ever. Everyday within the first week of finding out. Ive tried moving on but there really isnt someone for me out there. Im stuck in this shitty situation what can I do?","1"

"So Im autistic, to get that out of the way.  Ive been acutely depressed for almost two years now, and non-acutely depressed my entire life.  Im an opiate addict, a benzodiazepine addict, and a nicotine addict.I recently found that cbd allowed me to have emotional connections with people in ways that Id never had before.  I cared so much about everybodys life, and I for once in my life genuinely wanted to share in their emotions.Fast forward to Monday.Im driving back to school from Home for thanksgiving (12 hours).  At the exact halfway point I get into an accident.  Im not a stranger to accidents.  I bump into other peoples cars with my own fairly often because of how easily distracted I am.  Ive always come away with just a scratch in the paint and no real damage.This wasnt like that.  A billboard caught my attention and I glanced that way and started drifting.  Into the trailer wheel of the car hauling a classic car next to me.  My right front wheel is practically torn off, so its completely undrivable.  Im 6 hours away from either place I could call home.The police come, standard report, no injuries.  The people with the trailer were able to just drive away.  No damage.  But my car is a wreck.  Im autistic, so the moment this all happened I went into the worst meltdown Id ever had.  I couldnt stop crying and shaking, and once or twice almost darted out into oncoming traffic.  Luckily, I called my parents and they walked me through everything and said they were on their way.  But its a 6 hour drive and I have to wait somewhere, which we decide to be a hospital.The police officer was supposed to take me but got called off on dispatch before the tow truck could get there.  The tow truck drivers said they couldnt take me anywhere.  Roadside assistance said they couldnt take me anywhere.  So an ambulance was called.  But they couldnt take my biggest box in the ambulance.This box contained my Nintendo Switch and pro controller, along with all of my games.  I couldnt take it with me, so I had to leave it in the car and trust the towing company.Mistake.The next day, upon arriving at the repair shop I found that my all of my valuables were missing.Fuck.This game console was one of the few things in life that gave me joy.  I cant afford to buy a new one.  I have to spend that money on opiates.  Cue more meltdowns.  The first time Ive screamed at my parents.  So here I am.  I was just beginning to learn to love and share emotions with others and somebody does this to me.What the fuck.Edit: a wordSecond edit:Seriously, what the fuck?!?  What did I do to deserve this on top of every other piece of shit thing thats happened to me in my life?  Why wont my parents just fucking give up on me and let me kill myself?","1"

"I'm going to be brutally honest here. I've been into porn from a young age (back when the internet would go down if someone was using the phone in the house) At 26 my hormone levels still get a bit crazy each day and I need my fix. The most I have ever fapped in one day is twice which isn't that bad. I have a PornHub account and I know a lot of pornstars (male and female by name) I also follow a lot of them on my Instagram (I don't even care what people think lol) and have a seperate Twitter account I use when I'm horny (unlike other social media sites Twitter is pretty open to 18+ content, I don't use my RL profile picture on that account obviously I follow tons of performers on there and it's nice to see the other side of them sometimes) I paid for Pornhub Premium by accident once (free trial gone wrong) I don't know if I'm addicted and I don't know if it helps deal with depression or makes it worse. Personally don't feel guilty most of the time. I know it's just a fantasy but when I have to fap I can't resist it. Obviously having a girlfriend would be better but even then I think I would still fap. It's just sex isn't it? Should men feel shame for loving porn?I'm also into hentai but I'll admit that's a little fucked up at times. I can't watch incest, rape or tentacle shit.","1"
"I'm getting tired of battling with my thoughts everyday. Happiness has eluded me for as long as I can remember. My brain seems programmed to constantly loathe myself even though I know I'm a good person and that I should love myself. I've tried meditation and mindfulness but the effects are temporary. I hit my lowest last year during my senior year of high school (I know this is a shitty time in life for a lot of people) and things have improved since but it's still lingering. It's frustrating to know that I lead an extremely privileged life but can't take advantage of it because of my fucked up head. I'm wondering if there's anyone out there who has an experience similar to mine and has found something that helps. I'm going to the doctor pretty soon to hopefully be prescribed a mild antidepressant. Also I have multiple family members who have suffered from depression so I'm thinking I could be predisposed. Thanks for reading.","1"
"Sorry if I'm bad at this its my first time and if you're reading this thank you. I just wanted to get some stuff off my chest because I can't trust anyone enough to tell them anything and my struggling to cope.I'm a 17 year old male and I see myself with no future. I have an eating disorder called ARFID which I have lived with since I was 3 years old. ARFID makes it extremely hard to try new foods but I must have some rare case where it also affects my drinking. Usually I have a piece of toast for breakfast with cheese, a packet of crisps for lunch because I don't like the canteen food, and a small dinner. My diet is terrible and I only drink fizzy drinks. I have tried to drink water multiple times but I can only manage a couple of sips before I start gagging which in some cases led to me being sick. I don't eat veg and I only eat fruit some days. This eating disorder makes me avoid going outside if it involves eating with others so I only leave the house for college and to visit my grandparents. This is because at restaurants the waiter will always give me a funny look when they give me what is considered a ""kids"" meal and I feel like every person in there is staring at me making me feel so stupid.What makes it worse is that my parents are divorced. My dad has a girlfriend who has two kids, both are teenagers, and every time we go out for food her son always has a funny look when he sees the food I have on my plate compared to him and everyone else. It makes me feel like I'm not normal. I've tried to avoid going out for meals but my mum thinks that I just want to play my computer games.I'm afraid to tell my family about it because they will just suggest things that I know won't produce results but they think that it will. The only possible way for me to get rid of it is hypnosis which is expensive as there is only one known person who has a high success rate and I don't want my family paying for that because I'm just a burden to them, I'd rather them have the money to spend on themselves.I feel like people want nothing to do with me. The only best friend I had ditched me two days in a row to hang out with his new friends from the school he moved to. I was with 4 of my close family members and I told them I was going to meet up with my friend. 10 minutes later I have to walk into the room and explain to them that he didn't show up where we arranged to meet and when I phoned him he was with a group of other people. It was so embarrassing and I had to pretend like I didn't care because sometimes when I cry in front of my mum she tells me I'm too old to cry and boys don't cry.I don't have a single person in this world that I can trust to tell them how I really feel. I just cry in my room quietly once everyone has gone too sleep and listen to rap like Eminem, token and my personal favourite NF. If your still reading this and like rap about depression I strongly recommend NF, he has some really good music.In secondary school I drifted away from all of my close friends from my primary school because their new friends didn't like me. I've always been shy around new people and I was happy with the friends that I had so I didn't put much effort into making new friends. I had a group of friends who I play computer games with who are from my town but they have other friends who I don't like so I don't meet up with them outside of college. My grades started slipping in secondary school because I lost all interest in everything. I quit the football team I played for and my grades went from A's to struggling to get C's. My mum always says ""I know you could've done better if you didn't play your computer games so much"" but that's not the case, I just don't care anymore they mean nothing to me.I started off good I'm college, I made friends with the majority of people in my class and was getting distinctions in most of my subjects. About half way through the first year I got that attitude back. I kept thinking what's the point? Why should these grades determine my life? I don't want to compete with people to have a hard job that pays good money. All I want is to be happy. Money isn't the most important thing to me, I just want to be around people who I can talk to about anything and that I can feel comfortable around.My life doesn't matter anyway. I will die a premature death because of my eating disorder and I don't think there's anyway to stop a premature death. I'm not afraid to die but I don't want my family to have to suffer with me dying which is the reason why I won't commit suicide.If you read any of this I appreciate it and I hope you're doing ok.","1"
"I don't know. I went to this subreddit with the intention to relieve myself. I wanted to talk the pressure away that I constantly feel. Now I'm sitting in front of my screen staring at the screen (duh) without anything coming to my mind. I had an idea, some sort of structure for what I was going to write down. Right now I am just writing down things that come to my mind when I think about myself. Well yeah. I am 19 years old (in the bloom of youth lel), coming from a middle class family, money isn't raining on me but it's not like I have to pinch pennies. I have a car and a roof above my head, both of my parents, my brother and my sister are alive and healthy. Its kind of funny that I am including my siblings in this list. They are total strangers to me, I feel like I don't know anything about them besides their name and age and I am not sure about their age. One could say that I am a pathetic piece of shit wallowing in self-pity because I am not appreciating what I have. I totally agree if anyone likes to say that, except for the last part. Is it really self-pity? I don't fucking now. The world is such a messed up place. We humans are trapped in an economy system that we invented and can't stop anymore. Capitalism is the root of most bad stuff that happens around the globe. No matter what the problem or issue is, in the end it comes down to money. It's all about money. Money money money. An abstract product we invented ourselves and now the invention has enslaved its inventor. I came to this conclusion quite a few years ago and yet I'm writing this on a Razer keyboard staring at an Asus screen, wearing Nike pants. How ironic. This world is fucked and there won't be any change. I don't even know why I'm telling this to you guys but I won't delete it now. The point is - if this mess of a text has a point -  I feel empty. I feel so damn empty. I'm feeling like I'm faking a whole person throughout the day at work. My life has no purpose, I have no purpose, no one has a purpose. I became so disconnected from my family and relatives, even close friends. I chat, crack a joke here and there but as soon as I am alone there's nothing but guilt, worries, doubts over doubts and this goddamn habit of questioning every single stupid little thing of my pointless life. Sometimes I think that I am not me anymore. It sounds pathetic and sad at the same time, but there is the thought that I am not the person I am. I sometimes feel like there is the person that my body represents and that everybody knows, and then there's me. My head or brain so to say. What the fuck am I even writing here. Maybe I should mention that I got diagnosed with severe depression a few years ago but I never accepted it nor did anything to battle it. The psychologist told me the results and I got up, left the room and never came back. I didn't call for another appointment or anything. Mostly because I won't let somebody label me like this. Oh yeah, lets stuff him in the drawer where these other people with mental illnesses are. Nope. Sometimes I feel like going on a killing spree but it's not that easy in my country to get the right tools. Sounds kinda sick what I just wrote down. On the other hand I never physically attacked anyone and I probably never will, mostly because I am a weak little stick. Did I mention that my BMI is 16.84? A lot of people see food and eating as something that you must enjoy. I don't. I just stuff something inside my stomach every few days to make the noise and cramps stop. Call it life long suicide haha. Why am I even telling this. I just don't know what to do. It's like being constantly bored, 24/7/365, but you are bored and disgusted by your own person, personality, life, whatever. I am constantly shifting between caring about everything, thinking about the future of humanity and planet earth, having (more or less) well planned ideas about saving this or doing that. Two days (or hours) later I feel nothing but hate and disgust. It's not that severe during daytime because there's always something going on, something that distracts me or keeps me busy. I often find myself staring at the wall or the floor for... I seriously don't know how long. Sometimes it's like my body falls asleep but my mind is more or less awake but without any conscious thoughts. At least without any thoughts I can remember. I want to kill myself, but then I think about my friends and parents and how much this would hurt them, but at the same time I'm thinking ""why should I care? I'm not there anymore to feel any pain"" and of course I know that everyone who might be hurt is still there, being alive. I can talk to myself for hours like that. Nothing makes sense, everything makes sense, nothing has a purpose, everything has a purpose... I don't know and frankly I don't fucking care. At least for now. Until I have the next emotional high that lasts for a few hours or two days and after that we're going down the rabbit hole again.I just wrote down a lot of bullshit. A lot of shit. Shitty shit. I just read through it again and I am kinda disgusted but at the same time I'm thinking ""I don't fucking care"". Yeah. A whole paragraph of embarrassing, pathetic self-pity bullshit. I could jump right out of the fucking window. But I know that I'm too lazy and afraid, mostly because the thing I call myself is an embarrassing mess. I wish that I could just stop existing with the press of a button. ""Huh there are guns for that"" - yeah well, good luck getting your hands on one. I had the intention to end this text and now I'm writing all of that bullshit down. I should really get a rope or something. Fuck it. If you read to this point I owe you an apology because you just wasted your time. Did you really waste it? Would you have done something brilliant in that time? Why I am I even asking these questions like I am some sort of preacher. A preacher of nihilism at  best. Fuck it. Lets make this the last time I've ever posted something anywhere.","1"
"I had just finished college and bought my first car last June. It cost all of my money. It was a great car for its price and could have lasted me years. I was in a minor accident a mere two weeks after getting it, but it was only 50 worth of damage so I got off easy. I got a job working minimum wage in a call center for insurance the same month. Its an ok job but the money is mere peanuts for the labor of having to listen to people shout at me all day. I'm currently back living with my parents after college in a rural village and don't have many friends. All of them are either living back in Galway where I went to college or have moved to England or Canada. My life is basically get up, go to work, go home, spend the rest of my day on my laptop, sleep. A pretty dull life but my plan was to build up money, get my own place and find a good job with my software degree down in Dublin. However since last month, thinks started to take a turn for the worst. I was told I may not pass probation and will be let go by December because of my call quality. My alcoholic brother tried to choke me to death and I refuse to speak to him anymore. And to top it all off, I totaled my new car yesterday after skidding on black ice and rolled down a hill into a farmers field, destroying his gate and fencing. I came out unharmed but felt like a total idiot as I downright refused to learn my lesson about speeding last time. Now I have no car, the one thing I had, barely any money to buy a new one, have to pay for the damage to the farmers property, and I am in the process of losing my crappy job should I not pass probation. I am literally going nowhere in life. I feel it has no purpose. I barely speak to my friends, only my parents. My mother (despite good intentions) treats me like a child and my father always just berates me on what I should and shouldn't do. I just wish I died in that car accident and stopped being a burden to both them and the world.","1"

She's ""just a dog"" to society but to me she's family and I can't stand how I can't find her or she could be dead and if they're caught all they have to do is go to jail for a while. I just can't. I miss her... so...much... ","1"
"It's starting to become a problem. Like i'm sleeping when i'm not tired mostly just to avoid reality. If theres some important date on the horizon or some event that i'm dreading I sleep to try and prolong the time I have until whatever it is comes. Never works though; It always just feels like a waste when I wake up. Its not fulfilling sleep either, as I frequently wake up and go back to sleep at maybe hour or so intervals. I also have no energy, but im unsure as to whether its caused by oversleeping or the other way around. Maybe theyre unrelated. It definetly hurts my selfimage of myself. Makes me feel useless, like a waste. Donno.","1"
"I don't really know. I can't sleep at night anymore, and am incredibly unproductive. I don't eat much even though I know I should, but I'm not that hungry. I feel really alone. I don't know how people meet other who like them and want to be with them. I try not to show how sad I am in public, so It's not like I'm scaring people off that way. I have some friends, but they are all new because It's first semester of Freshman year. I have one close friend, and I feel lucky to have even one, but I don't really want to put this on her since there's nothing she can really do about it. I really like feeling needed, so I end up being the person a lot of my friends go to to talk to. I often feel like I am giving more than I'm getting though, and while I love being there for people, even people I don't know, it's kind of hard. I don't want to tell any of my friends I'm struggling this much because I don't want them to see that side of me. But it's so hard for me to seek help. There are so many steps and I'm already busy. I tried to reach out earlier this year, and got pretty far but then I lost motivation to continue. I constantly think about dying, but I know I would never do it. I keep thinking about what I want to do in the future, like travel and things like that, but each day it seems less and less likely I'll ever get there because there's college, and then possibly grad school, and then I have to work to pay off debts, and I'll probably just get stuck in a job for the rest of my life. I don't even know what I want to do with my life. It doesn't help that I don't really have interests and I'm not really that great at anything. I feel like I'm drowning in my school work but it's my own fault because I procrastinate so much (like right now) and I blame most things on my adhd including not eating as much as I know I should. It's scaring me though because before I knew I had adhd, in high school I wouldn't eat on purpose because when everything else in my mind was chaos, what I put in my body was something I could fully control. Losing weight was my one success when I was struggling with everything else. It's been years since then and I have gotten better, but since often I'm so busy I forget to eat, or I'm just not hungry, I feel like I'm getting sucked back in. I know I've lost weight, and I'm scared that I like the feeling of achievement from it. Also a guy I may or may not have had a crush on (one of my only guy friends) decided it would be fun to gaslight me which hurt because I thought we were friends... I haven't talked to him in a week and I kind of miss him, but I was always the one to start conversations so I feel like even though he said he liked talking to me, I was just annoying him. Plus even if we ended up going out, it wouldn't be fair to him. I'm too messed up right now for anyone to have to deal with. Plus I feel like I would have to go really slowly in the physical part of a relationship because this guy at a party tried to touch me when I was drunk. Nothing happened as far as I know but I don't feel comfortable anymore. But most guys at my school are only looking for a hookup, so it looks like I'll be alone for a long time. I don't think I can just live one day at a time anymore. I feel like I'm not experiencing life. I feel like I am breathing stale air and everything Is fake, and nothing matters. On top of all this emotional shit is the fact that I have finals soon, and I'm not ready and I have had a tension headache for a week and it won't go away with Advil. I'm pretty sure it's because I don't sleep enough, but I physically can't fall asleep no matter how long I lay in bed and ""fake it till I make it""If you read all of this, wow. I hope all of you have a better day than I'm having.","1"
"If you go trough my account you can see that anxiety, self-injury, depression and suicidal ideation are some very frequently reoccurring problems in my life.I had been researching bridges and jumping off them and went to a bridge on Sunday night in the city 45 minutes away from my home. I actually tried to go to one bridge and then decided to go home, but I had to cross a river to get back into the state, so I crossed another bridge, wanted to get out to see the bridge, and parked (actually in my state and walked back into the the city). I stayed on the bridge for a while and called my professor who stayed on the line with me until I went back to my car and who then called my parents.  My dad spoke to me and my mom refused too, but I don't have a great or comofortable relationship with my parents.I went to a psychiatric hospital the next day with a friend to get a psych assessment done, and went back today, but nothing much came of it because they do case management and the lady said my social worker I've been seeing for therapy is acting as my case manager.  I did not get commited even after telling them the bridge thing and admitting self-harm. Unfortunately, I didn't get to see a psychiatrist.I told my therapist on Tuesday and this increased her concern for me exponentially.  Unknown to me, after the last session when I had read parts of my blog saying I wanted to do things like jump into a rock quarry and commit suicide by cop, she had been looking up other therapy services for me and low-income psychiatric care.  She wants to begin meeting with me twice a week from now on, which seems like a lot, but her, me and my friends and professor thought the treatment I was receiving was not sufficient.I'm working out my options and the women at the psychiatric hospital talked to me about a day hospital program on a sliding  scale with a psychiatrist and sliding scale psychiatrists. My therapist talked to me about a DBT group and low income psychiatrists as well.Many people have expressed they love me and care about me, so I feel I'm less likely to attempt to do this a third time than ever.  I hope I can pursue more intensive treatment, because the next stop after for me would literally be death. I'm even excited to take medication because I've spent my older childhood, teenagehood and adulthood unable to focus, lacking motivation, failing school, paranoid, anxious and many other unpleasant things.Things are going much better and I hope other people on here can get help too.","1"

"So Monday I briefly talked with a teacher who I trust a bit about how Im feeling. He recommended  I talk to the school psychologist and with my permission emailed him to make an appointment with me. So today I had to go and see the school psychologist. I only talked to him for about ten minutes before he was interrupted by having to go to where a fight broke out (Im in high school). He wants to meet with me tomorrow. I honestly didnt like the session today. I felt like I was talking to a script. Lots of basic questions like hows your home life, any recent big changes, etc. It did confirm that I dont feel good. I had to hold back tears. The problem is the rest of the day I felt so bad because the appointment surfaced all the negative feelings Im having. On a completely unrelated note I came today to find out we have to put our dog down Friday. I feel awful about that. I really dont want to talk to the school psychologist tomorrow. Should I email him and say that, ask the teacher who recommended I see him email him , or go in and just say I dont want to talk to him. I think talking about how I feel could be good in the future but now is not a good time. Im not sure what to do.","1"

"As far back as I can remember, I've known a feeling of anxiety. Depression usually followed right after or vice versa.At a young age I was exposed to a lot. My parents were young, my mother was 18 when I was born and my step-dad was 16 (my mother was already pregnant when they started dating.) They had a rather good support system between my (assumed, long story for another post) bio-father's side of the family being involved throughout and after my birth, my mom's side being involved and my step-dad's family being very involved.My step-dad was strict, but forgiving. Mean, but soft. My mother tells me all the time how my (to clear things up, incase I write more than I am intending to atm, ""dad"" is my step-dad and ""father"" is my assumed bio-father) dad was always fascinated with the way I was quite intuitive and intelligent at a young age. He loved me as his own and that love still holds true today.My parents had another kid, my sister, 2 years later and my brother came another 2 years later. I don't remember much before my little brother's birth, but I do remember some great and terrible things from when I can.My parents went through a lot of drama between infidelity, alcoholism, abuse both ways and I saw them fight quite a few times. Punches, kicks, choke holds, tears, knots, bruises, cuts, blood, sweat. I remember most of them quite vividly but they don't exactly haunt me. They don't make me feel depressed or anything most of the time, but there's times when the memories make me furious or sad. To varying degrees, as well. Some days it's a Denzel tear, others it's a full blown meltdown holding my pillow and sobbing uncontrollably into it.Growing older, I got socially awkward and very introverted. I was a skinny kid until maybe 6 or 7 idk. I got pretty big and self-image was a huge issue for me. I remember beating myself up mentally whenever I looked in mirrors. I felt out of place everywhere I went, rarely feeling ""welcomed"" or invited. I remember feeling shame or guilt often, whether it was warrented or not.I never really approached kids in school, they usually approached me. They were usually the naughtier kids. I moved schools a lot, too. Between all of the moving before I got to HS, I had been to 9 or 10 schools. All of them usually had a similar group of misfits that gravitated toward me. Maybe because they were the only ones not afraid of my rather serious look all the time.Whatever the reason, I was never quite left alone in school.Bullying wasn't a huge problem because I looked rather big and mean, could even be mistaken for the bully most of the time. But there were always a few little shitheads who would poke fun in front of other people for their own ego stroking. I took them rather terribly because I'd beat myself up in my own head without it but with more fuel and real life experience to torment my thoughts, I became more and more introverted and awkward. ESPECIALLY around girls because of my insecurities.At a young age I was also introduced to pornography. A cousin of mine pulled me aside into one of the rooms one day and had me watch one with him. I became aroused and experiemented with that on my own at that time and became addicted to porn immediately. It started to consume my everyday thoughts. I've read that the link between porn addiction and depression is unmistakable, but with so many different events in my life, I assume mine is a culmination of all the tragic events. I remember being depressed before watching porn.After porn entered my life, everything was perversed for me and this created even more isolation and introversion as I associate any affection with sexual arousal. Yet another shithole I fell into. I couldn't be affectionate with anyone because my mind was where I didn't want it to be but I couldn't help it. I knew it was wrong and I also couldn't control it or understand it so I started to feel guilt, disgust and shame daily. Yet I craved affection and attention and love.Fast forward to 8th grade, my younger brother was diagnosed with cancer. A rare form, Desmo Plastic Small Round Cell Tumor. He was transported to the childrens hospital in the city and my sister and I stayed with our grandparents for a few months before moving to the city with my mom to be closer to the hospital. After a long battle, his fight came to an end on August 20th, 2009. Roughly after 10 AM. I remember the day like it was yesterday. I was in my science class watching MythBusters. After the lunch bell rang I gathered up and headed toward the cafeteria, but before I could get there, my mom's boyfriend at the time was there to get me out of school. My heart fell into my stomach as I lied to myself and said my brother was fine over and over, but I knew he wasn't. After waiting what seemed like a century to get to the hospice (I didn't know what that was/meant at the time), and another century waiting inside the hospice without access to my mother, brother or dad. I sat in angst. I already knew. I couldn't cry. I still had a glimmer of hope, or naivete. But, when we were told officially, I felt empty.This made HS miserable, paired with my mother's depression, alcoholism and aching heart. I don't remember days being much different outside of being afraid of getting home to my mom being abused (even tho she started it most of the time,) dreading school because I was unhappy with myself and how awkward I was, and spending hours upon hours in a giant public library doing anything but reading books. They had a counseling class that met once a week but I didn't always go, and I didn't always share anything.There's much more that I went through, but that about sums up what I feel are the roots of my depression. I haven't spoken to any professionals, I have been wanting to the last few days because I've been very depressed and I made a lot of progress within the last 2 months that I don't want to undo.I was in a state of clarity, peace, my mind was clear, I had energy, I could stay on task and finish everything and be ""normal."" I stopped wondering why I was depressed, I stopped feeling it all together and just sort of went with the flow. I found that I slip in and out of this quite often and I never really ""knew"" knew until today. I would say I come in and out of enlightenment.My first big enlightenment that I could fully comprehend came from an incident in which I fell for my best friend who I never even met in person, but rather through Facebook. We never really even talked on FB until one day we did and then somehow we started talking. It was on and off at first, we'd talk for a few days at a time, then a day or week betwen then again. Then one day we just started talking every day. I was in college at the time, but I dropped out after 2 semesters. We talked about everything and she just listened and responded and was invested and showed interest and cared and all the things bestfriends feel like. I knew not to fall in love, that it couldn't be between us, but somehow I was in lala land and I did anyway.One day she killed my ego involuntarily. She was just confiding in me and telling me about an encounter with an ex and I got hurt and jealous and told her then proceeded to block her on everything. I felt numb, I sensation I felt before, but this time it killed my ego. I hit rock botttom. She has forgiven me since and we talk still, but not as often as before. We've both been busy in our own lives so neither of us take it offensive.I slipped back into a state of depression and ego recently and I caught myself when crying in my car lastnight while beating myself up in my mind (the thoughts were not literally of me beating myself, but of me being tortured and weird shit like that by others. Specifically women. Idk why. I'm weird, ok?) I started to question why I had those thoughts and came across a few reddit posts and read through a few. I also swiftly Googled anti-depressants and how they work. What depression is and such. Now I am considering medication, but I am honestly scared to visit the doctor's office. Not entirely sure why either.The moments of clarity or enlightenment or whatever you want to call it, I would like to have much more of that. I am very productive and my mind isn't all over the place and I don't wake up depressed or anxious or beat myself up in my head all day. I suppose I will visit a doctor soon, but being 100% honest idk how long I'll procrastinate. If at all. I'd love to hear from anyone that has experienced something similar either in childhood experiences or the sudden enlightenment/slipping in and out of enlightenment.I know this was a lot to read, but if you did take the time to read all the way through, thank you. I hope to hear replies, questions, suggestions, your stories. Whatever. I'm open for dicussion.","1"

"Every day I am exhausted, emotionally and physically.I had fairly verbally abusive / neglectful family, I feel like I was strong for so long but over time I just got eroded and now there is nothing left. I think about suicide every day, when I wake up, before I go to bed, when I have anything difficult happen during the day..It's almost sick, my main coping mechanism that keeps me going is ""Well if it gets too bad I can just kill myself"".Nervous about meeting a new person? ""Well if it gets too bad I can just kill myself"".Job interview? ""Well if it gets too bad I can just kill myself"".Date?

My friends are all in class or at work or otherwise would be annoyed with me.I tried to make an appointment with my newer therapist for today or tomorrow and the receptionist hung up on me. I think it might have been because I told her I was checking my schedule and she thought I forgot to hang up but I can tell she doesn't like me and I feel like idk she's annoyed with me.There's a drop in at the local lgbt center where I have a case manager who could help me, but yesterday I needed him to talk to me about housing resources (I did my own research and wanted to talk to someone who could advise me if my plan was sound) and he avoided me. The other case manager seemed to be beyond annoyed that I was talking to her and like idk. Every time I talk while I'm there I feel like the people in charge are annoyed with me. I don't want to be a bother me person who makes everything difficult.I'm in bed and I'm still trying to go to class but I don't want to see my roommate because she's in the process of kicking me out and it's really awkward and I've visibly been crying. I don't want to put that on her and make her accuse me of manipulating her. Rational me knows this is all stupid and I should go to class but now me just feels like garbage and I just want to cry more.I wish I had work because if I go to work I can just put all my issues into it and like idk, do a good job and feel better? But I'm not scheduled until Friday.Edit: I fucking trained myself to be alone and to accept that no one would wanna be around me because I'm the worst, and then I made friends and started dating this girl I like a lot and now that no one likes me anymore it hurts. I keep letting myself think I deserve to be around people and deserve anything and then when the truth hits me and I remember what annoying garbage I am it hurts more. The fact that I feel lonely means that I want friends and people in my life when I don't deserve it which is disgusting and if people know how much I wanted people to be kind to me and like me they would be absolutely disgusted.","1"
"To preface, I tried to commit suicide when I was in college. When it didn't work,  I started starving myself and working out 6 hours a day.

I've not tried again outright since the first time, but the weight on me was always there.

"When I started feeling weird, I didn't want to talk about it. I hided it from my closest friends, made excuses for why I was missing classes. Then, I started telling a lot of people, little by little, and since I broke that barrier, I would spend many hours trying to explain how I was feeling. But I felt very tired and frustrated after venting about it. No one ever said something mean or inconsiderate, like ""you're just making excuses"" or ""it's not even a real disease"". No, they never did that, and I know I'm more lucky than most. The thing is, I never felt like they quite get that I felt incapable of doing everyday tasks or to feel pleasure doing stuff. Everytime I said I was sad and unmotivated, they would tell they felt the same way too, and it was normal (it was not normal and not the same). Like, they would act like it was a normal sadness. Or they would tell me to just get distracted, get a hobbie, when it was impossible for me to distract myself from my negative auto-destructive thoughts. Everyone kept giving a lot of generic advise that didn't work out, and I know they had the best intentions, but I felt very frustrated that I couldn't quite explain or speak in a way they would understand how was the feeling. Also, I got this feeling that they were acting like it was a simple problem, with a simple solution. Just get up and be positive. A friend of mine once told me that her grandmother was also depressed, but that she (the grandmother) didn't try and didn't want to be helped, that her grandma was at fault. It's like people think is so easy and they can't get why you're torturing yourself. I know, I know it seems like I'm complaining when I was so lucky they cared about me and supported me the best way they could. And I was being naive to expect people would 100% get me. Also, it's not their obligation to get me or ""fix"" me. It's just I realized it was not working or doing me any good to spend so many hours talking about it with someone else than my therapist. I stopped talking so much about it, but sometimes I compusively start talking about it with my dad or with my mom. I feel very tired and sad and frustrated afterwards. Do you feel the same way?","1"

"I was born with an Imperforate Anus, which mean i don't have an anus when i was born. My parent sold their house to try to fix me. After 6 years on and off the hospital, i finally got a surgery to fix that but it come with its own problem, i can't really control my bowel. I grow up with that situation where i don't know when i'm going to take a dump. It may sound silly, but shitting your pants at a teenager and have them laughing at you is not a comfortable at the slightest. I tried my best at school but i never really excel, whenever i fail something people would told me that my family spent everything on me and i turn out like this, that i'm a burden to everyone. My closet friend move away when i was 12 and was left alone without any friends for a long time. That was when i started feeling depressed. I live with that depression my whole life, but i did a very good job hiding it, no one know i have it, because i always laughing and joking in class and at work. However, when the night come and i was alone with my thought, i always think of myself at a failure and i deserve to die, but i keep pushing on. I finally have a close group of friends, those that i can called my brothers, and thing was good, for a while.I had to move to the US with my family 3 years ago, leaving all my friends and my grandfather behind. In the US, i was alone, having no friend, my family scatter around, barely speaking the language and have to survive by myself, then the depression come back. There are many days that i want to end everything, but somehow i can still keep going. Everyday was as dark as the other, until the day i talked to her. She was my classmate in High school back in my country, we barely talk to each other on facebook, i used to like her back then but she already in a relationship so i didn't start anything then. One day i chatting her up on facebook, she told me about her divorce, how her husband treated her badly. I was there to talk to her, to share everything with her, and before i know it i fell in love with her, and she fell for me. We started a relationship, and those were the best days of my life. We can talk about everything, can joke about everything, we are just like best friend that love each other, everything was perfect. I waited for 6 months before i can comeback to my country to visit her and my friends. That 1 months with them i could never forget.After i got back to the US, i worked my ass off so i can build an actual future with her, and started to talk less because of my schedule. She told my that she was pregnant with my baby a month after i got back to the US, i was overjoy when heard that news. But bad thing keep happening to me, she had a miscarriage and lost our baby. We cried, a lot. Every night i dreamed of a kid who keep following me, i asked them who are they, and they told me ""Why can't i live with you and mom, why can't we be together?"". I cried my eyes out every single night. I tried to work harder so thing like that would never happen again, I thought that by doing it i can marry her and we can live together forever, but she thought that i was avoid her and no longer love her, but never tell me how she felt. There was that 1 extremely bad week when i was pressured by my school, my family, and my job, i barely sleep and had no energy to function. She also had a bad week and want to talk to me about it, however i was to tired to talk to her properly and i just half-assed talking to her. And that was the breaking point, she thought i no longer love her and her feeling for me started to go away. After that one week i began talking to her normally again, but she didn't seem like she want to talk. She said that she was sick and don't want to talk so i told her to remember to take her medicine, i dont want her to get sick, and i stopped calling her, yet still message her everyday. She never reply. One day I asked her and she told me that she no longer love me.The whole world crashing down on me. I begged, I cried, I explained to her everything, she wouldn't give me a chance. I was gonna ask her to marry me next summer, now everything is gone. I cried for the whole week, many time i was so close to commiting suicide but i held back because maybe i can still win her back. So I kept caring for her, talking to her although she never reply. I thought if I show her how much i really love her she will change her mind. Until one day i found out she already got a new lover before she broke up with me, and that crushed me. I asked her if she has anything going on with that person, and she agressively refused to answer. She told me that do i want to control her, that i always think what i want to think and never listen to her, she never did anything wrong, and she can answer it but she doesn't want to. My heart broke, i just want her to admit it herself so i know that she is still truthful with me, but she couldn't do it. I show her the proof and she change her tone, she said she couldn't lie to me so she couldn't said no. I felt like she has been lying to me for a long time. But i can't bring myself to be angry at her, i still love her so much. She came to me when i was in my darkest moments, she was the hope, the light that help me overcome everything. When she left, she took away all of that, now i'm alone with my own depression, when my mom saw me crying because of her, she told me to kill myself. I was closer to the edge than ever, i just want her back, i begged her and her new lover to let her comeback to me, that obviously failed. I talked to a lot of people, they all tell me that this will past, just try to forget her, everything will be fine .etc. I tried to go on with my normal life but she keep popping up in my head, her voice, her face, her smell, everything, and the depression hit. My kid comeback in my dream and asked me ""Why mom and dad fight? Why you are not together anymore?"". I tried to keep pushing on, I really did, but I can't imagine living a life without her. I can be working and studying 1 moment, and broke down the next moment because her memories came back in my head. I can't keep it going any longer and this time i think i will going through with it. All the pain and humiliation i suffered when i was young, the pain of being away from my friends, the pain of losing my kid, and the pain of losing my love, my hope is too much to bear any longer.","1"
"my mental state was neglected by my parents up till my breakdowns became worse and they finally believed me. started by going to my GP, then to a therapist, guidance counsellor, psychiatrist (where i was medicated for a year), and finally a psychotherapist and CBT. None of them made any improvement on my mental stability or intrusive thoughts, only showed me how to bottle it better and keep it better hidden. ive experiemented with drugs and none of them other than mdma made me feel any bit better.when is it time to call it quits and accept that it doesnt get better?","1"

"I don't even know why I ended up here. But I'm sure about one thing, and that's definitely that I love expressing my feelings.I'm feeling dead every night; especially around 02:00-05:00 where I just listen to sad musics, do nothing but cry, try to kill myself, while I post about my depression on my social media accounts seeing my family doing nothing but seeing me suffering hurts me even more, so many people I care about probably even forgot my existence while I want to end my life fearing there could be an afterlife which scares me even more, I don't wanna go to a hell or whatever, I just wanna die and not existOn the other side i wanna have a failed suicide attempt just so my family cares about me again or go back in time and not drop out of school All I do is staying at home laying in my bed and fearing that my parents would ever find out anything which would make everything worse wishing i could have an ok looking face so I could ever be i  any kind of relationship Watching my cousins becoming successful while I'm jobless and doing noting but harming my parents wasting their money thinking my dead would help them way more than my existence everyone i ever cared for slowly disappeared mostly because I was just acting stupid, and I can't even hate myself more for being depressed in an age of 16 while other people loose their parents in a war and have been going through more than I ever did but don't post about their problems I mostly cry remembering the good old 2012 where I was sleeping at my friends , playing Playstation 2 together , going out, having way less problems than now, actually being in a school and not realizing how good I had it, sometimes i just can't remember things up to 40-60 minutesdon't know why I'm writing all of this, just wanna make my first ever post on reddit and let it all outI just wanna take a pill and vanish from existence,goodnight Reddit ","1"
"Hi everybody,I'm a 34 year old male who has been dealing with depression since I was a child and I absolutely hate myself. I've been on a couple dozen medications and dealt with just as many doctors, counselors and therapists. I've also been hospitalized for attempted suicide twice in my life.I don't consider myself as having any real worth as a person. I have a physical reaction, similar to cringing, when anyone says something nice about me. I give suicide serious consideration at least a few times a week and have just general, ""I should kill myself"" thoughts multiple times a day. There are times when I look in the mirror and feel a very real urge to punch the person I see there.I don't feel that life is worth living. At best I distract myself for a few hours at a time, playing games, hanging out with friends or just getting high and watching wrestling. But even during the best of these times the sudden feeling of absolute despair can just come out of seemingly nowhere, as if I just tripped into a hole I didn't see coming.I can't imagine a future in which I don't kill myself. The thought of living another 30 years is disgusting. I can really only come up with two satisfactory reasons not to kill myself, aside from the natural fear of the pain/death, and they're both financial responsibilities to people close to me.And yes, there are people close to me. I care about these people and I accept as fact that they care about me, and when I'm spending time with them is when I feel the best. But I also feel resentful, because I feel like I need to have a babysitter to not be absolutely miserable. Which of course makes me not want to spend time with people to spite myself.On rare occasions, I feel like maybe I can have a future career, home, relationship hobby, whatever, but then I stop and ""realise"" how much those things would be wasted on me and how I shouldn't bother because I would just screw it up, ruin it, or it just wouldn't work for some reason that would obviously be my fault.I don't really have any questions and I'm not asking for advice or help. I just felt like writing out my situation for strangers to read.And if you did, then thanks.","1"

"I could be broken up with by 1000 different people and none of it would be hitting as hard as this. A couple months ago I told him i couldn't go on with our friendship, my anxiety and depression was getting so bad and i thought he was to blame, instead of talking it through with him I just called off years of our friendship like that. After seeing him at a party recently, well everything has been fucked since. I can't sleep or think normally and my heart feels like it's going to explode any fucking second. I spent my whole life with this person, we went through puberty and every other milestone together, we know every detail of eachothers lives and every small detail and every like, dislike and pet peeve. And now I have nobody.  ","1"

"Im very new to reddit, keep in mind Im writing this one mobile. Before I start let me give you an idea who I am. Im Hispanic, male, a junior in high school, overweight (210) 54 in height, Im autistic and am diagnosed with aspergers, so forgive my incoherent writing, I also have mood disorder and adhd Im also currently 17. I know for a fact that Im relapsing. Im normally a neutral feeling person. Not happy, not sad, just blank. Back in 2015-2016 I was in my freshman year at this highschool thats infamous for all of these preppy rich kids. Very few minoritys, and if you were one, you were mostly poor. I had been bullied and had been an outcast since well I started school since kinder. Stupid I know. I have a loving family, Im privileged as hell, shit I own all generations of Xbox consoles, but do keep in mind I worked and saved for those things. Anyways back to the point. I was still crushed over these two girls that rejected me back in 8th grade. And I was in swimming, forgot to mention that. I was slow as hell but I lost a shit ton of weight. Anyways I was super bad at algebra 1. Part of it was a combination of a bad teacher and a bad student. But Im willing to take most of the blame. One of the things this fucker of a teacher did was held me during lunch (keep in mind this was for winter finals) was ask me what does Y in Y=mx+b Stand for? For a whole lunch period (45 or 50 minutes) I sat their and never knew the answer. The bell rang and he said with a jackass smirk, y equals slope. So later on I failed the algebra winter exam and I got swimming (1st period) replaces with two periods of credit/algebra 1 recovery (1st and 2nd period). I was being bullied verbally, mentally, and emotionally, by people I thought I could trust. I had small mental breakdowns earlier in the year but I kept it to myself. Due to my failing grades, my parents took away all of my privileges, phone, games, etc... I was losing my mind. Id sit in my room all day and day dream about those two girls. You know of that viral video MEMEME, remember when he almost catches the girl he lost but she falls? Thats exactly what it felt like. Except I was fighting for something I never had to begin with. One day I snapped. It was around February. I had enough of it. I wrote a hit list and threatened to kill certain staff (that fucker teacher) and select students. I wrote evil things with demonic essence. My demons had taken over. I was moron and told someone about it, which in turn somehow got to a parent and they told the school. Now I wouldnt be in the position I live now if earlier a school tragedy happened. Technically it wasnt the schools problem, as the kid was long gone from the district, but he killed himself. The school took this deeply and bad enough I got harassed for not going to this kids funeral. I believe due to the suicide the school had an adverse reaction to my threats. So my best friend and his mom take me to go eat hot dogs one day, during when we eat, the vice principal would visit my apartment and tell my parents about the hit list. My parents were shocked and my dad almost fainted. Later that night my parents said they had to take me to a hospital for blood work. Blood work at 9 at night, right after I ate? Whatever. Too bad I didnt question it. I was put in a emergency room and then the question came. Did you want to kill anyone? Of course I cried and said no. But in reality and in the current day, I wish I said yes or that I did commit such an act.  I wouldnt  be alive or I would be behind bars where I truly belong I was submitted in a mental hospital for 10 days. Where I got more trauma than I got help. Then IOP for 3 grueling months. I was such an outcast that I had a dream about aliens, which signifies that I feel like an outsider to the situation Im in. I finally got out and finished my rest of the semester. But then came court and the trials. It was a unnerving process. But I came out as innocent and had parole for 6 months and did 8 hours of community service. Keep in mind I was labeled as a terrorist due to the act I planned to commit.  I went to an ok private school than I moved to a  public school, which is the one Im at now. Everything would be fine after that. Granted the private school fucked up my credits and I took junior classes as a sophomore. Now Im a junior and taking sophomore classes . Its awful. So much immaturity. The only classes that are junior are English and math models (technically credit recovery for algebra 1). Now on to the modern day. For that past month my sleep has been rocky. I gained all the weight back but Im attempting to lose it as much as I can. My dad almost kicked me out of the house. I constantly visit some of my former teachers when I was a sophomore at this new school Im currently at. I came around the 2nd semester. But I feel like any of the school staff I pour my heart to I feel like Im bothering in some form or way. Just today my choir teacher (this is my first time ever in choir) said we were having a fundraiser for kids with not so great home life. I kinda got triggered. I wanted to cry but I kept the tears inside. Sometimes I wonder if I ever suffer enough? Ya know? Like I feel like depression and getting abused verbally, mentally and emotionally isnt really suffering? But what do I know right? Im a terrorist, a juvenile delinquent.  I constantly talk to my counselor (bless her) and the school psychologist (bless her too). I feel like Im getting nowhere. Just before the thanksgiving break (I live in the U.S, specifically in Texas), I had emailed them both about my home situation. I cried like a bitch in front of them both and looking at it I feel like a pathetic sack of shit who should be crying.The psychologist got extremely worried due to my extreme sadness and being so low. I feel like the counselor and the psychologist are disgusted with that they have to deal with. But thats I what I feel and theyre both great people who do their job right. I grow tired of caring for school. The other day I fell asleep in geometry and the teacher lectured me about if youre going to use this class to sleep than I will make a parent teacher conference. What a dick. Im like one out of 4 kids who dont give a flying fuck anymore and yet they dont get pestered on. As for today, I feel like shit and have considered just skipping school. It never really truly teaches you about life. I told some teachers before the break that I might not come back to school due to my situation. They all felt sorry. One got extremely worried (bless her heart) and cared. My parents love me, but theyre my parents, not my friends. Theyre people I have to legally live with for the time being. I feel sad with no clear feeling of motivation. Ive considered just dropping out but Im not sure. After the events I went through, I have no clue who I am anymore...","1"
"I am living a good life. Somehow I haven't been happy for 2 months now. Each day it's getting worse. Today I couldn't even get out of bed. Some people called me, but I don't feel like answering.

"I go through bouts of extremely extremely low self esteem, and it's absolutely brutal. Being out in public is like torture, and I can't focus very well on things because my mind is racing with negative thoughts about how horrible my appearance is. I can't describe the feeling but it's so bad. The hatred I have for my body, while knowing it's the only one I'll ever have shatters me. I'm stuck in this repulsive body. Every step is pure shame. It's this horrible dreadful feeling, I can physically feel it in my stomach. It weighs me down. It gets so bad that I don't even want to leave the house, it puts too much stress on my mind being out where people can see me. I literally feel so ashamed I feel I should hide away. My opinion of myself is so strong too I don't know if I could ever believe otherwise. ","1"
"Depression level; not even sure how to start this, or even if anyone will read/reply. Figured a flashy title would at least draw a click or two. For the record, yes, acute lymphoblastic leukemia type B.Mine has been a life that I loathe revealing to others. Whether too fucked up or too unbelievable, anytime I reveal any part of myself to someone I care for it seems to drive them away. To the point where I'm at now; 29, estranged from family with no real friends. I started this with the intent to do my first full 'this was my life' confessional, just to see if there was anyone, anywhere, who could understand. This will likely be a long read, consider yourself warned.The setting; early nineties white privileged suburbia. My mother was a horrendous addict, and my father an emotionally dim alpha male. Though he did well providing for my sister and I financially, that was really it. One of my first memories is of waking up to him dragging me down the stairs and outside through the mud, because I had accidentally left a hose on earlier that day, and then shitting myself with terror as he screamed at me. Another is of my mother crashing her car into the side of our house because she was so fucked up on pain killers and god knows what else.Around age ten, she abandoned my sister (she was five at the time) and I, after she had cleaned house of any and all valuables. This included some of our treasured playthings. It was like a giant black 'X' was then placed on us, the neighborhood parents didn't want their kids to be exposed to either of our hurt, confused, mortified selves. We didn't hear from her for years to come.Growing up, I was never allowed to pursue things I wanted. Unless it involved sportsball or anything ultra physical literally everything I liked was ridiculed or flat out denied to me by my father. I'm a total nerd, full blown tabletop/video/literary roleplay gamer. I had to hide my video games, my dungeons and dragons stuff, what few manga/anime things I could get my hands on, hell even mere books and comics. I was yelled at, for reading. Joke was on him when I was in an accident that fucked my knee up permanently, and left me with a ghastly facial wound. He could forget any sort of sport anything after that.Never performed well in school, even as a child I couldn't summon enough fucks about whatever was being lectured. I daydreamed, and didn't talk much to others. Never had any close friendships, quite the opposite really. Had more bullies than friends, even was suspended from middle school when I finally snapped at one in the middle of class. Teacher turned on me like I was at fault, and stupid scared embarrassed me threatened to kill everyone in the classroom before breaking down into tears and running from class. Days later I was escorted from campus in handcuffs.High school was much worse. My freshman year started so well it seemed. Made a couple friends quick, didn't do to well in classes as usual but at least I had people I clicked with. Then I started to get ill. It was strange, I had no appetite but was gaining incredible amounts of weight. Lethargy gripped me constantly, and soon so did large splotchy bruises from literally nothing. My father accused me of hording and hiding food, and denied any plea of unwellness I had made.Finally I began vomiting water I had just drank, and we went to the ER. This was a big deal, because it was valentine's day and god forbid my father had to cancel a date with his woman of the month. To this day I still remember my blood being drawn, and seeing this purple sludge fill the syringe instead. Less than a month after my fifteenth birthday, I was diagnosed with cancer.Chemotherapy for childhood leukemia is very aggressive, but for reason; back then it was the only option. It was that or the cancer. My first few weeks I nearly died from my kidneys (and thus everything else) shutting down, and again months later from a chemo-induced seizure that of course occurred on Christmas. I spent the next year mostly hospitalized, with only nurses and the occasional volunteer for company. Father was always too busy with work, and sister dependent on him to come into the city and see me. My new friends were absent.I had the usual assortment of aunts, uncles, cousins, grandparents etc. Only one pair of aunt/uncle came to visit, and they were just passing through town. The only light in that time, was in the first true friend I ever made. We'll call her Joy, for that's what she was.Joy was the only other person near my age with the same diagnosis. Sweet, caring and personable, we were both oft too sick to see one another in person, but we talked on the phone almost daily. Anytime one of us was well enough to walk though, you'd find us in the other's room down the hall. I fell in love for the first time, and never said anything. She died later that year. Her cancer won. To this day, I wish it had been me instead. The years that followed are a blur of chemo, the usual shitty experiences social rejects face in high school, and a newfound hell that was compulsive lying to my family. To the point where I was GRATEFUL my grandfather passed, just to shift attention from me. Life was a constant torrent of pain, angst, and loathing for myself and everyone near me. You hear heroic tales of people overcoming their cancers and going out to do amazing things. I was not one of these cases. I sucked at being a survivor. And by 18 that's what I was. I somehow managed to graduate, even if it was a summer late. Much to my father's chagrin. He pushed me to go to college, but at the time the idea of more fucking classes when I had just cheated death was terrible. I just wanted to relax, maybe actually enjoy life a little. By now I had made a couple good friends, people who were good to me that I ultimately betrayed out of envy.One of them even helped me move out, let me stay with him and his family for a few months before I was going to start culinary school. That was until my mother resurfaced. She had moved to live near her parents a couple states away, and still struggled with addiction. Never admitted it, but her family told me everything. On top of that, she was diagnosed with a rare auto-immune disorder, and needed help navigating day to day life. I in my infinite wisdom, decided to move there to help her and reconnect with that side of the family. And in the process, had forsaken all of my father's side. Including my little sister.It was dysfunctional, but for the first time I felt I had family that cared. Too ignorant to realize my mother still used, I was blinded by home cooked meals, heart to hearts and other maternal frivolity that I had missed my whole life. Even had sunday dinner with the grandparents, cousins, my favorite uncle, and his wife who had always detested me for being my mother's son.I met a girl, fell in love, and even started going to college to study my ultimate passion; creative writing. I'm still in debt thanks to the useless but lovely couple years I spent pursuing my passion. The girl and I got out first apartment together, adopted a couple cats, and seemed to have a normal, pleasant life. We grew very close to a group of friends, one even becoming my best and most trusted outside the girlfriend.Her and I dealt with my mother relapsing over and over, dealt with our mess of trust issues, anxiety and depression. Smoked weed, screwed like rabbits, and reveled in being alive. It wasn't a perfect life, but it was the happiest I had been. Until my mother snapped with a midlife crisis, revealed her bipolar disorder, and was hospitalized after totally shutting down. She died weeks after release from the psychiatry ward from a sudden heart attack. Our last conversation was meant to be a prelude for an argument against her new clearly unstable boyfriend.Weeks later, I found out my girl and my best friend had been screwing behind my back. And all my friends knew. Only one came forward. My mum's side of the family all but abandoned me. They were all devastated from the loss too, and none had any time for me I guess. I tried to swallow a bottle of xanax one night, but chickened out. The next several months are a blur or work, booze and bud. I had a work buddy, and a couple friends in other states I had met gaming over the years, but that was really it. When I lost my job, due to drinking on the clock, I was simply over everything. One of my gaming friends, someone I had grown to trust, offered me a fresh start in a new state. I moved in with her and her fiance, also a gaming friend. They've seen me now at my best, and at my worst, and haven't seemed to scare off. I love them, and miss them. Though we'll still see a movie together maybe once every six months or so, they're now married and on that family building grind. I don't blame them, and do cheer them the fuck on from afar. Won't deny the sickening bubble of envy that rises every time I have to be around them.Had a girl for a couple years, and it was the gentlest, most loving relationship I had ever experienced. She was way out of my league, biomedical engineering major, ballroom dancer, and overall ray of sunshine. Great gal it seemed, only for her to one day admit that our relationship was holding her back. I was a good man, she said. But felt I could be a great one someday. For someone else.This was a blessing in disguise. I had friends that helped me get through that break up, got my own apartment, had reliable work as a cook and even began to reconnect with my father and sister. Who have both grown drastically, to the point where I don't even recognize them anymore. In a positive way. Even began to exercise and lost a lot of weight. So wrapped up in my internal crap over a lifetime, I was simply in denial over my 300lb+ self.For the next couple years to follow, I found myself in a spiritual renaissance. I was the fittest I had ever been, found some semblance of faith in myself, others, and the universe, even adopted a cat. My friends were few, but accepting of my quirks and general preference for solitude. I was as close to happy and at peace as I had ever been. I wrote constantly, even began drafting plans for my first novel when I mostly stuck to prose. Still wanted female attention, but despite my best, most embarrassing efforts nothing has come of it. The closest was with one of these friends, a girl I mostly played Destiny with who lives in the next state. For a summer we talked constantly, revealed things to each other we normally wouldn't to anyone else, and admitted some attraction. She always told me to have no expectations, but I let my heart and dick get the better of me and fell for her. It was apparently not mutual after all. We barely talk now and when we do it's that horrible shallow small talk I'm sure we all know and hate.My other friends have all but vanished too, busy with their own lives and relationships. Now hanging out usually means having to be the third wheel with my friends. I'd rather be alone than a third wheel, so here I've begun to find myself increasingly reclusive. I lost a job, which I didn't mind cause it was a very toxic environment, but the following job hunt and couple weeks unemployed has slain my meager savings. I've found another gig, but it's more of the same grind I can barely stand.I'm finding myself broke, lonely, and stressed as we enter the holiday season- a time I've never handled well. I spend every holiday alone, only ever invited by my father who is half the country away. It kills me every time one of my new associates asks 'OH HEY YOU GOING TO YOUR MOM'S FOR [insert holiday]?'.I never know how to reply to those. Can't just be all 'I would love to, but her lifetime of bad decisions I emulate on the regular ultimately led to her heart fucking failing and now I panic about this very thing only every few minutes.', or 'I'd spend it with friends, but my reclusive nature and distrust of everyone near me prevents that. Oh and none of them ever invite me so there's that.'Literally the past couple months, my social experiences have been the once or twice a week gaming session with that one friend I mentioned, and another who I want to like. But naturally since it seems there's a thing between him and her even that is turning into third wheel crap.Everything I love is falling apart. This is literally the most I've written all year I think. Even then I've reread, edited, and hated every word that's been put down. I'm frustrated with myself physically, still in the best shape I've ever been but between loose skin and the fact that there's STILL fucking fat despite the work I put I still look like a husky fuck. And as I stare down the big three-oh in a little over a month, I have to admit... I think I'm done. Not just this, which I've spent the past couple hours typing up. I shudder to think how long it would've taken had I delved deeper into the fuckery that is my life.I think I'm done living. Everyday I wake up just as tired as when I went to bed. Each work out is a goddam trial to motivate for and complete, only to feel it's pointless after. I'm terrible at talking to people in general, let alone women, so my social life shouldn't even be called that. I don't hate my new job, but I'd so much rather not be there.The one thought that I have more than anything else lately... is the title. Not just that it had won, but Joy had lived. That my family and friends would've been spared the shit presence that was myself in their lives. That my miserable existence would've ended earlier. That I won't have to spend another birthday alone.I'm a coward, and can't bring myself to end things. I secretly wish for death, like a car or meteorite to hit me. A way out of this institution that is America in its 20-teens.If you read this, I thank you. If it goes ignored, well, I wouldn't be surprised. At the very least I feel empty instead of internal agony after writing this.","1"
"Hello,I don't really feel like I mean much. I've been depressed for about 5 years now (currently 20yo), with some breaks in between but during those times I felt ""neutral"" at best. I've always been the outsider of the group. I've always been the guy who has to stand just outside the circle, or walks just behind the rest. I'm not the most talkative person but that can't be the reason people always give me weird looks, right? Do I act weird and just don't notice it? Do I walk or talk or look weird? I don't think I'm a bad looking guy, not really handsome or anything, but good enough. Yet I never get the feeling people actually care about me, or even see me as on of their own.I guess my autism is just too noticeable. Because yeah, that's what I have. I know it's a bit of a meme, but to be serious, it does seriously damage your ability to socialize. I want to have friends and a girlfriend as much as the next guy, but I'm just so terrible at holding up long-term and close relationships. I can't hold a conversation properly, or even look someone in the eye for more than a second. I'm so awful at conveying emotion that I just come across as a soulless, boring weirdo. And well, that is really what I am. I just can't get myself to care about socializing anymore, but at the same time I hate not being able to socialize. I'm just tired of being the outcast, of getting all those weird looks. I want to actually have fun with life, without constantly fucking myself over with my autistic tendencies. I just wish I was normal.","1"
"Assuming they love you back. Why are you depressed then?I always feel like if someone loved me my depression would be so much less terrible. Or maybe it's my depression telling me that.I have a decent number of friends. I just.. don't feel anything for anyone. I don't feel a connection with anyone. I just feel so lonely all of the damn time. I feel so empty all the time unless I'm preoccupied with something else. Maybe it's because I'm not comfortable around.. anyone. I feel like if I make one mistake they instantly start to hate me and start looking for people to replace me with. I wish I was comfortable around people. I wish I could be myself without fear of everyone leaving me. I just hate being alone. I hate that ive been wasting my time on someone who doesn't even want me in their future. I hate feeling like everyone is being insincere with me literally all of the time. I hate feeling fine for a while and then just every so once in a while feeling like I'd make everyone else's life better if I just liked myself. I just want to be happy. More than anything. Why is it so fucking hard. What the fuck is wrong with me. It's so painful. No one actually cares about me. I could kill myself right now and people would only be upset because I'm not there to buy them shit, or because I ruined their idea of what a family should be like, Im constantly disappointing people without even trying to. I wish someone would just be proud of me for.. something. But no. I'm just a stupid piece of shit who's not good at anything. There's always someone better than me. I'm never good enough for anyone. It'd be one thing if I wasn't trying but I am, and that makes me feel so much more pathetic. If I'm going to continue to feel this pain I just want to end it. All I want is love. Acceptance. That's all I ever fucking wanted. Everyone else gets it except for me. I'm just a sidepiece in everyone's life. I'm insignificant to everyone. No one would care. No one would miss me.I hate myself.

"Yeah I'm 17. I'm kind of ""drifting"" through school at the moment.When I'm busy through the day, I don't give it too much thought. It's when I come home, every night when I sit in bed. When the mind is idle it wanders and I start to consider whether living is worth it or not. I want to join the Army and escape from this hell I'm in but that's two years ahead, way too long. And even after that, then what? Go to college and become a slightly better nobody with a slightly better paying job? I sometimes feel like it's too hard to go to school, get out of bed, wake up alive the next morning. I don't want to deal with this world. I never consented to being born, I don't want to go tomorrow and deal with my problems. I don't want to eat the same old oatmeal, I'd rather eat a bullet. My parents say I have an IQ of 135 but I certainly don't feel that way. I don't feel alive, I don't know what happened, but I've been like this for the last two years. I don't enjoy the things I used to anymore, and I'm starting to see life as it really is. Bleak and desolate and dead.The more time goes by, the more ""happy"" people I see... The more I want to put a bullet in my head and end it all.","1"
"Really anything.I'm in a very poor place right now. I feel like there's nothing I can do and I'm afraid to have to work to get better at it.  I think I'm afraid that I will start, spend precious times of my life on it only to fail.  Usually, if I don't achieve something in a short time, I start feeling horribly unmotivated and depressed.I have trouble making friends because it doesn't happen immediately.I don't want to go back to college because I'm afraid I'll fail.I even saw a ""positive"" post from someone talking about how they're getting over there depression, but I just saw the words ""it'll be a long process"" and froze up.I don't know what to do.","1"
"This is going to be a long rant(im on mobile, sorry if formatting is weird).I'm a 16 year old male and I live in a group home. I feel like all the other kids here hate me. I guess I'm not very likeable because I'm nothing like the rest of them. I am roomates with a kid who speaks very little English and he is an asshole, but there is nothing I can do about it. He is 18. He uses his phone late at night unmuted and talks loudly to his girlfriend. He also does a lot of other things that are rude like not closing the door when he leaves the room, playing his music really loud, and hanging stuff off my bed. I don't like him and there isn't anything I can do about it. I could tell him what I don't like but I doubt anything would change. I thought that I would try to be an asshole to him back because it seemed like a good idea at the time. I decided not to close the door when I left the room and that made him pissed off like I thought it would. He came out and told me to close the door when I leave and I told him suck my dick, so he punched me. I, being a little bitch, did nothing back and didn't tell any of the staff. That obviously left me feeling like shit because I brought it upon myself. I know this sounds really whiny. Tonight, he was moving the bed to clean under it( it's a bunk bed and I'm on the top) and he had no problem moving the bed while I was on it. When he moved it back he told me to get off the bed and I told him no. He cussed at me in his language and I cussed at him back. I didn't know why he wanted me to get off the bed. He then told one of the staff here that speaks his language that I objected to his cleaning and cussed him out. One of other staff that thinks I'm a liar because I gave him conflicting times for an event I wanted to go to(and other reasons), asked me for my side of it. I at first didn't think anything of what had just happened, so I told him nothing happened. Then he talked to me more and I finally told him my side of the story. He didn't believe me of course, because I'm an untrustworthy liar and I was changing my story. Then the other staff came in and told me that I have been poking at my roomate for a while now and that he is not someone I should mess with. They both believed what he said and made me feel like garbage. I've been crying a lot lately hating myself and everyone around me. I know that people care about me, like my friends who are trying to get me out of the group home to live with them, and my sister. Reading this entire thing it sounds like I'm just whining over nothing and that I am actually an asshole. Maybe I am, nobody in this house likes me. I feel like I should just die because then I wouldn't get in anyone's way and people wouldn't have to deal with me anymore. I'm a piece of shit. I'll probably delete this later. Thanks for sitting through my incoherent garbage.","1"
"I am 25 and I lost the girl of my dreams about two years ago. Our relationship was probably one of the most dysfunctional ones out there. On the surface we seemed like the ideal couple, and to each other it seemed that way as well. We were either both blind or both in denial of course. Well the delusion finally ended, as few lies ever remained buried forever. It pains me to even think about her, to the point that sometimes I feel a pain in my chest. People tell me to just get out there, and I will get over her, and it will pass with time. All I can say is, I hope I just get hit by a bus, because that seems much more likely. I think of her daily still and not even because I go looking for grief. I wake up and think about her. She was everything for me. It feels like I am losing a grip on my sanity. Its funny, I never thought much of how people go crazy.. well not until recently. The worst thing is, I still love her now and there is not a thing I can do now.","1"
"All my life my parents have been so adamant about me going to college. My mom is threatening to kick me out of her house if I don't go. I'm a 17 year old male senior in high school and I have a girlfriend but I don't even know if she loves me. I try to look to the future and see what I have to work towards but now it just seems like I go to college and spend the rest of my life paying student loans. I'm starting to wonder what the point of it all is. I don't even have my learner's permit yet and I'm almost 18. All I do in my free time is play destiny 2. I've been kicked out of clans over and over again because I'm an asshole apparently. I feel like a fucking loser and I don't know what the fuck to do with my life. My parents made me get a job to pay for college and I haven't taken my ACT yet. My dad bought the online training program for it but I just can't focus when I use it. I don't know what to do. I'm lost. If I was to be asked where I saw myself in 5 or 10 years, I'd say that I have no idea because I can't see myself going anywhere or being anything. I am told that I'm smart by several people, I am in all honors courses in high school. I still feel like a piece of shit. I think about dying every day and I can't bring myself to do it. I have no friends to talk to. I've always been the outcast. I still haven't found something I'm good at. I need help. I feel like a hollow shell of a human.If anyone has advice, please put it in the comments.","1"
"Everyday I wake up feeling horrible about myself. I feel like I dont find happiness in anything, even when I have things I should be extremely grateful for. Im doing well in school, have friends that I talk to on a regular basis, and my family is very loving. No trauma or anything of that sort and Im even decently confident, I just dont see anything worthwhile. I dont know who I should talk to either. Everyone has their own struggles and I feel like I shouldnt put the stress on them if I express how horrible I feel all the time. I truly feel like I would have more suicidal thoughts if I didnt have such a loving family, where I am the only one holding us together at times. Of course my friends/family will care for me but I feel selfish to put my issues in their hands. I have thought about visiting a counselor at my college but purposely avoid it because I dont want to break down in front of someone. I cry myself to sleep most nights fantasizing about driving to my familys property in the country and shooting myself. Regardless if you post any advice, thank you for reading this. I feel like this helps even if its internet strangers. ","1"

"Hi guys. So my ex broke up with me because she felt she wasn't good enough and couldn't love me like I love her. She said she needed space and it has been really tough trying not too break the NC. I wrote a letter saying how I appreciated the two months we spent together and what a wonderful person she was and how I am still there for her. She later emailed saying to leave her alone and that the letter actually made her feel bad. I don't quite know what I'm looking for but was I in the wrong here? Should I just have said nothing? Felt like I needed to write it to get closure for myself.","1"
"i told my ex bestfriend, out of confidence, about my problems, not all of it, a shortened less dark version. but as soon as we fall out, she starts telling everyone about it, including my school. shes turning my friends against me, spreading complete lies. im practically alone throughout the school day. im alone at home aswell but theres a difference. i like being alone on my own. not being alone surrounded by hundreds of people.

"Im just having a really hard time tonight. I feel like Ive been off for a while, slowly regressing. And I didnt want to admit it because I was doing so well. But something is definitely wrong. My suicidal thoughts are slowly creeping back. And I know this feeling, I know these thoughts. I had them for far too long and I dont want them anymore. Its even harder because I know I should be happy. Things are going well for me, objectively,  but I cannot be objective. Im stuck inside my own head and its torture. Escapism isnt an option. Its like Im trapped inside of a movie theater where theyre showing video of my worst mistakes and theres audio of myself just listing everything I hate about myself and everything thats wrong with me. I sincerely dont know what to do. I have no one to talk to about this. No one around me has or has had depression. They dont understand nor want to listen. My good friends are far away. Im not close with my family. Its just getting really hard. Im scared Im going to go back to my sanity of 3 years ago and I really do not want to go back there. Im genuinely frightened. ","1"
"Hey y'all. So, after about a year of being off drugs (quit lexapro after an on-again-off-again relationship for quite some time. I need my orgasms - sorry.) I'm giving Wellbutrin a chance. The internet makes it seem like a magic pill: nothing but weight loss and energy and rainbows and sex drive for days! BUT. Now I'm getting nervous about side effects - specifically, tinnitus. My mother just informed me she briefly took wellbutrin (generic XR 150 mg, same stuff i got) and noticed an increase in tinnitus. Granted, she said that she had already had mild tinnitus anyway and is super sensitive to side effects in most medications, but its got me worried, as she also said her sister has tinnitus, so clearly its a family/genetic thing. I work in radio and most of my job is editing audio, so I would kind of like to not permanently fuck up my ears.I realize everyone reacts differently etc etc but have y'all experienced tinnitus on Wellbutrin? If so, when did it show up/what dosage were you on/did it ever go away/how intense was it? I want to know what to be on the lookout for. If not - I wanna know too! Or any other side effects you may have had. Or wonderful experiences as well! Just trying to be an informed consumer, I guess. My biggest fear is messing up my hearing :(","1"
