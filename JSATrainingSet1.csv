"Hey everybody! If you'd like to contribute to our community journal (described [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Journaling/comments/7dqiqx/anybody_want_to_compile_a_community_journal/)), please fill out [this survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdK_DHZP795VPwscyMJXJbmpwM-PkCP4csenp4RY9FeZghRww/viewform?usp=sf_link). You will have to sign into your Google account to be able to contribute, since the form includes file uploads. Don't worry, though, I'm not a spammer. I'm planning on keeping this form open until the new year, but depending on how many submissions are actually received (and at what rate), that's subject to change.If you have any suggestions for the form or the project as a whole, please let me know! Can't wait to see what you guys come up with.EDIT:Some clarifications appear to be in order. The link does take you directly to a place to submit an entry. Here are some guidelines for your submission:1. One option is to submit plaintext typed or pasted into a provided text box. You won't have to worry about formatting, and I'll take care of that for you.2. Another option is to upload a pdf. This can literally contain anything a pdf can containimages, text, or anything else I may not be aware of. 3. There will be an option to add any special instructions or other comments regarding your entry4. I'd like to be able to credit as many of these entries as possible directly in the collaborative journal, so I do ask for name or reddit username, but you can be anonymous if you prefer.5. In regards to content: There are no rules. If you want to submit one of your favorite journal entries that you've already done, that's awesome. If you want to submit four pages of stream of consciousness, perfect. If you drew something in a ""journal-y"" way, great. If you put something together specifically for this project, that's awesome, too. The important thing is that it's somewhat personal. I'm not just looking for entries that will create a compilation of art and creative writing.  Journaling can make use of those things, but always in a personal, intimate way. That's the goal of what we're creatingto engage in that personal process together.6. Please only submit one entry at a time. An entry can be multiple pages and multiple documents, but should all be the same ""entry"" however you define that. In my case, that would be defined as being from the same day/time or having the same theme, but that can mean different things to different people, and I won't be really enforcing it or anything. Just try to thoughtfully group your submissions if you can. You are, of course, free to submit multiple ""entries"" by submitting the form multiple separate times.Thanks to everyone, and can't wait to see what you come up with!","0.14652761820000001","0.15112048390000002","0.12374484540000001"
"I've been journaling for a few years at this point. I'd say on and off. However, I've been in college the whole time.It seems like in the communities I've passed through in respect to journalling/bullet journalling, the people are also college aged, or stay at home moms or art people. I've been in a group on Facebook that was ""Bullet Journalling for Professionals"" but it was pretty inactive, giving me the impression that everyone is too busy with work/life to  journal. Or maybe their hobbies shifted. Who knows. I don't know.So I'm wondering if there are business professionals, like accountants, finance people, marketing, management. Or not so business, like science/STEM people, or doctors, nurses, etc.So my curiosity is that, is anyone here a 'professional', and did your journalling?","0.1415792853","0.26183384660000003","0.3461934626"

"I heard about journaling a few months ago, and I really think it could benefit me in many ways, but I just don't know how to get started. Can you help me on the following topics?1. What should I write? And when?I heard a lot about a template using bullet points, where at the start of the day you write 3 affirmations, 3 things you are grateful for and 3 things that would make the day fantastic, and then at the end of the day write 3 fantastic things that happened during the day and 3 things that would have made the day even better. This sounds good, but it only keeps track of positive things... aren't the negative things worth to keep track as well? It feels like that the negative things are as important as the positive.I know this template was thought to make things easier, but maybe it's important to write some ""free text"" about other stuff that happens during the day.What I really like it's the idea to write first thing in the day, about positive things you would like to do, so it boosts your mood, and then at the end of the day make kind of a summary of the day.What do you guys think about this?2. Should I use a notebook or an app?I'm really struggling with this... in one hand I'm trying to avoid technology first thing in the day, so a notebook would make more sense... on the other hand I would like to keep a backup in my entries online, so an app like OneDay or Evernote would make more sense in this regard... should I use a notebook and then at the end of the day copy the entry to the app? (It feels I would be wasting time with that...)What are your thoughts about this?Sorry for the stupid questions, but I'm really struggling with this.

"September 15th I started learning how to make comics. I set aside 3 journals for it. See, I had always wanted to comics and recently started getting some positive attention for a concept I had within my little social art community (I am related to several artists, used to do studio art, and taught art). I decided to take it seriously and keep track of how consistent I can be with logging in hours without supervision or someone managing me. One journal I wrote out what I was learning and started building a story idea/working through obstacles. Second one was thumbnails for page layout. Very important but not interesting.Third journal I kept for concept design and this is the one that ultimately sold me. I'm not amazing but I improve very quickly when I apply myself and my learning curve is both visible and accelerated.I learned what my skill level was and looked for a label that could offer me communal assistance while allowing me to have full freedom and no minimum sales requirements (remember I'm fully new) with easy exits written within contracts.Yesterday an indie ""self publishing publisher"" (group of self publishers that trade ad space and information, it's more complicated than that but the main appeal is the freedom while maintaining community support and a label) I wanted to be a part of had a small convention at a comic shop.I brought what I had and showed their top artists/their head of distribution/label head. The con was not set up to scout but I treated it as an opportunity. Hell, I even dressed up.I am now working with the label directly under their top creator! They want my comic to be associated with their label thanks to these journals. They want me on without a finished piece because I showed what I know and how I deliver on timelines/how fast I learn and apply. This is exactly the level of freedom I wanted with the resources I needed. The artist leading me (who I've known about for 12 years) absolutely raved over my work and will be mentoring me so I can get my comic out with less trial and error. They are blown away with what I've learned and made in a few short months (294 hours total including my pitch at the convention).Nobody else got this offer or even a fraction of the facetime and there were a few aspiring artists there. I was the darling of the day because of these journals. I was spoken to not as a novice but as an equal. I can track my progress and they were able to see how fast I am and how I log in hours and they consider me ready to go pro.

"Hello all!  After a post not too long ago about one of our users burning a journal.  It got me thinking, this is someting I want too do about what is happening in my life right now.So here it goes.  Im starting this challenge and Im going to invite everyone here to take apart in it too.#Concept: Complete a journal without ever reading over the pages written.  Apon completion you're allowed to take one single glimps at each page to read what you've written.  Once you've completed reading you're offered two options.  You pass on the journal to be read one more time, followed by the new reader burning the journal.  Or, you can burn it yourself.##My personal Journaling Goal:So with this journal and many others of mine, I like to keep a theme within the journal.  The goal or theme of this journal is the beginnings of a  relationship of mine.  Recently i've been seeing someone, and thus with the completion of this journal about her (whenever that may be).  I'd like for her to perhaps read it if I deem so fit after my final read, and then I/ we will erase it.I plan to save the ashes for a future project, perhaps incorporating or using them to forge an ink and write a more permanent journal.##My Hopes:My hopes for this journal is that as I fill it out I will forget what i've written.  Depending on the time i've taken too fully write this journal cover to cover, i may not remember much of it.Rules:There are three rules to this journal type:1.) you must fill the book out completely.  Starting at page one, and moving through the book for each entry.2.) Only once the book has been finished may it be read.  This reading is allowed to happen over a timespan, but each page may only be read over once. 3.) The book may be passed on after its initial reading for one single reading by another individual.  If its not passed on, then the book should be burned immediately.4.) Optional:  The ashes may be collected and re-purposed for some use similar towards the journals intentions.Ok, so thats what I got about my journal im starting tonight.  If you want to give it a try be my guest!  I'd love to know someone else is interested.  I am going to be working in a 80 page soft covered moleskin journal, as I believe this will burn the easiest.Here it is if you wish to pick one up!

"Hey, everybody! Wouldn't it be cool if we each designed a page or multiple pages and combined them all into one awesome journal? We could collect digital images of each page and make it electronically available to everyone, as well as perhaps get it bound and available to order. (We do like our physical copies of things here!) I think it would be really neat to see all of our perspectives on journaling in the same book.Just making this post to see if there's any interest in this. I'd be happy to spearhead the project if it seems like enough people are willing to participate.edit: The people (7 people so far, to be exact) have spoken. I think we could make a brilliant collaborative journal with just 7 people (well 8, including me),  and if more people join in, then all the better!

(Does anyone have an opinion on using flash drives vs. external drives?)If anyone is curious, I tried Penzu, Journey, Diaro, and briefly, the new Day One for Android. I don't prefer them because:- I am afraid of journal apps coming and going.- I spent money trying premium versions or subscriptions. No app made me feel that being a paid user was worthwhile. When I last used Penzu, you couldn't even e-mail the support desk without being a paid member.- Journey (and Day One) caused me to develop a bad habit: I had to stop what I was doing, take a picture, select my location on the map, and write an entry immediately. Sometimes it kept me from enjoying the moment. I would rather take a picture or a few, then write later. If I want to be sure that I don't forget something (i.e. the admission at a nature park is cash only), I make a quick verbal note with the sound recorder app that came on my phone.Those of you who type in a non-journal-specific program, what do you use?

Her videos are so concise, helpful, friendly, well-made, and best of all? Unique! Her videos answer questions I didn't even know I had, and provide tips that just make for an overall better journaling experience. And she is so encouraging; I feel like we're best friends even though we have never interacted.I also really love Girl and Quill, mainly because her videos are so soothing. Also, she has achieved so much journaling-wise. In her ""journals of 2016"" video, she had a Sterilite box filled with seriously like 30 TN inserts (and she uses the River Paper ones, which makes it even more impressive).

I use it to set up my daily journal entry prompts. Then each day I just insert that template and start writing. In the future I will have the ability to randomly insert from a list of prompts.- Fast and clean Electron app- AES 256 CBC encryption- Single journal file that you can store in your Dropbox, or wherever you like- Custom style types- Pure HTML5 compatible- Syntax highlighting- Insertable templates- Tagging- Image support- Active development# UpcomingI'll be working towards feature parity with The Journal by DavidRM (what I used before this), but the next things I'm working on are:- Mobile app (nothing fancy, just to add entries on the go).- Search. Good fast search.- Multiple folders. They will be tabs above the editor - think of them as master categories.- Linking between entries.- Minimise to tray, and hotkey open.- Notes folder  i.e. non date-related entries.- Emoji support.# DownloadI have a Windows version right now, and a MacOS one as soon as I figure out how to compile SQLcipher for Node on Mac.

I like the idea of keeping a record, but I would like to branch out in other directions and feel if I had good prompts that would help get me in the rhythm of things and eventually I could just write on my own with out prompts.So yeah, anyone know any good apps. Or even resources for good prompts that would help me expand on my journaling adventures??","0.1296149492","0.3267585039","0.2212162614"
"First of all, hello! Journaling has been a huge part of my life for the last 8/9 years, and I cant believe Ive only just found this community of people who share my interest. In July I started writing in my current journal, a beautiful green Leuchtturm notebook that I was in love with when I got it last year. However I was reluctant to start using it as I got a bad feeling from the book - somehow I just knew that bad things were going to happen to me while using it. Over the summer my anxiety and depression started creeping back into my life, and two weeks ago my boyfriend (of one year) and I broke up, which was my main fear. Im emotionally crushed by all of it, and of course Ive been using my journal a lot to process whats happened. Im up to page 107 now and the book contains a lot of pain and heartbreak from the last few weeks. I hate leaving things unfinished, but after the bad vibes I got and the things it now contains, I feel like I want to leave it all behind and start a fresh journal. Part of me wants to keep going until I finish it, then Ill have all of my pre and post breakup emotions in one book as a distinct phase of my life. What do you think I should do? And have you ever gotten a bad feeling from a journal before, and not used it as a result? Im not normally superstitious at all and maybe its just a coincidence, but it just feels really strange to me. Thanks for reading if you made it this far :) ","0.1349287629","0.4616253972","0.085341759"
"Hi all - first time posting here. Hoping you could help. About a month ago, I was thinking about some things I wanted to add to my bullet journal, when I decided I wanted to make ""memory books"" for my kids. In my personal bullet journal, I will sometimes put things like ticket stubs, and I'll add a funny quote or paragraph about something that happened that day after the normal daily to do list and what not. But there's a LOT of really personal stuff in there that I do not want to share with anyone. So I'd like to make these books for -- and at some point, with -- them so we can all enjoy them. I ordered a blank notebook from Amazon for this purpose, and now I just can't decide how to start. It's not as if I can start from their births, it would take me ages to catch up to the present (they are 3 and 5). I thought about waiting until January and go from there, but I'm wondering if anyone has any other novel ideas for how to start this thing. I'm not a very artsy person (my own journal is extremely minimalist in style), but I'm willing to stretch my creative legs a bit for this one.

"New York City. 12:53 PM. Lots of things have been getting to me. I've been getting sensitive. I used to journal before, primarily on the web. I have a blog. But I've often lost touch. This journal will require me to transcribe my thoughts to paper, which is something I have always enjoyed. The feeling of paper, and pen, interwoven and intertwined beneath my fingers. I suppose it's the same feeling as reading a physical book, versus one digitally, there is something about interacting with the book, more so then through digital, being able to write annotations, notes, fold the paper, just the physical act of turning a page, frenzied with excitement at what is about to come next. This is why I am excited to start journaling again. Everything about the process excites me. And as someone who struggles with anxiety and mental health, this will be my therapist. A lot of people have told me to seek one, but I can't afford one, nor would I seek one out. This journal will be used in the same way, in place of physical interaction. Perhaps this is the change I need in my life. I'm never sure of how to end journal entries, the same way I am never sure how to end physical conversations. I suppose I could say bye, or see ya later, but that would be cutting it short. I never like to end conversations. I suppose I can talk about the book I am using to journal. This book I am writing with is one I've had for many years. It used to sit beside my home phone, and be our telephone book. Anytime we have had important notes, or things to say, attention, or information we needed to jot down, we wrote it in here. But, as everyone slowly started getting personal cellular devices, the book somehow got lost in transition. We lost the home phone. Since I've dug it up recently, I've ripped out all the pages that were written to illicit a fresh, new journal since I've could never afford a moleskine. I suppose this will be the true test. It's labeled as sixty pages, but probably only forty now based on how much I've ripped, which should be good, since the end of the year is approaching. Oh God, 2018 is here. I have to go back to reading my book, so this is it. I mean it. I'm done writing.

I'm looking for a hardcover black/brown journal, without any special prints etc on it. It should be an A4 size or something similar, dotted paper. Now I know that lots of people would recommend me one of the journals from Leuchtturm. But I have 2 objections:1. I can only get them online because I don't have a physical reseller nearby, and delivery for the brand is often 1-2 weeks, I'd like to have it ASAP :)2. I don't believe that there aren't any companies out there charging less for the same product. From what I've seen, $35 isn't an exception when it comes to Leuchtturm. I don't feel like dropping that much on a journal, because I'm not yet convinced that I'll stick to it. I also don't see what you get in terms of quality for this price premium, compared to other brands. I've seen many journals of the same sizes and paper thickness that are cheaper, but they're often decorated with prints etc.So yeah, anyone that can point me towards a good dotted journal, simple looks, no special pages required, just a large enough size?

"Hi yall, I ordered a personalized notebook from Moleskine, and had an experience so awful that I wanted to help anyone else considering ordering. - I placed my first order on August 26. Stated on their website is that the order arrives within 3-5 days, or 5-7 if personalized (which mine was). I never received shipping confirmation for this order (which is supposed to be sent automatically when shipped), so on September 17 (12 days after the most generous application of the shipping/personalization timing) I submitted acomplaint    More than 2 days later, I was told my complaint was being forwarded and I would have to wait longer. More than two days after this update, I still had not gotten a response. I was in desperate need of a planner at this point, and, because I thought this order was just a unique train wreck that would not be repeated, was order another planner. This was probably a mistake on my part, but I had thought my other one must have been cancelled or something, and I was getting no response.    On September 22, 27 days after I had placed the order, my first planner arrived. I never received shipping confirmation, and thus had no reason to believe my first planner was ever going to arrive at the time I ordered the second planner. However, I immediately called as soon as I could to cancel my second order on the basis that at every stage in this process Moleskine had failed to follow every customer service policy it had.   During this phone call, I was told Moleskine could not cancel my order because of the personalization I ordered. Because of the extreme inconvenience and extenuating circumstance, I was told that my request would be sent to supervisors for review. I never received any follow up on this request, despite being told they would get back to me before it was sent. The next I heard from Moleskine was a notification that my planner (that I explicitly did not want and reasonably requested not be sent given the above incompetencies) had arrived.  Finally, in perhaps the most painfully ironic development yet, this second planner does not have the personalization I ordered. There was no reason it could not have been cancelled. This was on September 29th. I have since submitted two complaints about the order, and, of course, received no response. Moleskine has, at the very least, stolen from me the money I paid to have my notebook personalized when it was not. And of course there are the dozens of other mistakes that they have made.    So yeah. Moleskine has awful customer service, they fail to follow up, they send their orders late, they forget to personalize, they steal, and they are bad about shipping confirmation. Undoubtedly the worst company I have ever dealt with. I hope anyone considering an order from them reads this and decides otherwise. ","0.061352774500000005","0.6021708846","0.1358940303"

"Hello r/journaling,I'm not a lurker or a regular, but I knew this place existed and thought I'd come here to ask for help. I'm having a small issue that's driving me rather crazy, and I can't figure out if the type of paper I'm writing on just doesn't play well with the pens I'm using, or maybe my pens are just bad.I keep a regular journal--I'm actually on my fourth volume. For this one, I decided to keep a color theme. It's a basic green composition book from Walmart, and whenever a certain event happens, I write down that day's events in either light or dark green. The rest of the time I use other colors besides green, but that's beside the point.Now, when I write with my dark green 1.0 mm Pilot G-2 pen, everything is fine. That pen works and gives me the amount of ink I want. However, I can only find light green in 0.7 mm sizes, and so far I've had two. One was a Pilot G-2 that just refused to work (it would be writing fine and then sort of ""skip,"" so half a letter or a few letters would be just missing because the ink didn't dispense), and my current one is a PaperMate InkJoy gel that started out promising, but lately has started to have issues too. I did check, and both these light green pens have plenty of ink, so it shouldn't be a matter of them running low.What confuses me is that when I'm at school taking notes, both my 1.0 and 0.7 pens work on the paper I use with little to no problems. Most of my school notes are taken on either printed handouts or in a spiral notebook (whose paper seems different than a composition book to me), and all of my pens write fine on these no matter what size they are. But at home, when I'm writing in my journal, 1.0 pens write way better than 0.7 ones in this composition book that I have, and I can't figure out why.The best solution I can think of is to either start using felt-tip pens (after I get some first) for the rest of this journal, or make my next volume a spiral notebook because I know those play well with ballpoint pens. For the most part, I just want to know what's causing this skipping problem, because it drives me nuts when my pens don't work. Also, any suggestions on what else to do are appreciated, I'm sure there are better solutions out there than mine.","0.1926581115","0.2179548442","0.3114584386"

I use papermate flair to color code my journals, but for some illogical reason I started using micron archival ink pens for my main black color. Truth is, I can't stand these pens. They're ridiculously expensive (got mine on a freak sale), run out of ink very quickly, and I can't get anything out of them unless I hold the pen completely vertically as I write. That causes cramping and makes me want to write as little as possible. Are there any archival ink pens that are like normal pens but with the correct ink? Reasonably priced, and maybe even in colors?

"I hope this is okay to post here. I've been lurking for a while on my main account and need help getting over this huge hang up. When I was a teenager, I wrote in my journal religiously. Every bad choice I -- or anyone around me -- made was documented, in explicit detail. I typically carried all of my journals with me because my stepmom was a snoop, but for some reason one day (IIRC it was some test day and I couldn't have anything with me) I left them at home. My stepmom apparently didn't go to work, went through my things, and read everything she could find. She took my journals, with information about... ""bad"" things happening on campus, to my high school administration. I didn't find out until I was called to an office days later and asked to read printed copies of my entries and confirm or deny what they said. I'm 24 now and still not over it. Aside from the damage it did to my relationship with my family, it's left this feeling that journaling is dangerous and can always be used against me. Or anyone I write about. I live with my significant other, whom I trust, but who is to say something like this won't happen again? I feel like I'm missing a part of me when I'm not communicating on paper, but I feel like it's impossible to truly express myself with this fear.  With this context, do you have any advice on getting over the fear of being genuinely vulnerable when privacy is never certain?

"I want to be able to journal. I want to be able to write something down every day or so about how I'm feeling, how my life is going, all that stuff. In theory, it'd be great for me! In practice, I can't stick with it. I always feel like what I'm writing down is too repetitive or not ""worth"" writing down. So I've been searching for a way to make it come more naturally to me and I think I found how I'm going to be able to do it.I found this blog today: http://everythingibought.tumblr.com/The tl;dr of it is that a guy recorded every single thing he purchased for a full year and rated them according to how he felt about the thing purchased on a scale of -10 to +10 and what ""Need"" it satisfied such as Survival, Love, Self-Actualisation, Safety, etc. and wrote a little about the purchase. Then at the end he plotted all of this information onto graphs and made an Annual Report summarising his findings from the year.I already record all of my purchases almost as soon as they happen into budgeting software but budgeting software doesn't exactly give me the space to discuss the purchase, how I felt about it, what lead me to that purchase, nor my feelings a few days after that purchase. I realised upon reading the aforementioned blog that the majority of my more frivolous purchases are directly related to something that's going on in my life. Sure, I don't buy red peppers or onions because I'm trying to fill a void. But I do buy more chocolate than I'd like and in recent memory, it's coincided with feelings other than ""I want sugar"". I buy more of certain foods when I'm sad, I'm more likely to impulse buy things on Amazon when I'm unhappy. And I think that recording what I bought (and what I almost bought) as it happened along with why I felt the need to make the purchase will give me a good way to lead in to what I'm feeling and thinking about at the time. I'm not going to be sitting down specifically with the thought of ""time to write about my feelings!"" because that makes me freeze up. I'm going to sit down thinking ""time to write about why I decided to buy 3kg of chickpeas at 3am!"". Maybe I just bought the chickpeas because I realised at 3am that I'm rapidly running out of chickpeas. Or maybe I bought 3kg of chickpeas at 3am because I was tossing and turning and stressing about other things in my life and I ended up on Amazon to try and distract myself from the negative thoughts I was having.I think this will have two effects on my life.1. I'll probably think a lot harder about purchases before I make them. In an ideal situation, I hope to be able to pull out my notebook and write about the purchase before it's made, rather than after and it might help me to reconsider some of my more pointless purchases. And being able to look back at a previous ""nearly bought"" situation for a particular frivolous item might help me avoid buying it the next time I get the urge.2. It'll help me unload feelings and frustrations without feeling like that's what I'm doing. I'm just telling the story of how I came to have 5 boxes of cereal and a tub of Haribo strawberries being delivered to me by Amazon Prime Now at 8pm on a Tuesday night. And the context of that story just happens to involve some feelings that I've got right now.I'd love to hear opinions on this and if anyone has any suggestions for how to set this up, I'd love to hear them. :) ","0.5702486038","0.1298520416","0.12362249200000001"

"CommonMark is a simple document format capable of expressing formatted text and including images. I chose CommonMark because online journaling websites could die in a few decades, but CommonMark could survive centuries.I could keep my journal in a journal folder. For example, journal entries for 2017 belong to /journal/2017. Those for 2018 belong to /journal/2018. Journal entries could be saved as /journal/2017/2017-07-25.md, /journal/2017/2017-07-30.md, and so on.If you installed Visual Studio Code(VSCode), you could add the journal folder to VSCode explorer, open a CommonMark journal entry in the explorer, and modify CommonMark with the live preview.GhostWriter requires either cmark or pandoc for CommonMark live preview.Since GhostWriter doesn't have explorer, you'll use a separate program as folder explorer. In GhostWriter preview, choose cmark or pandoc instead of SundownTo keep your journal entries for centuries, you need to learn how to keep your data safe.

"Hi, I am new here. I have kept a journal for years on and off, it helps me and I find it therapeutic. However, the first ten years worth of journals I threw away after suddenly getting paranoid about someone reading them, but then I started up journaling again and a few years later got paranoid again, this time I paid to have them scanned and threw out the books. I put the scans onto a secret drive which I lost when I changed my laptop. Since then I have journalled on and off. I've started journals and thrown them away and then started a new one. I started this most recent journal last December and don't write every day, just when I feel the need. Its a lovely Paperblanks journal so I don't really want to get rid of it. I tried to start it off as a positive journal but soon got back into writing about everything, after all life isn't all milk and honey is it? However, I am now getting paranoid again. I have also found, with the help of a good friend, my old scanned journals from the secret drive which have been retrieved. Looking at them on the computer isn't the same and part of me wants to print them out and have them in physical form again. When I read them now I do miss just writing freely as I did then without worry. How can I get past this and just write?Also, do any of you keep a calendar type diary aswell? I have calendar diaries going back years which I find fascinating to read back now and again, they give just snippets of information about daily life, I've never got rid of those. Then a few years ago I started just using the calendar on my phone but its not the same for looking back on so now I keep a paper calendar again in my handbag and also keep recurring events on my phone so I use a bit of both really. I sometimes wonder if I ought to just use the calendar as my main journal, just noting down things and anything I want to rant about do so on separate paper and destroy it afterwards, then I will just build up a collection of small calendars and not bulky notebooks. Having said that I want to start pasting things into my journal and that would be difficult in the pocket calendar.Storage is another issue. I do have a tin with a lock where I kept my old journals before destroying them but eventually that would get full with journals and what if you run out of space?  I do live alone by the way but still get paranoid about my journals being seen. My parents always used to advise me not to write anything down as I once did have my diary read by some work colleagues who went in my handbag while I was out of the office so they advised me not to keep a personal type of diary anymore.Sorry this is a long post but how do you address these issues?","0.1035461575","0.3284162879","0.2319455743"

Likes the outdoors and working with his hands.Maternal Grandmother - She is the sweetest lady. She is super happy all the time and always up for an adventure. She also enjoys the outdoors.Paternal Grandfather - Extremely hard worker. He loves woodworking a building things himself.Paternal Grandmother - Very social and 'loud'. She likes bright things and is always making people laugh.Paternal Step-Grandmother - She loves to garden and is a bit of a homebody.Paternal Step-Grandfather - He plays guitar, flys planes, works hard and plays hard.

"In December of 2016 I toyed with the idea of Journaling and found this wonderful sub (this was prior to making an account, I was lurking really hard). The creativity and dedication I saw on here pushed me to buy a black A5 Moleskin and try it myself. I loved writing in English class, I was always good at it. Having embarked on a degree in Medicine, i've had far less time to read and write and really wanted some creative endeavour to occupy me.So I started writing in January and attempted to write every day. As i'm sure all who read this will know, such targets are rarely stuck to. So from the 17th of January to the 12th of February I made 15 entries. What I realised over the course of this period, was that the act of writing down the events of that day, or the past few days,  and my thoughts about them, was making me unhappy.When you're around anyone for a long period of time, be it family or friends, certain mannerisms can start to grate on you. Something they might have said in passing may in that moment irritate you, and be a mental substrate on which to pick at for the next few hours before being swiftly forgotten the next day. Its the way of the mind; over time, that which is unimportant or insignificant is sifted out of our memory. The act of journaling subverted this usual occurrence. All the petty gripes of that day or week, all the perceived slights against me, all the annoyances and grievances came into livid focus as I wrote. And the act of writing also solidified these negative thoughts into memory, and I started to resent my friends at university, becoming more hateful and more solitary over the pettiest of things. It was becoming really unhealthy. So, I stopped. But I'd like to ask, has anyone else experienced this? If so, what have they done to mitigate this kind of thing happening while keeping a journal?","0.31718495490000004","0.3432562947","0.145886004"

"Hi, I feel like it'd be beneficial for me to start journaling but a couple things are stopping me.For one, I'm scared to open up. I don't want to write anything specific or revealing, or write anyone's names, because of an irrational fear of people reading it. I know consciously there's really nothing to worry about - I can keep it secure - but I still feel uncomfortable about it for privacy reasons.I also can't decide whether to do a physical journal or one on my phone/laptop. Pros for a physical one would be that I feel like I'd much prefer actually writing to typing, and I like practicing my penmanship. However, a digital one would be more secure, and I feel like there's a level of permanence involved in physically writing things down that's more binding than digitally recording them. Also, convenience - I always have my phone. (If I do decide to go digital, I'd love recommendations. I have an iPhone and Windows laptop, and would like an app that has a web/desktop version as well.)There's also a certain level of unease that I have with the idea of writing down my innermost thoughts because I feel like I'll always be too uncomfortable with my own writing to re-read them, and the concept of having my feelings and thoughts written out like that makes me feel very vulnerable..

"Hello to all. This may seem kind of weird, but I find myself really wanting to journal. I want to be able to journal about something at the end of my day.

Like what if someone finds this and reads my embarrassing feelings or crappy writing? Or if I look back and hate what I wrote because it's amateurish. Writing prompts seem interesting because they help me think and give me a starting point, but I have trouble finding right ones for me. It's possible I'm thinking about it too hard but I do not know.

"Hi,&nbsp;I've been journaling for more than two years all by my Android phone. I find that journaling on a mobile phone is great cause it's always available to me and I don't have to worry about losing it. &nbsp;However, most of the journal apps are very basic, they usually allow me to add photos to entries and categorize them by tags. I want a better way to easily track the progress of the things I'm doing or do journal base on some specific topics (like the gratitude journal, failure journal, daily reflection,... ). So, I decided to build my own journal app and after putting a lot of time to it, the app now available on Google Play Store as Journal it!.&nbsp;Beside the auto sync and support photos, the main features of the app are ""Journeys"" and ""Activities"" which can solve the problem I mentioned above. &nbsp;I've used it for a few month and really happy with it.

"##Hey everyone!So without going too much into my career choices, I am starting a new journal.  Basically, while on my way to work I had a ""discussion in my head"" as to why I would buy a franchisee.  So with that thought in mind, as a young 20 year old.  I've decided to start a 4th journal. (the others have failed as they were daily journals).  This journal however, is outlined and used only to document my milestones in my path to purchasing my first franchise.  Things like investments to get there, how much money I made when and where.  Where I worked, and wadges I made, savings accounts I've used.  Basically anything related to how I want to be a leader, and how I will achieve my goal of becoming a franchisee will eventually be written.  There is no hope for the journal other than a personal memory book.  So I can look back and look forwards.##If anyone is curious.  I am writing my journal in a [Palomino Blackwing Ruled Journal](http://amzn.to/2qtWCyV).  I am writing with a [Twsbi  Diamond 580AL](http://amzn.to/2qu6wkg) and use basically any ink.

"Something I do in my journals I think is a bit unique: I write to the future. I'm not sure if anybody else does that, but if they do I think it's a very good idea. Those are what my purple pens are for. I truly believe there is a need for communication between people from all walks of life and from different generations. It's too bad that in that respect, communications can only be one-way, past to future. I think this will help the future descendants learn not only about me and their family history, but about the times before them. I am not yet a father, but I do intend to be some day. Hopefully the future descendants will read the letters and realize that problems existed long before they were born, and problems similar to the ones they may face at that. Or they will learn the others had similar experiences to them and they got through them.As well, imagine that you have a relative who, by the time you could remember them, was in their eighties or nineties. You may not have understood much about them, and they may have seemed kind of scary to you. But years after they are gone, you discover through their writings that they were lively, had numerous interests, were passionate, and that they wrote to you decades before you were even born. Somebody in the past hoped that you would be there and read what they wrote; what they wrote to you.That's sort of what I hope to accomplish in writing to my future descendants. I don't want anybody reading my journals until long after I am gone. 50 years after I'm dead or the year 2100, whichever happens further in the future. I don't trust anybody now to reading my volumes, but I'm OK with future descendants whom I know I will never meet reading them.Journaling can be a way of educating the future.

"Hello fellow Journalers!  I recently started journaling this past December and I really enjoy it. I've been titling my journal entries. I'll add the date, time, location and then a short title to summarize what I'll be talking about below that, if there is a big topic on my mind that I know I'll be writing about.

I use journaling as a means to capture those small, fleeting memories from my past that come up in flashbacks or dreams, and it's helped me contextualize and piece together a timeline of my childhood.

"[Some examples of my entries](https://imgur.com/a/vOHwc)Someone shared journal pages recently and that inspired me to do the same. I was excited to find this subreddit since it relates to something I consider to be a hobby. My journal is definitely a prized possession of mine.I have been journaling on and off since elementary school. I don't know how it came to be, but I suppose it came naturally with my love of writing. It became more important in middle school since those were the days I began feeling insecure and alone. It fell off a bit in high school, but I'd say college is when my journaling habit became more serious. I stopped writing so much about what I did that day and started focusing more on serious topics. I consider my journal to be the space where I engage in a dialogue with myself to sort out my internal struggles and explore new concepts and ideas. Sometimes I feel like coloring, or sometimes I paste in a poem that didn't quite work out for me. My journal is truly a creative space that I turn to when I need that moment for myself. I could go on forever about what it means to me.The two journals pictured are a Moleskine and a leather bound one which my boyfriend bought for me as a gift. I use pens (felt tip, ink) to write, but I will used color pencils to add some flare. I also collage things on the pages, which I always find to be fun.I feel a little anxious sharing these pages since they're personal, but I enjoyed the privilege of seeing inside someone's journal so I thought I would share too!

"In April 2013 I started a positive journal. I got the idea from a Ted Talk by Matt Cutts called Try Something New For 30 Days. In entry 1 I wrote down a list of things that made me happy, enjoyed doing and was grateful for. The next day I typed up 3 things that were positive that happened the day before. As I write this blog post I have journaled over 3,000 positive things that have happened in my life. The positive things I journal about range from really small micro wins such as found a matching pair of socks and in other cases really big wins such as the birth of my sons. Below I have a list of some of the positive things that I have journaled about through the years. A lot of people say that I have a very positive view of the world and I am in a good mood the vast majority of the day. I dont think this is by accident, its something I really work on and I have found by having dedicated time to myself to focus on my thoughts it really helps.By focusing on being consistent with my morning ritual I have built up momentum and trained myself to have a positive mindset. I have kept a positive journal since April 2013 but a few things have compounded my positive outlook on life and I know these things to be true.After attending a Tony Robbins seminar in January he gave me the gift of 3 techniques that take no longer than 15 minutes to complete. I like them so much that I usually spend about 30 minutes completing the techniques. I believe the term Tony uses is called Priming (below are the techniques)I have done them without fail consistently since January the 8th and they took me to the next level of having a positive mindset. I then added one more to the list and my mood went from feeling good to feeling incredible, feeling so good some days I wanted to cry with sheer joy. That one thing I added to my daily ritual was doing a small good deed for a person every day. I started off small, dropping old clothes to the Simon Community, buying coffee, socks, toothbrush and toothpaste for homeless people. I then started to ask homeless people their name and spent some time drinking coffee I purchased with them. I found spending a few moments with the person had a big impact on me and I like to think brightened up their day in a small way. My outlook on life changed. I then shared some of the experiences with my colleagues in my office and asked them to do one good deed for a colleague per day during the week, the catch was you couldnt tell them who it was from until the end of the week.The results 40 + people doing random acts of kindness from making people lunches, a compliment jar, two team members washed another colleagues car at lunchtime. I got the reaction on film it was priceless. My personal favourite was the whole office pitching in four Euro to replace a colleagues bike after it was stolen. That one combined good deed was extra special as it was a collective effort.Below are some things I know now / do since completing the journal.My morning ritual to get me in a positive stateThink about 10 things that were positive that happen yesterdayThink about 10 things you are grateful forVisualise 5 things you want to bring into your lifeThink about a time you really laughed and think back to every moment of that feelingCycle to work after dropping my son to crecheFirst thing I do once I get into work is write down 3 positive things that happened the day beforeShake everyones hand in the office Things to guarantee to put me in a good moodExercise 30 minutes after getting up for a minimum of 20 minutes and you will have endorphins kicking in till 12pmExercise with loud music you like and you will feel even betterDance to your favourite song (Im a bad dancer so this itself is a funny thing) afterwards and you will feel amazingPerform a nice deed for someone every day expecting nothing in return  GAME CHANGERThink about a sliding doors moment where something really positive happened to you purely by chance and the positive consequences that occurred because of it. Get yourself into a positive mindset in 30 secondsIf I want to supercharge my morning I think about a time when I was in a great mood and reenact how I felt at the time. For example when Robbie Brady scored a goal at the Euros. I jumped up and down the house and screamed with joy, (what made this even better was my two infant sons copied my behaviour), when I want to get back into that state I do the same actions. Works 100% of the time.Excellent Ted TalksSimon Sinek  how great leaders inspire action  People dont buy what you do they buy why you do it. Love this line.Derek Sivers  how to start a movement  I tried this out on Tuesday  I looked up in the sky outside our office by myself for 1 minute. Then at 1-minute intervals several of my colleagues joined me and replicated it. The results over 20 people stopped and looked into the sky. The second person is the leader.Jeremy Heimans  What new power looks like  In 2011, the Indian social activistAnna Hazareused missed calls to pressure the Indian parliament to pass a long-delayed anti-corruption bill.Matt Cutts  Try something new for 30 days  Its how I got started !Great TV To Watch in No order (April 2013  Sept 2016)Wolf HallHouse of CardsBreaking BadBoardwalk EmpireGame of ThronesSilicon ValleyBetter Caul SaulFargoWalking Dead Season 1 & 2Mad Men & Making A MurdererExcellent Books to readInfluenceThe One ThingEssentialismThe One Minute ManagerOpen Andre AgassiRich Dad Poor DadChicken Soup for the SoulNapoleon HillInspirational stories / get you pumped / feel goodChristian the Lion  Inspirational storyJust Do It  (Watch the whole thing will get you in a positive mindset)I am Champion  Guaranteed to get you pumped What I learned from Drinking Alcohol The first drink is the nicest after that it goes downhill and not worth doing itThe small steps matter when you are not in a good moodGet up and do little things when you are not feeling good.

"I've been journaling for maybe... 4/5 years now. I've picked it up and put it down a lot, and recently picked it back up again. I don't know anyone personally that keeps a journal, so when I stumbled across this subreddit, I was happily surprised!With that said, I wanted to share some of my entries / how my journals have been filled up to this point. This might be a long post and it might contain stuff that's kinda personal to me, but I really just wanted to display the effort and time that's gone in.So far, I've gone through 3 journals, with a [4th one about halfway full now.] (https://image.ibb.co/jm1qGF/1overv2.jpg)Previously, I used to just find journals with covers I particularly liked. Recently I've decided to specifically use [Pentalic brand hard-cover sketchbooks] (https://image.ibb.co/b4pMOv/2backing.jpg) as my journals. I liked the plain black covers, and in the future I'd like to buy a bookshelf and stack them side by side; having journals that all matched just seemed right. They're unlined, but I actually like them better for that. The pages are thicker than normal journals, too, which makes doodling with markers a lot less stressful.As for supplies, I currently use a [rather cheap pen I got from Daiso Japan] (https://image.ibb.co/b5beAa/3supp.jpg), for those who don't know, Daiso is a chain of Japanese-import dollar stores that have seemed to spring up around my area as of the last few years. It's definitely not too high-quality, but I find that lighter pens feel nicer to write with, so cheaper materials are a plus in that sense! I also use a [ZIG brand dual-tip writing pen] (https://image.ibb.co/gFnmqa/3supp3.jpg) for doodling and lining; I don't really like the thin end, as I'm rather heavy-handed and pressing too hard on that end causes a small amount of ink splatter, but the thick end is quite nice and produces dark, even lines. For securing things inside my journal, I use [any type of roll-on tape] (https://image.ibb.co/nfcVGF/3supp4.jpg). I don't really like this brand all that much, as it tends to clump up more often than it will actually stick to the page, but I bought a few refills for it when I initially bought it, so I'm stuck with it. My favorite roll-on tape would have to be the glue dot brand ones, I try to go for the thinner dots to avoid thick bumps on the pages I put things on. I also have [classic glue dots] (https://preview.ibb.co/ho283v/3supp5.jpg), which are a total need for me. I found that roll-on tape doesn't hold on to Polaroids very well, and glue dots were the perfect solution.Anyway, I should probably explain how I started. It was around the time that I'd gotten into high school, and I'd needed a place to store my thoughts that wasn't the corner of a math assignment. I'd always loved stationery, but never knew what to actually do with any of the pens and things I purchased. Eventually, I'd decided to give journaling a try after spending a few hours on my laptop looking through images of really pretty looking journals. I'll admit that I don't think my journals are too interesting to look at, but as I kept going, I adopted the mantra that a journal isn't about being pretty or mess-free. A journal is like a snapshot of you. A little peek into what you were like at a certain time in your life. Your thoughts, your struggles, your muses. With that in mind, journaling helped me through a lot of tough times that I'd never had friends to talk to for. It's not like I had a lot to worry about, in the eyes of anyone else, because I wasn't underprivileged, nor did I ever really worry about food or shelter. I, for all that anyone knew, was totally normal.  But when it came down to it, I had human struggles just like anyone else. Boy problems, family issues. Things you don't want to talk about to anyone, because half the time talking about them just made you seem dramatic as a young kid. Under the surface, though, I was suffering. It wasn't until my senior year of high school that I'd be diagnosed with a mental disorder that I've had to deal with unknowing up until that point. For every year prior to my diagnosis, I spent my days on the verge of suicide. I didn't have anyone to talk to, and I felt alone. But once I got a pen in my hand, and sat on my bed to write, it seemed like I would fall into my writing. I found myself smiling and able to forget the daily crap I shoveled through. So with that said, if you're reading this and you're struggling in one way or another, and you don't really know who to talk to, try storing your thoughts in a journal. It might help a lot.Entry examples:[[x]](https://image.ibb.co/c3Ko3v/4entry0.jpg)[[x]](https://image.ibb.co/hsucwF/4entry1.jpg)[[x]](https://image.ibb.co/j1WPbF/4entry2.jpg)[[x]](https://image.ibb.co/cQ0jbF/4entry3.jpg)[[x]](https://image.ibb.co/dpvviv/4entry4.jpg)[[x]](https://image.ibb.co/dyAT3v/4entry5.jpg)[[x]](https://image.ibb.co/k5sKAa/4entry6.jpg)[[x]](https://image.ibb.co/cVPo3v/4entry7.jpg)[[x]](https://image.ibb.co/fUdFiv/4entry8.jpg)[[x]](https://image.ibb.co/mffHwF/5entry1.jpg)[[x]](https://image.ibb.co/jP3Fiv/5entry2.jpg)[[x]](https://image.ibb.co/cMDsVa/5entry3.jpg)[[x]](https://image.ibb.co/gUuzAa/5entry4.jpg)Thanks for reading <3","0.2781341076","0.3166502714","0.0982179344"
"How to securely journal on a computer. 2017TLDR: Use [Veracrypt](https://veracrypt.codeplex.com/) to create an encrypted drive on a usb stick. Use [CherryTree](http://www.giuspen.com/cherrytree/#downl) (or [Zim](http://zim-wiki.org/) or [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/)) to create a journal file saved on the encrypted drive.       This is how I journal while at the office and at home. I have a standard desk job with a windows company computer.       First, download Veracrypt for your operating system. I'm on windows at work, and linux at home. I use veracrypt to create a 2 gig encrypted drive on my keychain usbstick. The trick is to have veracrypt installed on your computer, but pointing to the data file on your usb stick. Read the [manual](https://launchpadlibrarian.net/289850232/VeraCrypt%20User%20Guide.pdf) for details. When mounted, veracrypt creates a drive on your computer, like the C: drive. I use J: arbitrarily. Whatever OS you use, it can run a version of Veracrypt that will be able to open the data file on your usb stick.           Anything you store on this drive, when unmounted, is impossible for normal people, and very hard for professionals to get into. Perfect for private journal entries, pictures, or even work files.        Next, You can use your favorite note taking software, save it's data files on the encrypted drive and you're done. I use CherryTree because it is easy to add pictures to journal entries, and it works without lag on my usb 2.0 stick. I can't wait for my work computer to be upgraded to have usb 3.0. For speed, try to remember to have your note software installed on your computer system, but point to the data files on your usb encrypted drive. If you don't want to deal with the encrypted drive business, cherrytree does have a password lock you can turn on. I haven't played with it.General computer security tips:     Stop using the same password for everything. Grab [KeypassX](https://www.keepassx.org/), or any NON-internet based password program. Use generated passwords, unique to every website. At the very least use unique passwords for your bank, and email client. I store my KeypassX file on my usb stick and have it installed on my OS, pointing to the usb drive.     Please stop using Evernote. I'm not trusting anyone else but me with my journals.     If you want your company, ISP, and cellphone provider, to stop knowing your browsing habits, use a VPN. I use [AirVPN](https://airvpn.org/) for my work computer and iphone. Its only 50$ a year for peace of mind. (yes i know talented IT departments can still know what you're doing on a work computer, but honestly, most IT departments don't care).    Stop using Gchat and text messages. Grab [Signal](https://whispersystems.org/) for your phone and its [Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/signal-private-messenger/bikioccmkafdpakkkcpdbppfkghcmihk?hl=en).    Use incognito mode on your browser and clear your history. Ctrl+Shift+N on chrome.         Just because you have nothing to hide doesn't mean your boss or AT&T should have access to your diary or private conversations. This isn't paranoid, so much as locking your door.    I'd love to hear suggestions other people have for digitally journaling. ","0.1361329108","0.4572979212","0.1883122921"

"I started journaling about 3 months ago, and I've been really enjoying it so far. It helps me articulate my thoughts, and I think it has really been a benefit to my mental health as well. During the week I usually walk to a nearby wildlife preserve on my lunch break and write there. Just free form thoughts, describing what's happening around me, that sort of thing. But on the weekends, without that structure, I just can't seem to motivate myself to write. I tell myself ""I should write THIS weekend, I know it will be beneficial."", but by the end of the weekend it never seems to happen. Same goes for if I was planning to write more in the evening.

"Darling people of this beautiful subreddit,I, prone to seek control and uniformity due to my OCPD, keep running into the same exact problem: no matter which way I try to turn, I have a growing anxiety over the type of notebook that I use. I fell head over heels for a very large notebook and I'm currently halfway through my third. Yet, every now and then, I worry that the company will go out of business or stop production of this specific type. This led me to hand bind my own book, thinking I would have a standard setup for as long as I could make them. A couple weeks in, it feels silly not to have hundreds of pages available in my sturdy notebook, with the paper texture I love, and the cover that works for me. You might be thinking 'get over yourself', but I'd love to hear from people who have experienced this. Do you recognize this anxiety? Edit: I am especially curious because I notice it heavily influences my writing. I sometimes don't write for days on end because of this issue, and I really need writing to process and keep sane. (P.S.: as I'm writing this, the urge to go back to my familiar notebook is very strong, and I don't care what happens if the company stops production. I also know I'll start feeling doubtful in a few days time.)","0.0828964263","0.2068478316","0.1349507272"

I have been keeping many journals for different purposes and now more than ever I want that outlet for therapy.

"When I started journaling four months ago I told my wife that she could read it anytime, I didn't feel like I needed to hide anything from her. Since I started my writing has become very honest and I never really give much thought to what I write or who might read it. This morning my wife read my journal and read a few things that she really didn't like or find flattering. I'm not having an affair or anything of that nature, one of the things she read was that I was disappointed in her valentines day gift and that hurt her.So now, I don't really feel betrayed by her reading it, but I am unhappy about it since there are a lot of times I write about how wonderful she is and how much she means to me. I guess I'm feeling that I can't write honestly anymore, that everything I write will be subject to review, I'm feeling bad because she was hurt by something I wrote.Sorry to be a downer with this I was just wondering how the group has delt with this or if its an issue with anyone else. I don't want to hide things from her and I want to write honestly about things, I'm just not sure I can anymore.","0.0526568852","0.667637229","0.10990688950000001"

"Hey everyone, myself and the new mod team are in the works of making a featured Redditor for each week in 2017.  The idea behind this came from /u/meowwornever.  Where each week we ask one of you awesome journalers to share a bit about yourself, some photos, and answer some questions from the community.  Once we provide you with a prompt to fill out, we ask that its posted and we will sticky that post.  Then, for the next week you're our Famous featured journaler!  We hope this will help brighten up the discussion, as well as reduce aggression between people as we continue to grow in subscribers.This redditor who is chosen will of course come from the /r/Journaling community too.

"I keep a regular text journal, but have recently been trying to get into bullet journaling. I have a few lists, weekly pages, and daily pages. I see people on Tumblr mostly use weekly pages, so advice on how to fit all of my goals into a little day box is also appreciated. The main problem I have, though, is that it's so boring. I tried color coding my goals and tasks but it was still insanely boring. I can't doodle or draw at all. I have a pretty nice fountain pen but I can only do very basic italic calligraphy, and I usually don't even bother with that because I know it won't make much difference. It seems most the nice looking spreads combine calligraphy, doodles, and collage with a theme or color scheme. I'd really like to try and make it work because I love the idea, and it is much more helpful to me than a planner. I also think beautifying it would be some nice stress relief. Any advice from bujo people? Or even art journalists?Edit: Here are three examples of ones I like, if that helps. Links go directly to Tumblr.

"Most people here seem to use the ""Sephora"" of journaling equipment, but a lot of journaling enthusiasts probably can't afford to buy Midori or Moleskine notebooks, or fountain pens. I personally aspire to graduate to fancier notebooks and try out some fancier pens, but right now I have a couple tried-and-true products that work really well for me personally.I feel I can only really be comfortable in a journal if the notebook itself comes from the dollar bin at Michael's. This probably has something to do with the fact that my first journal came from there, but they often have a sizeable number of pages that each fit a comfortable number of words. I also like the spiral bindings, as they lay flat, and the non-spiral-bound ones are cheap enough that they can often be folded over and written on comfortably, as well.In terms of pens, I just use a ballpoint, black or blue ink. I also use the set of 12 Paper-Mate Flair felt-tip pens to track various topics and emotions.The main purpose of this post is to get a conversation going for those of us who aren't quite ready to shell out $27 for a notebook yet (hopefully someday).

"##Howdy everyone!!!##I wanted to answer a few more questions coming from our survey.## Someone asked who the ""mystery benefactor"" is that is benefiting from the affiliate links.  I supppose You can say I am.  My name is Andrew.  Hi.  But I haven't made much, Only enough to buy a single domain name.  Of which is related to journaling.  But I cant share it because atm it is linked to my real name and contact information lol. another person made the remark that the product page is a wall of text.  I agree.  Im brainstorming restructuring ideas at the moment. Someone told me the page feels as if Im pushing products.  In a way I am.  And maybe thats bad.  So I may be asking for product suggestions.  With this, Im planing on restructuring with a price range categorization. this should allow for the true idea of the page.  That its a way of sharing journaling products that we can get for cheaper than normal.  In addition to being a beginners guide.I also want to say that the headers are a bit similar in size, so Im going to do some work in the css to update the height of the # ## and ### headers.  Thanks! We have a really broad audience based on the second question Ive found.  And some of you awesome folk mentioned that the linked products dont ship to your country.  So My plan may end up where I have an international page in the bottom of the products page.  And that should link products for you. One user asked if there was a sponsorship going on between these companies.  Rest assured there is no money being handed off on either end.  In a few cases 3.  I""ve recieved a free journal from the producer of the product.  But i've never taken money.  I did ask for the journal.  The idea behind the page originally was to test each product and leave a review linked from the page for you all.  This is hard to do and iv'e dropped the idea and plan to give the 2 journals I never wrote in away, in the future.  I dont actually request a free journal anymore.  I just request the sellers permission to link their product and for the discount code.  Most of them say yes to being featured.... ;D someone said: ""The reason I don't post journal pics is because I would have to post them on imgur and the people on imgur leave the nastiest comments ever. is there any way we can host somewhere else? or are we allowed to?""  I want to say I know what you mean exactly.  those Fs lol.  You can still use imgur however, just dont post public, or you can delete your post from your public gallery.  And only submit the link from your album.  This way its private within our community. Other hosts are allowed however.  And ill notify you all if that changes ;D Pm me if anyone wants a bit of help :D #Thanks for the very positive feedback within the beginners guide section of the survey.  Im ecstatic to see that you want to make journaling fun and easy for everyone :DAnd based on your results so far. You've swayed my mind from making a website.  Instead, we will be keeping in on Reddit, the by far better option.  And I think thats for the better ;DLastly to the person who said this :> I find it a little odd how the main mod feels like this is 'their' subreddit.

"I saw the bullet journal system and thought it was cool because I never thought about organizing my journal before. However, I felt like the system could be reduced further. They put a lot of emphasis on their scheduling and calendar system in the tutorial which for me makes everything feel less flexible. It also does not work well for people already in the middle of filling a previous journal.I wanted a system that would be ultra simple, ultra flexable and adapt well to journals that have already been written in. I decided to do something that I call Index Journaling. All you have to do is index the journal entries that you feel need to be indexed. If you want to have a calendar or anything else you can create one wherever you want and just index it. If you want to do something like keep track of all your to do lists or all entries relating to a topic you can create a topic specific sub-index and write what page it is on in the main index. I personally have my main index starting on the last page that way I don't have to worry about running out of index space but If you wanted to you could put in the front and save a couple of pages for indexing.I found that this works for me but if anyone else has their own custom journal organization system I would love to hear about it.

"Ok, this may sound lame, but I've been racking my brain over this for some days now and have no one to discuss it with because no one else I know is as obsessed with recording as I am. I write every day in a diary. It's actually a date book in which instead of writing what I will do, I write down what I did every day, as well as any reflections on the day's events. I also have a more intimate diary where I expand any topic I feel I need to write more about after jotting down the day's events. This one I don't use every day, though. In addition to this, I have a regular notebook where I write first drafts, make lists of projects and such. Some of my writings here are autobiographical, but not very intimate, as the diary is. The conundrum is this: I'm starting the year with one of those ""a-prompt-a-day"" lists. Many of the prompts are autobiographical, but they're exercises, not diary entries, although they will be dated every day. So I plan to use a regular notebook for this. Now, as I mentioned, I have a regular notebook already started. Should I do these exercises in the one I have already started or should I start a new one dedicated just for 2017? I don't want the notebook to suddenly have a new project starting in the middle, especially if the exercises are going to be dated and I'll probably have to continue in another notebook, but at the same time I hate to start a new notebook when there's one unfinished.

I love the different journals I've seen on the wall at Barnes and Noble and the different ways journals have been personalized by people.  I love the ability to keep mementos and other physical things in a book like newspaper clippings.  I even love the act of writing with a pen (I use a Pilot G-2 07).  I love using my phone app Journey for journaling.  I can take pictures and video and audio and add them to the journal entry.  It keeps track of date and time, weather, exact location with tags and current activity. I can export it and print it.  I've been torn on how to journal.

I will write in my journal every night, or throughout the day if I am able, and if I am not able to write I will use my Journey app to record what is going on.  When it gets to be full enough I will figure out how to back it up and print it and put it in a binder or some other form of storage and keep with my books I write in.

"#Howdy everyone/u/revolution486 back at it again with the white vans... I mean... uh hi.###So today I wanted to share with you all a really cool notebook that was introduced to me via this subreddit.  Someone here had mentioned that they wanted to see kick-starter products in our product page.  They also said how they were interested in the notebook below and then linked me too them!So with Reddit in mind, I reached out to Rocketbook and asked them a bit about the product lines and how they worked.  One of their reps was happy to contact me back and even went to sending me one of the waves to test out. If you're not firmilliar with their products.  They are the producers of the ""wave"" notebook.  Which is a notebook that uses ""smart"" tech to store your entries into the cloud, aswell as allow you to completely wipe your notebook by microwaving it. #What they say about the notebook!I figured it fair to share what they say about their book, then I will include what I feel about it.So Kim, the representative that I got to chat with had told me about their product and basically shared with me everything it can do.  It is cloud-compatible with a number of great apps, including Slack, Dropbox, Google Drive, Evernote, iCloud and Box. Pages can also be e-mailed. However, unlike the Moleskine smart book, it is completely unplugged, and does not require a Bluetooth device when writing.   Lastly, kim linked me with [This video](https://teamboard.wistia.com/medias/z9pr5muepw) to share.  It is an outline of how to use the journal.  #My Review, & What will I do with it?###So unlike any other journal out there, this one is temporary, but only If you want it to be...  Of-course you could never microwave it to clear it off, But thats not as fun :D###So I did a bit of pondering about it, and I have an idea.  For myself, I plan to use this as a daily planner for my workouts.  The reasoning behind this is that I can (after a workout is finished) write down what I did, times, and steps taken to do it.  Really anything related to my workout.  And I can keep doing this front to back.  Once i've filled the book from front to back.  Then I simply erase the notebook and start over.  Bear in mind, this is an 80 page book.  So if I divide each page into 3 or 4 parts I can almost fit an entire year of workouts in it.  Here are some photos of my book so far with some tests of writing: http://imgur.com/gallery/695wuAnd my oops when I used the wrong pen... ug... http://imgur.com/a/28lh2Here is the file sent to my google drive:https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3gGz8XhVgu2dTVjaHVWbi1waUE/view?usp=sharingI think it works by taking the snapshot, and cranking up the volumes of the colors to make it easy to read?  Not exactly sure on the tech part.  However, there is a problem.  What if I want to go back and view the notes I've taken.  They are gone.  Well they solved this with the app i've linked.  The app allows you to send each page to a cloud service.  You have up to 7 different options to choose from.  Which is chosen by X'ing out one of the 7 circled items at the bottom of each page.  Then, using the app you take a photo and the qr code on each page registers.  The magic happens and moments later you got your emails, or file transfers.  ###All in all, my honest opinion about this journal, without having erased it yet, is that its worth the money.  Its got what you need in a good journal.  Paper, and a binding.  (made of plastic by the way).  Its also got many uses, work & play, which are a plus to me.  I however dont see myself keeping a daily entry journal in this, Unless however I used the app to keep each page on the google drive account.  I suppose I could also do both.  And have my workouts go to my google drive in one folder, and my Journal entries go into the other.Hopefully this helps you all make your choices!I cant completely see everyone in the world using this notebook.  However, it fits my needs perfectly.  And I want another-one already!  If you dont know, Im a cook and go to culinary school.  This would be useful to take my notes and then wipe them clean each semesters end.##speaking of wiping clean...I want to plug their Everlast line.  Its the one Im really interested in, because of the versatility it provides.  The Everlast, also linked above, allows you to erase each page written with most pens.  And just with a pen and cloth.  Basically its a more mobile version of this book.  I would only be afraid of spills of water erasing the pages.  However, I will have to see the product before I can judge it that way ;D#Here are all the important links for you!##You can also find the journal in our products page ;D You can buy your own Rocketbook Wave here: [Affiliate link via amazon](http://amzn.to/2iVUY9b) - [Rocketbooks Site](https://getrocketbook.com/products/rocketbook-wave) - $27.00 You can find the app used with this journal here: https://getrocketbook.com/pages/learn-moreI also want to mention how the wave is not their only product for sale.

"Hey all, I want to see if anyone else faces this dilemma.I love writing my ideas, observations, analyses in journals. Or rather, I love the idea of it. Unfortunately, I find myself jumping to notes on my phone and just jotting it down there (or even sometime as a voice recording), and as a result it's taking me nearly two years to fill one journal when it could've been less than one. Going back and copying something in my phone down in long hand seems like a silly chore. The reality is I struggle to find a definitive reason to write many things by hand that are initially natural to do digitally, but yet I love it when I do it and I love the idea of it. I just need some examples of how to use a journal in a way that is actually best done in a journal and not in any other way. Please help! Even if you just tell me how you use yours, maybe I can do the same as a separate endeavor. ","0.0740448087","0.3188034892","0.3811288178"
"I journaled a lot in 1989-1990 when I was an exchange student, then off and off (not much on lol) over the next couple decades.  I've had laptops for a few years and have kept a hodge-podge of different Word documents or Google docs writings but nothing organized.  I decided in July 2008 to start a written journal.  I'm now 52 pages into.  In 8 and a half years. lol  It's hard back and hard to write in because of the spine, my handwriting sucks.  I've used the Journey app on my android phone and Google Chrome off and on and really like it because I can add pics to it straight from my phone camera or choose them from a file.Then I find this sub and see these cool journals that everyone has written in, and I want to be like the cool, dedicated kids! lol  My handwriting may suck, I know I need a journal that is not hard back so it will lay flat so I can write better, and the stuff that I have read from this sub make me want to stick to writing and not typing.  Even though typing is so much easier.  Not questions, just glad I found you all and could explain (probably not so well) how I was feeling about journaling.

We wanted to easily identify trends in mood, and build up your personal list of Aha moments we call insights that, over time, become your own private Dalai Lama.Rather than submit our baby to open BETA we decided we would try and build a small community of testers who already understand the value of journalling.If you have an iPhone and can spare some time to give us feedback wed love to hear from you.

"I'm thinking of starting a daily journal on January 1st and I want to do it by hand, it doesn't feel the same when writing on a computer, but I have a problem, I am very, very prone to formatting my texts and I don't feel like this habit will be a good combination with hand writing. I also tend to forget to type out words so usually if I type for 5 minutes straight I will almost always have missed a few words. Example would be something like ""I to the store to buy flour."", I could continue typing after this and have no idea I didn't type out ""went"" in that sentence. Is this something that is less prone to happen when you write by hand?I feel like this will be a major problem for me since it's kind of difficult to format something that's written by hand, I plan on writing in pencil so I will be able to erase stuff, but if I forget a word and then write 10 more sentences I can't just erase all that for one word. I also feel like my entries will be worse if I write them by hand since I can't edit the text and add stuff to make it perfect, if I'm writing an essay I always spend about 1/3 of the time just going back rewriting, adding words, adding spaces and changing the position of sentences to where they fit better.Do these problems tend to go away after a while?

In 2010!There are actually quite a few pages of entries, and somehow my handwriting was much better back then.  One entry is particularly embarrassing, and I read it out to my wife.  She had a good laugh at my expense. There were others that were fascinating to read as they were leading up to our buying a house together.  I didn't really understand normal romantic interactions back then so it was really funny to see how absolutely thick I was about why my girlfriend would possibly want to wear my clothes, and why she kept leaving things in my room.So now my entries are updates about what happened in the last few years, which is funny, because I started and finished another few journals between then and now.

"Hello journalers, in recent years I seem to have lost the spark for writing and I was wondering if anyone else has ever felt the same. Between the ages of 9 to 17 I journaled fairly regularly, then quit after someone read my journal without permission (without going into details, it was pretty traumatic at the time). In college I tried to pick the habit back up, and even filled up a whole journal, but it wasn't the same as before. I just feel embarrassed to write about myself. It feels unnecessarily self-absorbed and indulgent. After graduating from college, I stopped journaling entirely. Maybe it's just a personality thing or a part of getting older? I'm 24 now and the older I've gotten, the less I like any kind of emotional display, both in real life and in art/music/books. It feels (to use the word again) embarrassing, like oversharing. The introspective aspect of journaling bothers me too. Spending time writing about myself feels immature and unproductive. These are just my personal hangups - I'm not judging journaling in general; I think it's a good habit with a lot of potential benefits. But I'm wondering if anyone else has ever gone cold on journaling after writing avidly for years, and, if so, how you got past it. I'd like to get my habit back, but these days I just can't seem to enjoy it much.(...yes, I see the irony in writing this post all about my feelings on journaling, heheh :) )","0.09868945180000001","0.4257494807","0.3225685954"
"So I've been journaling for about a year now, and find it an extremely important part of my day. I lead a pretty weird and crazy life at times, and capturing those moments has proven to be a lot of fun, and quite frankly, almost life affirming at times. Currently I use Field Notes for my daily journal logs, and a Hobonichi Techo to provide a bullet journal style look at my day, tasks, events and random thoughts. I often stick movie tickets, cards from cafes I visit etc into the Hobonichi. Right now I usually do this - record the day in the Hobonichi as a bullet, and then expand on those events and thoughts at night when I sit down with my Field Notes. So far, this has been a good system.But the problem is there are so many nice notebooks out there that I haven't tried. My girlfriend just bought me a Daycraft notebook that I am going to use for my creative work stuff, and it feels so nice. She also bought me a Nuuna Inspiration Book for similar activities. Now I'm going to be carrying several books around for different things, but just holding these books has me wondering.Should I explore other notebooks? Should I take 2017 as an opportunity to mix in other pocket sized or smaller notebooks into my rotation to create a box of books that are all different? I enjoyed the uniformity of my Field Notes collection, all with their different covers etc. What do you guys do? Any advice out there? If it helps, I write with a fountain pen, so paper bleed is an important factor.  ","0.3135482073","0.1287942827","0.0502466559"

"#Howdy everyone!  I wanted to bring up a few responses I received from the survey.So far, the survey is doing just what I needed it to do.  Introduce me to you're expectations!  However there were a few responses that are completely warranted.  SO thanks for those of you who asked them.Here is my quick reply to a few of the responses.##Q: What is the reasoning behind the prohibition on posting published journals?##A: I had a select few redditors constantly posting kenyan medical journals.  By published journals this is what i had in mind.  Journals that were of that nature.##Q: Just hoping the subreddit doesn't start to take journaling TOO seriously and has fun with the product lines, etc.##A: I dont know about the rest of you, but i've been crushing up journals i've written on and injecting them into my blood for the past year.  I feel that it gives me some great ideas.  Removes writers block ;D##Q: It's really cool to see a mod be so active in making their subreddit better (making the decision to close /r/journal and move on over to /r/journaling)##A: Its not a question, and i suppose this isn't the answer lol.  But I also chose to leave moderating of /r/oddlysatisfying so I could put more effort into here ;D##Q: This survey's results might be skewed due to the US only restriction.##A: Please pm me, I wasnt aware that this is us only?  I've gotten some submissions from other countries.  Or so the submitted answers have said.##Q: No other moderators for checks and balances. Makes me distrust the affiliate links.##A: I can completely understand the distrust.  That is why where applicable i've included the non affiliate links.  I would prefer you make the decision to trust whether I am worthy of any money brought in.  And if you feel the slightest hint that im not behing honest about the program.  Please just use the non affiliate links or dont use them at all.##Q: more resources for first-time journalers##A:The purpose of this survey is in part to create a large DB on which I can learn what is genearally wanted for experienced journalers, aswell as in-experienced.  I'd like to convert this into its own wiki page.  #The big one##Q: Needs more transparency on how the affiliate earnings are used. ##A: I totally agree.  So now although I haven't made a game plan to break it down by percentages.  I have decided to first take out the $ for shipping costs.  Whatever is left can be saved.  I am hoping that by mid summer of 2017 or hopefully earlier I can  purchase our own domain and start a journaling website!  Im open to suggestions.The end game goal is to comprise all the data I've recovered into a journaling website.  This way we can connect the subreddit outside of Reddit.

"##Hey everyone your favorite person /u/revolution486 here today :D  ###Today after another hard day at work in the kitchens, I was able to come home and find a package in the mailbox.  What was the package you ask?  Well... Let me tell you!So the package was the ""Full Grain Leather Composition Cover Journal for Field Notes"".  I chose the Vintage brown one by the way.  [Here is the ""notebook"" for my, New notebook day!!!](http://imgur.com/gallery/6C3zv)So if you would like to buy one for yourself you can do so here: Full Grain Leather Coposition Cover - Jackson Wayne - [Affiliate Link](http://amzn.to/2hIQJdC) - [Non-Affiliate Link](https://www.amazon.com/Leather-Composition-Journal-Notebooks-Saddle/dp/B01G97CR30/ref=sr_1_15?s=office-products&ie=UTF8&qid=1481961547&sr=1-15&keywords=Field+Notes) - $59.00##My Review###With the 2 Hours that i've had to use the notebook i've been pleased very much so.  As the card states.  It is a bit stiff, and im sure it will be until I really get to using it.  However thats alright in my situation.###There were quite a few things I liked about this journal.  For instance.  It has the option to hold some credit cards, and a pen.  As well as the journal.  Also a bonus for me, they sent the cover with an empty journal.  The Field Notes book to be exact.  However you can defiantly put another notebook inside.  A Rite in the Rain book perhaps?  In addition to the actual book I was pleasantly delighted to a Thank You card.  Hand signed by the CEO Andrew L.  So that was cool.  All in all I like it.  There wasn't much to not like.  Its a simple, elegant, & BEAUTIFUL, case to convert a booring Field Notes to a stunning collection Piece.  So Im happy to have one in my arsenal of journals.I want to bring up two points about this cover however.  1.) If you plan to keep this with you as you travel by foot, then you're in luck.  There is a handy slot to keep your credit card sized objects in. I think this is a cool feature and a great idea of what to do with the blank space on the cover side.  But, I cant see myself ever wanting to put credit cards or even an ID inside the slots.  I would be too frightened to have just that slight chance of it being stolen/ lost and I dont ever get those cards back.  In addition to not getting the journal back.Of course... This can be stopped by not using these card slots.  Or by using a card that is easy to cancel.  Or if you just dont care and want to store your ID then it works great!2.) My second issue with this journal was the space for a pen.   Or more properly called, the pen/ pencil loop?  The little loop inside the cover is... well just that... Little.  I could just maybe get my Vac 700 or 580AL inside it if I forced it.  However I wont do that because Im afraid to damage it.I did notice that there was quite an overlap of extra leather for this loop.  Possibly someone can enlarge it if they know how?  I dont see why not atleast.###So I suppose I should offer a recap.  All in all.  I completely suggest using this for anyone interested in travel journaling.  Or Daily note taking.  As the Field Notes brand would imply.  More specifically though.  Anyone who is interested in the Field Notes Notebooks.  And may have some already I would again, totally say pick one of these little buggers up!  They are cool and sleek.  I probably should mention you dont have to get the color I got :D  I just like dark leathers.  There is also a lighter, tan version.  And a black one.Hopefully this helps someone out if they chose to read all of this ;DFull disclosure - I got this notebook as a gift from their CEO so that I can decide whether or not it would be worth the time to introduce it all too you!","0.3850567937","0.2376563102","0.1401475072"

"My girlfriend and I are in a long distance relationship. We find journaling to each other to be a vital part in our communication and a raw expression of our emotions and what we are going through. Well we have amassed quite the record of them, but going back through them on our smart phones isn't that special and doesn't bring back the full breadth of feelings they elicited when first received. So I am printing them all out and I want to compile them in a journal. My plan is to attach envelopes to the pages and have the entries inside. I'll include pictures and snippets of our texts and conversations throughout as well. I also want to incorporate some collages. I am reaching out to you guys in hopes of giving me more ideas to personalize this journal and make it truly special for her.

Every single one save for the last set were terrible looking flowery tween journals (that I don't even think tweens want) that my grandparents kept buying for my little sister.  I just didn't want to waste.  Because of that I have had no issue destroying them during use.  I covered the first one in Hot topic stickers and black markers (SUPER ANGST RIDDEN EDGY TEEN), tore out pages on some, I mean I really wrecked a few.I bought the new ones before starting my current journal.My current one is nice.  Wife's parents buy her very nice gender neutral ones, but she doesn't use them, so they're mine!Now though?  I am on the last few pages of the last one in-laws gave to wife.  The next one will be the one I bought.  For me.I feel like I'm not worthy of these one's somehow.  Not in a romantic or flowery way.  I literally feel like they're too nice to write in.  I picked out exactly what I wanted.  Now I can't make myself use them.Is this a relatable this experience?","0.15816986560000001","0.4577386081","0.2157054096"

"I started journaling when I was young, like 12 or 13.  I was pretty reliable at it for a long time.  Then you know high school and college, then kids.  I recently got back into it.  Got myself a new journal, a new fountain pen and have been doing pretty good for several months.  My only issue is that when the journal is opened, the way the binding rolls the left hand page makes it very hard to write, let alone write legibly(which is its own challenge for me).  So I got to thinking that maybe a loose leaf journal was the way to go.  I had a quick peak online and all I could find was effectively ring binders.  I was wondering if anyone had any suggestions on a nice loose leaf journal that isnt basically a binder.","0.10876753930000001","0.4294060469","0.2543673217"

"I am soon to depart on a trip where I'll be gone for an extended amount of time. I don't have many possessions I give a shit about besides my journals, and right now there's a suitcase filled with about 20 of them.Before I go, I need to preserve the journals and then burn the physical copies because if anybody saw these, I'd kill myself. What is going to be the best way to do this? Digitizing comes to mind, but the thought of the data leaking or getting hacked terrifies me. The two options within the digitization possibility that have occurred to me are either taking pictures of each page or typing each journal up into its own text file.Which is going to be the better of these options? How do I do this with utterly no risk of the information falling into the hands of someone besides myself? Storing the information on a server seems out of the question, but maybe I'm wrong. Maybe my only option is a flash drive with a password on it that I take with me and a duplicate that I leave in a safety deposit box with a password on it.Any advice is greatly appreciated.","0.09228630360000001","0.2687603831","0.3900476396"
"I've been journaling on and off for the last few years but it has gotten more serious and I have written about each and every day since the start of 2015. In the past 4 or 5 years, the longest I've gone without journaling is maybe 3 weeks. It is extremely important to me and it's something that I definitely want to keep up for a variety of reasons but it has gotten to the point of it being obsessive and it makes me anxious if I don't write enough each day. I want to change how I journal for 2017 so that I am still writing everyday but in a more structured way that allows me to get down everything I want to record but also limits how much I write. I write on a word document and have been for a while since I write too much to handwrite (I went back to handwritten journals in 2015 but it was too much work to keep up because of how much I write). To give an idea of how much I'm writing, my word document for November 2016 is single spaced 150 pages and 127,260 words. It's ridiculous and kind of takes over my life. I want something simple but guided and focused. Are there specific questions or things like that that you guys use to focus your writing? Also for those of you who use multiple kinds of journals at the same time, how does that work for you? I'm very religious so I have a hand written prayer journal in addition to my typed journal but I'd also like to start another kind of journal that I write in French (fluent second language). Any and all advice is appreciated! As a sidenote: does anyone else struggle with writing too much? It's out of control and it actually does really interfere with my life as I'm spending too much time writing in my journal and not enough time actually living my life. For those who don't struggle with this, how do you justify (for lack of a better word) taking a significant amount of time out of your day to journal? I'm starting to think it's a waste of time when I think of the hundreds of hours I spend but at the same time I think the benefits are enormous and I don't see myself ever stopping so it kind of puts me in this weird internal conflict.

"Like you all, I want to keep a diary/journal, just for the small things that happen in life.I understand and respect the face that people do it by writing it down physcially, and maybe down the line I will too - but for now I would like to use digital journal-taking.It seems that there is no App that has the following features:- Cross Platform: Why should I worry about technological ecosystem when all I want to do is log my thoughts?- Custom Sync and Backup: I dont really want to use a sync system from a specific company just for my journal, especially not one that is proprietary. I want to be able to use Dropbox/OneDrive/GoogleDrive etc- Minimal Interface: I dont really have an issue with some of the apps out there in this regard, they seem to nail this bit- Good Export Settings: This too, is handled pretty well. Along with Sync, it would be nice to have a manual PDF backup once a year maybe.Now my question is this. Even if it were paid, I am sure that a LOT of people would buy such a product. I want a program/app where I can start writing about my day on my iPhone, then continue it later on my Windows 10 machine. Or one that I start writing on my Pixel and continue on my Macbook.I have only seen one app with this type of wide-ranging cross platform reach, and that is Wunderlist, they really want to be out there on every platform, and honestly its amazing.I do understand that Wunderlist is now owned by Microsoft, and that it must be why they have such a wide reach - but it seems like such an obvious gap in the market that Im frustratingly amazed how noone has tried to fill it yet.Does anyone have any suggestions?

I used my Pilot Metro with a fine nib and got no ghosting, which I was really impressed by!cheapCons:soft cover. I didn't realize how big of a deal breaker a soft cover would be for me but it quickly got annoying to have to find a book to wedge under it. Sure, I could write at a desk but sometimes the bed is too darn appealing.the paper seems to take a super long time to absorb the ink which inevitably lead to smudging. By super long time I obviously mean only a few seconds, but having to wait to move your hand is annoying when you write so much.Final thoughts: While the paper is pretty there is nothing terribly special about this notebook that would make me want to buy another one.","0.07774876060000001","0.0930853188","0.6204186082"
"#Howdy there Journalers.  Im here with another update for our community.If you have not noticed yet, there has been a button within our sidebar that is called the ""Products"" button.  The page has been empty, but I was able to get into contact today with someone and we've added the first product.  A journal from the company - wanderers away.####Anyways, the idea of this wiki page is to have a mass collection of discounted journal products.  All I ask of you journalers is to help me fill this page with products and ideally the company that sells them as well. To do this I could use the following## I will now ask that you use the comments below to share: 1 product you've used. 1 Product you want to try. 1 product that looks interesting too you.if you have more please share them (Including the selling company)The idea behind this engagement post is that for each product Ill be able to do some research and contact the seller.  Ill then ask what they can provide for our community within the realm of a Reddit discount.afterwords I can currate it all within that page in an easy to read format.  You may notice that the current link is an affiliate link.  I opted to include these linking options for all possible products so that I can use any small profits to cover the cost of shipping for our monthly giveaways.  I hope you can all understand.#Lastly, if you have any questions/ comments/ concerns please message me or click the message the mods button!Thanks!edit: I wanted to include that if you have a product you would like to get on this page you're more than welcome to contact me or /u/Journalingbot and leave your request.

[Pic](http://i.imgur.com/uKLXDk5.jpg)I used it to religiously track the amount of time I spent babysitting my younger siblings - usually between 15 to 30 hours a week - as well as the amount of money my parents gave me for it (usually none, which was the point of the journal - to showcase how much they took me for granted. I was salty!). The dates run from 10/10/2005 to 7/28/2006 and it's the only item I've kept from that time period.

"Hi - my name is Alex and I've had an idea I haven't been able to get out of my mind for a while. I use to journal a ton in middle / high school and then early on in college. Since then, I've always tried to get back into it but it's hard - it's never convenient, it's difficult to make into a habit, and it's requires a lot of effort, no matter if you use an app, physical journal, or plain text doc. So for a while now I've thinking - ""what would be the easiest way to journal?"" and it occurred to me - texting! I'm in my messaging inbox all day, it would be natural if I could have a conversation with my journal.So that's why I made JournalBot - a conversational journal. It's very basic and very dumb - it'll text you a reminder every day and you just text it back.

"Hello, so not very long ago I started journaling. And one of my main goals, is to improve my writing and communication skills.For the most part, I'm writing about some of my past events expecting that there will be a ""reader"" (just me, as there are very personal things in it). So I'd usually try to fix any grammar errors, replace repetitive words, etc...And then, daily entries, with a more ""relaxed"" and straight writing. Not caring about the grammars as much as the ""story entries"".So my question is, will just keep writing everyday really improve it? Sure, if I do it everyday, I'll eventually get better. But this seems to be a rather ""passive"" improvement, and might take a long time before I can notice any difference.Any advice on how I can improve it more ""actively""?Thank you!","0.2435462475","0.13354451950000001","0.4439424872"

I like to write about special events in detail like trips, parties or just about overwhelming emotions consuming me at a particular moment. However, I now find myself struggling to write in detail like I used to because I have so much work to do. I tried typing my journal entry and I managed to put down even more details but it doesn't feel the same. And there's the risk of someone stumbling into it by some miraculous chance.

"This is happened to me today, thought I'd share. I talked for awhile with a homeless man today on the bus. He said he hadnt eaten since Friday, but refused when I offered him some of the beef jerkey I had bought for myself later. He reasoned ""I've never eaten that stuff, Man"". This guy was apparently from Jersey, he said he walked his way here to Southern California and then down into mexico, getting back without a hassle.He went on and on about how the military was starving him, so he was telling everybody on the bus but he couldnt tell anybody EXACTLY what he was doing because, well, that's classified. He went on about black diamonds that prevail in every aspect of our soceity, born into play generations ago and dominating today. He spoke of God, of understanding, and of everybody getting the 'green light' in his eyes. He said I had the same eyes as the girl who sat near him before me, the eyes of somebody compartmentalizing their emotion. From then on I was grasping at his every word, struggling to make out his erratic analogies and metaphors over the hum of the bus because that accusation rang true within me somewhere, and in the eyes of people I had seen too. I asked him where he was going and his reply was ""I just want to go somewhere I can plant myself so I can know nothing and be nothing"".

"Hello dear journaling experts!I've never kept a journal for longer than 2 weeks in my life, but I've recently seen a lot of youtube videos (yes I know, not the most reliable sources, but hey these guys speak from experience!) about the benefits of journaling and now I really want to get into it. I'd like to journal about my feelings and how I experience things that are going on in my life. For a while there has been a big dark cloud over my life and I really want to reflect about this. But whenever I try to sit down and journal about it, I feel the urge to explain the whole situation 'to the notebook' so to say. This would probably fill a whole notebook itself and so I just get discouraged and decide not to write anything at all. I just don't know where to start and I'm also afraid that by revisiting episodes that have already passed I will get depressed (no, I don't have depressions) and sad about it all over again and scratch open old wounds.

"So I have been going back through my journals to make sure they were all dated (Um they weren't, fun work for me.) and while I worked I read past entrees. I'm posting this for two reasons. 1) to encourage those new to journaling to keep on trekking. That this journey is worth the time and effort you will put into it. 2) Those that have been journaling for a few years, I encourage you to look through your journals and and check out the changes in your own emotional & mental growth, plus any changes in writing style. Names have been changed.My first journal, 15 years ago (2001) I called my Whatever book. ""I like Michael Carter. But Pria gave him a note. He believes what she said. Which is true.But still how could she DO THAT. He thinks I'm way weird. He used to like Kaitlyn but she said no way. Now all michael does is is look at me weird. OH NO!"" - I obviously had drama queen down. and was writing down info that had nothing to do with my emotions. But whatever. I was 12. And this is funny shit looking back on. That Pria girl was my best friend and we still talk.In a journal from my senior year, I let one of my friends read through it. I told her I didn't care but if she read something about her she couldn't get mad. She wrote comments. It's important to note that this friend and I had a MAJOR falling out. Like to this day I have nightmares about her. but when I read these comments. I laugh genuinely. I can hear her voice from 12th grade, when things weren't painful, and I grin. Most people aren't into letting others read their journals.

"TL;DR: Forgive me the novel. SO read my longest running journal. It has had a rather paralyzing affect. As the title says, I just need to vent. I've been journaling for about 20 years. It started when I was a wee child, and since I was home schooled, it provided a much needed place of solitude and reflection, away from my family (with whom I spent 24 figurative hours a day). As time progressed, my journals became an even more valuable place after I was diagnosed with moderate bi-polar disorder and depression. They became the repository for my darkest thoughts and the pain of my black dog. About 7 years ago, I was still living at home, and my Mother, bless her heart, read my journal cover to cover. She did this without my knowledge or permission; as such it violated my trust in her in a huge way. Since that time, I've zealously guarded my journal, as if it were some sacrosanct relic. Notwithstanding, I've let one friend read a few selected pages, in an effort to show how my mind works, but except for those occasions, nobody has been allowed to read it. Cut to three weeks ago, my SO of two and a half years read the journal that I have been writing in for the last 8 years (yes, it's the same journal that my Mom read). I feel hopelessly betrayed, and I don't know how to deal with this. I feel that my mental state compromises my objectivity on how to deal with it emotionally, so I've just shut it out completely. Yet, I am painfully aware, in the dark, quiet hours of the morning that the sanctity of my mind has been violated. My journal has been, as much as I hate to say, my safest place. I can be alone with my hopes, dreams, demons, and memories without the noise of my mental illnesses or my life affecting me. I simply don't know what to do. I'm incredibly introverted, and now one of my greatest outlets has been cut off. I've ordered a new, custom journal that should provide more security, but am I wrong to think that something (that I have told him is incredibly private and important to me) has been irreparably violated? The entire ritual I do in writing in my journal now seems trivial and common, which is something I bitterly resent. That ritual was calming to my mind. There has been research on the causes and effects of breaking into an SO's cellphone, but precious little about journals, so I have no empirical basis upon which to form a reaction, much less an opinion. I'm sure I sound somewhat odd, but emoting is something I do carefully. I'm curious if anyone has had similar experiences, but I realize how personal journaling is; obviously don't feel obligated (like the internet has a problem with that). So there you go.

"Okay, back story.I started journalling almost every day back in 2014, and I've written in the same journal for two years now (my handwriting is microscopic). I'm about 5 pages away from finishing the journal, and I wanted to have it done by this time, but I still haven't. I just started college, so thst may be the reason as to why I've pretty much taken a break.But the issue is that I really want to journal, even if I don't have the inspiration for it, because if I don't then I know that  someday I'm going to regret not documenting this time of my life and the thoughts and feelings. More importantly, I really want to get this journal finished, because it's pretty beat up as is and I want to just put it to rest already and begin a new book for this new chapter of my life.

"Hey guys! Ive only recently started journaling and I am a book old but the amount of good it has done to me to come out of depression is astounding. But I came across an article describing 3rd person journaling and its benefits. I tried it for a few days but I DON'T seem to be able to TRANSLATE the same depth of emotions as i did with first person journaling.I understand that there are benefits to 3rd person journaling but I would really like to capture my emotions too.

So I'm asking opinions and advice from you journaling community as to what point of view ya'll take.Also- I have had this long standing doubt. Do we read the entry immediately after we have written it down? I have never.

"I'm in my mid 20s and realized I'm not where I want to be. To help me through this, at the beginning of this year I decided I wanted to try to keep a journal. I quickly discovered I hate stream of consciousness journaling and wanted a more focused approach. I bought a chapter moleskine and instantly wrote down 10 things I wanted. Long term goals, short term, frivolous things, etc. I then labeled the chapters to help me write about these 10 things. My prompts (chapters)1. Stars - any and all goals, aka, what do I want?2. Steps - what are the traditional steps to getting these things?3. Timelines - when do you want to achieve this? A great way to force yourself to take action.4. Distractions - why haven't you done these things yet? (no money, scared to start, previous failures, have to switch careers)5. Thoughts - a quick check in with myself about how I felt going through the first 4 prompts. 6. Save - all my goals required money, I used this as an opportunity to see how much money I could save and to document how I did it.7. Why - why I picked my goals and reflections on the progress I made toward them since I began the journalThis journal took me closer to 12 weeks to fill out instead of the 7 I originally planned, but it's helped me a lot. I feel like I'm taking the right steps to reach my goals. I really like that I can view how I did it, what I was thinking, and even what my fears were. Very therapeutic and an encouraging way to get started (for me).TL;DR: I hate stream of consciousness journaling and started a journal to help me focus on my goals. I achieved my goals or have gotten to a better place. Do you use your journals for specific topics? How do you choose a new topic for your next journal?

"seen in the Orlando SentinelDiaries are supposed to be private. Yet Orlando Cringe is a place for people to read their diaries in a room full of strangers. Anything from high school crushes, first kisses, fights between friends, and teenage angst, are unabashedly shared through a microphone on stage. Founder of Orlando Cringe, Darren Wendroff, says its a pretty interesting process, like therapy in a way. Anyone can submit a piece of writing from a diary. The magic happens when readers divulge what was happening in their lives at the time it was written. When we announced it, we expected 20 or so people, Wendroff said. Within 3 days of creating a Facebook event for their first show, 150 people registered to attend. Ultimately they acquired a larger venue for their growing audience.

"For the past a couple of years, I have been trying to implement journaling into my life. It has been pretty hard to make it into a habit. I know the benefits of it, and I know that it keeps me focused on my goals in life.&nbsp;During a long weekend, I had a lot of time on my hands, so I created a bot that would call me every day at a certain time, so I can reflect on my day without the need of remembering it. It has been by far the easiest solution I have found to journaling. All the files are saved so I can go back and listen to my recordings or just read through a transcribed version.&nbsp;Let me know if you guys are interested in adding something similar to your life.

The pro's of analog journaling however are that I can mix in bullet journal style elements such as Books to Read pages and monthly calendars, greater personalization, the physical record, and being able to doodle/be more creative in general.Would you say it's better to spend a month doing both digital and analog every day and then comparing at the end?

"It feels so much better without using facebook. Indeed it is a great site to help you reconnect with a few old high school friends, show off some things but at the end of the day you learn that its really about talking to that person face to face or on the contrary talking with that person on the phone about everyday life events such as politics, philosphy, movies, music, and old stories and just what you have been up to.

"I'll preface this by saying that this isn't, honestly, a cry for help. I'm just hoping that it may be helpful in some way- to someone who can relate and not feel so alone, or for anyone who is lucky enough to not have felt this way to understand a little better what others go through. It was something of a journal entry written at a low point.  A bit painful to reread, but maybe some good can come of it.""Contrary to popular belief, I don't think that suicide is a selfish decision.You can get to a point where it feels like living...continuing along...seems like a burden to others. That you're a drain on others' time and emotions and that the only way to make it better is to take yourself out of the equation. I've felt that. I truly believed it. It is possible to feel like there is no way out. That you're so tangled up in life and it's become something you never intended it to be and didn't really realize that that's where you'd ended up until it was too late. When you look around and it it all just seems so broken....so thoroughly unfixable....that bowing out truly, sincerely, seems like the best way to unmuddle things. It's a strange feeling; to feel completely wound up with anxiety that you can feel it coil around you, feel it like a pit in your stomach that never really goes away. To feel heavy...so heavy, as if you were made of sand or trying to run underwater. Yet, at the same time to feel completely hollow. Hopelessness is a funny thing that way. You don't just wake up one day like a switch is flipped. It's a slow progression. You'll be fine. You think you're fine. And every so often, an awful thought will creep in. Just a flash of a thought that you push away to the furthest corners of your mind. But those thoughts start to come more frequently, with more urgency, pushing in from the corners of your mind until they're a thrumming constant. You know it's wrong. That's the catch. You know you're not supposed to feel that way. You know you're supposed to talk to someone, tell someone, ask for help, take some sort of medication. But there is a point where you know, you're certain, that that won't help. You don't even know how to form the words. You feel guilty all the time. A heavy, thick guilt because you know you have so much to be thankful for, that you have it pretty good. That you don't really deserve to be unhappy...you don't have that right.And you're tired. Bone tired. A deep exhaustion that can't be explained to someone else, that doesn't make sense. You try to keep it together. Try to convince yourself that if you can just put on a happy face and keep moving forward that you will continue to just keep moving forward. You hope that by doing this that moving forward will become habit...that it will stop being something that wears you out and seems like an impossible task and that at some point you won't even have to think about it at all.But sometimes that doesn't happen. You lie awake composing letters to loved ones in your head. You wonder what you could say, if it were the last thing you'd ever say to them, to try to explain. To try to tell them how much they mean to you. To apologize for the unforgivable. Because it is unforgivable. Because for someone who has never felt that way it's impossible for them to ever understand how someone could. It's  terribly lonely and comforting all at the same time, knowing that they don't understand. That they're not able. Because you wouldn't wish this feeling on anyone.You think, in a nakedly honest way, that they...life...everything you touch...would be better off without you. That you've ruined things enough. That you've burdened them enough. You know they will hurt and be sad, but people get over things like that. They will be okay. They are capable of being okay.So, you see, suicide feels like the only unselfish thing you can do.""","0.0931162536","0.5184651613","0.19761440160000002"

"The excellent [Diary Junction](http://thediaryjunction.blogspot.com/) blog has just done a piece about the journals of author John Fowles. Charles Drazin, the editor of the published versions of the journals, said the author had told him to leave in the negative parts:> Drazin explains that he made a conscious effort not to censor the diaries in any way, though it was impossible not to have qualms about many passages that were bound to upset people. I thought it was important, he goes on to say, that John should have the opportunity to consider whether there were any comments that he regretted and wished to remain private. > From our resulting conversations it quickly became clear that there were many comments he regretted, but he had made them and, however foolish or wrong or hurtful they might seem now, the vital quality of the journal was to record how he had felt at the time. The decision to leave such comments, even when they tended to be particularly hurtful to his closest friends - who after all were the most readily available victims - stems from his deepest instincts as a writer.","0.11488718540000001","0.5678970814000001","0.1387163103"

"I like justify myself, thats not all correct though. I guess you can say I like to reassure and console myself by getting others opinions. I know its not fair to the people around me but i cant help it due to my inability to talk about what bothers me directly to the person. This week we had an event at the local play of which me and my boyfriend were a part of. They had candy grams and i love candy, but i only had a spare dollar so i bought candy for Cory(bf) instead of myself which is cool i can buy candy for myself anytime and this was special for the event. Much later on i see Cory buying a candy gram from the stand and i assumed it was for me. I did a little happy dance and hid before he could see me stalking him.  .I can see now that i set myself up, once again for dissapointment. Once i got to the stand to collect it i saw that i didnt get anything from anyone. I just shrugged it off, maybe he was buying one for himself, as it was something i was about to do i wasnt bothered so whatever.. Later on at the after party his buddy came up to him to thank him for the candygram and i got a little sad because i know he had like 5$ on him and he did not get me one. I know it sounds a little over dramatic but my feelings got hurt. I asked him jokingly to hide the hurt why he didnt get me one and brought up that i got him one and he said thank you and was very sweet about the thanking. He replied that he just didnt think of me when he was buying the one for his buddy. THAT got me visably upset and he saw that and said sorry but that he didnt think it should matter in hindsight. I got really sad and i understand that it really doesnt matter but i like to hear someone thought of me expessially someone i have been dating for over 2years now. Just him saying that he didnt think of it but he thought to give a gag candy to his buddy(allergic to chocolate) really hurt.. So i told him about it and started joking in the nitpicky way about it for the rest of the night when he didnt seem to understand why it was such a problem. Everytime he was talking about remembering something or anytime he made a stupid reference i would say something like ""you remember that but you didnt think of me huh?"" I was doubting my own feelings and knew i was being dramatic so i tried to get him to understsnd by bringing others into it. I told his buddy that Cory would make a better boyfriend to him since he at least thought of him, i told his brother when he asked why i was in such a crappy mood after a great performance. I did all this in front of him so people who he talked to could maybe show him why what he did sucked. I feel bad about it but honestly i can only get him to understand when we get a middle party for our arguments. Eventually he apologized and swore to make it up to me and i forgive him.

"So I've made several attempts at starting a journal, and there are several things that have prevented me making it a habit. The biggest challenge is that I'm paranoid of someone reading it. Not just someone randomly coming across it, because I know I could hide it well. But like if I were to die and someone had to sort out my belongings. It's strange, because I normally don't think about death much, and if I do, I don't worry about what happens when I'm gone, because I'd be gone. But this is different. I'm worried I'd write my honest thoughts that would post-humously hurt someone I care about or something.I've tried online journaling, but it feels cold and impersonal. The act of actually writing is what appeals to me. I've also tried using alternate scripts, but it just takes too much brain power to figure out what it is I'm writing, or to go back and re-read.

"Day One on OS X has gone from being literally my favourite app of all, particularly when combined with the iOS, to one that I just won't touch with its standard settings.The removal of iCloud and Dropbox syncing combined with the removal of 'Classic Day One' from the app store (indicating that support and new features on that are now on a death sentence) are just a plainly cynical cash move and a TERRIBLE security move.Why on earth would I want to upload the one thing that is most precious and private to me in unencrypted form to a service I have absolutely ZERO reason to trust with my data? Imagine if they had a security breach and their database was compromised.  Suddenly my very private data which is associated with me and my email address are in the hands of bad guys.This is completely unacceptable.The company has tried to claim that they have changed syncing options because the previous ones were 'unreliable' and they routinely point to problems with iCloud. What about Dropbox? I've been syncing my Day One journal via Dropbox for years without any problem at all and I want to continue to do that.Day One used to be a app that served as a great journalling client to my data which was stored on Dropbox. Now they want to turn the entire thing into a service in its own right - and no doubt charge for that service down the line.I used to love tapping out entries on my phone during idle moments of the day but now I have removed the enforced Day One sync and simply will not use the iPhone app.Instead I am only using Day One on my Mac which I am manually backing up to Dropbox (you can't even change the default location where Dropbox stores its data on the desktop - you have to manually dig around in your OS X Library folder). If I'm out and about and have something I want to journal about, I'll instead tap it into Notes and then copy/paste it into Day One when I'm back at my Mac.I want the old Day One syncing options back. I don't want to use Day One sync, I want to HAVE THE CHOICE of doing it via iCloud or Dropbox. I know I'm part of a massive group of people who feel the same.What a way to massively screw up a beautiful bit of software.","0.0760077462","0.2976454794","0.4969472587"
"So I just convinced myself to shell some money for the new Day One 2 out. Both, iOS and Mac app and I am super disappointed. The new version is very laggy and unresponsive while the Classic one is snappy and reacts immediately to anything I do. I also keep finding bugs that just feel lazy.Here are some examples:- Hiding / Showing the split pane thing with CMD+D takes a solid 2s before it takes effect- Switching between journals takes 2s as well- Clicking on an entry while the split pane is off takes up to 3s- The animation when changing entries feels very sloppy and chunky- Hiding the sidebar and clicking on an entry will show the sidebar again but with half of the pane size - effectively resizing the window smaller- Responsiveness when resizing the window is super laggy. Even resizing the safari window is faster- Photos are aligned in a weird way and don't fit into the entryIgnoring of course stuff like missing sync with Dropbox or iCloud drive and smaller features like missing hashtags.This entire app feels like it is running a browser/webview packaged in an app and not really like a native tool. It also spikes up CPU usage when doing the actions above. What happened with the super fast app that I bought before? I also don't get why there is suddenly so much focus on multiple journals. Especially new users to journaling will find it very confusing to maintain multiple journals instead of one. Am I the only one with these problems?So far, I am very very unhappy with this upgrade and will file a refund with Apple.

"Life growing up in America. All these story lines i was nurtured with. Its not really any of that is it. Not just the movies and television, or the angry songs....but life itself. A beginning middle and end.....setup for all of us...the way its supposed to be, and everything works out because things are good. I feel like this could be anything and we only consider a few limited options. What can i do really. I can starve to death and die with a lonely feeling in my body. I can pretend none of it ever existed and go on my way. I can let it all build up inside ready to fall over.I'd like to live, but i dont want to die. I never thought it would happen to me...lost and out of ideas...ready to drop everything, I need to find something that works. Something that feels right. Damn i want to believe i can feel alright, and in the right place, but there i go again...looking for that magic storyline.","0.10322092470000001","0.4852088988","0.1679020077"
"I bought myself a shiny new blank page Leuchtturm 1917 last week to use as my new journal. I usually just write in my journals and occasionally sketch, but the bulk of them is just page after page of writing, so I thought I'd try more 'visual' journaling i.e. sticking in tape, pictures, ephemera etc. So I sat down on the weekend to give it a go. I hated it immediately!  I cut the pages I'd done out and started again, thinking I'd get used to it being different - same result.&nbsp;So I now have a near new notebook with two missing pages. I shoved it in my used journals box and there it will stay. And I am totally ok with it! I've found what works for me and I'd hate to turn something I love into a chore by forcing myself to continue with it if it's not singing for me.  Anyone else experience that? Just an instant love or hate for a certain kind of writing/journaling?  Did you settle on your type of journaling right away, or did it take you a while to find what you really enjoyed?","0.16199985150000001","0.43282213810000003","0.2318646908"
"New to the bunch. I am trying to journal for 3+ years now on my iPhone and Mac. I constantly loose touch after 2-3 months and forget about it. When I set a reminder, I just let it go, don't feel like writing, I don't think I have anything to say. There seems to be missing some intrinsic motivation to keep going but I can't figure out what it is. Does this sound familiar and if so, how did you overcome this?

"I started journaling in 2000, at the age of 10. What's funny is that I ALWAYS wanted to find a notebook that I loved and would purchase again and again to have a uniform journal collection. Obviously that never happened, but I suppose that looking at this eclectic collection is interesting for some navel-gazing in its own right. I journal anywhere from once every few months to 10 pages a day for a week straight. Over the years I think I average out to about a page a day, but, again, it varies widely. I tend to write about various relationships, thoughts, travels, new adventures, rarely day-to-day minutiae, and almost never world affairs.  I usually write during a commute, so I light lightweight, bendable journals. I'm using a Leuchtturm journal for the first time, so perhaps that will end up finally being my ""forever"" notebook.

"Hello! I started religiously keeping a journal on my 17th birthday in 2011. Earlier I wrote on my computer but then decided it wasn't authentic enough and also...handwriting your mind on paper just feels better. I have my junior year in high school to graduation all locked in a strongbox. How many? Maybe...18-20 books, ranging in size. Anywhere from 7 pages to 300 pages for these notebooks, yet overall....currently I'm certain I'm over the 2000 page mark.As soon as I started college, I started buying 300-400 page notebooks. These would be finished within a semester; over the summer, I would write so little that I would still have 250 pages for the semester.Reading them over makes me feel like all I wrote happened to another person. But I was a different person; we all were four years ago. No man steps in the same river twice, for he is not the same man, and it is not the same river. However, the content of these journals is quite normal. Crushes, hopes for the future, being pissed at parents, all that stuff...and Bach.I intend to keep writing for many, many years. Starting at 17...suppose I die at 87? That's seventy years of words, words on paper. Trouble is, my handwriting is garbage, so nobody can read my writing...bad or good?","0.1401153505","0.5052292943","0.190286845"
