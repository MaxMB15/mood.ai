"Im lying in bed on a Friday night, my beautiful husband is sober and snoring away, My awesome dog is lying between us with her head on my lap. Im watching Dr. Who and drinking champagne because I did the impossible at work this month, and because of it, I might be getting a raise or a bonus or an iPad or all 3, but I literally accomplished the impossible!! Also, this marks my 6 month anniversary of not smoking cigarettes. My beloved, ridiculously gorgeous sister (who is also the coolest person in the universe and my absolute best friend) survived brain surgery (brain tumor) and has a benign diagnosis (5% chance); today she was told she can fly. My sister and her awesome boyfriend (who loves her almost more than I do) are taking my husband and I to Vail, Colorado, and staying at the nicest, fanciest resort for my 30th birthday in a couple of weeks, (Ive never traveled! And this is a place Ive never been). My whole family is alive and healthy.  My god, can it get ANY better than this?",0
"Im a college student and my boyfriend and I, like many others our age, are stressed for finals and uncertain of our futures. Today we temporarily set that aside and slow danced to old classics. We were happy :)",0
I have bad depression. I'm just doing well. :),0
"I'm currently in second year at uni, and I had a group interview for a great placement opportunity for my year out, and its local. They offered me a placement the next day, and I'm over the moon!",0
"For a majority of my life, I've been dirt poor, buried in debt, depressed, unconfident, and unmotivated. Earlier this year, I was laid off and almost unable to pay rent, so I took the biggest gamble of my life; gave up my apartment, gave my stuff away, packed up a few bags and traveled the nation to find myself. In that time, I've had some of the most amazing adventures in my life and I'm genuinely happy with who I'm becoming. Doors are opening left and right for me and I've never been more financially stable and satisfied with what I do. I have quite a bit of savings now and I've been very careful, but it dawned on me to do something that I've never been able to do; I want to be Santa this year and buy all of my family and friends presents.It's never really been expected from any of us because we're always penny pinching, ever since I was young. On a few occasions, I would buy a few things for the kids just so I can help contribute to a real Christmas for them. This time, however, i want everyone to know I appreciate everything they've ever done for me. When I was hurting, asking for advice, lonely, looking for a place to stay, lost, none of them ever hesitated to be there.I know they're not expecting anything from me because it's always assumed that I won't get them anything and that's okay. But this year, it's my year and I want them to know how I feel. It's going to be expensive, but every single one of them deserves it.",0
"I was practicing for half a year and almost no one knew, I had been so nervous and I almost passed out in auditions, this is the best I've felt in a long time!",0
"And i love it! I already got accepted but i didnt visit the campus yet, and its everything i could ask for. Its surrounded by The Adirondack Mountains and i can study to be a Wilderness Therapist there. Theres so much to do and i will never be bored, its so quiet and peaceful there. Its been a couple years of struggling so much to figure out what i want to do and once i found it and discovered this school, everything fell into place. I am seriously so happy to have found a school that feels so right for me :)",0
"I dont know where else to express my feelings, sitting in the quiet section of a library right now. I took my Anat and Phys test last week expecting a C because that usually what I get. I check my grade and I got an A!!I wanna dance right now but then people will think Im weird. This made my week!! ",0
"On my side of the family, the youngest is in college, so I haven't had family kids around since I was a kid.I got married this fall. My husband is amazing and wonderful and his family accepts me and is also awesome and just... HAPPINESS. I'm so excited to see them for the holidays.His sister has 3 kids. We went a little crazy shopping for gifts for them together. He and I are basically still 5 year old on the inside, so it's so much fun having a reason to go toy and picture book shopping.Also, I'm trans (ftm) and haven't told many people yet. But my niece who is turning 3 today is on to me - she calls me ""Uncle Kim"" about half the time. It's really nice to be gendered right at a family gathering.",0
"Was told two weeks ago that my position was being eliminated. Luckily the company gave me two weeks to find a new job before letting me go. Today I received an offer for my first salary position at a great company with all the trimmings - insurance, 401(k), holidays, vacation, and annual bonus.Couldn't be happier. Especially with rent due today and Christmas coming up.",0
I've been seeing an osteopath regularly for several months and my headaches and pain are finally under control. I was almost at the point of seeing a doctor about depression but now I'm finally pain free and I have energy for the first time in over a year and my mood is so much better. Pain and exhaustion can't be underestimated.That moment when I realised I wasn't in pain was such a relief. I think the treatment releases some endorphins but I am grinning like a Cheshire cat today. ,0
i'm taking radio classes at my school's technical campus and my first show aired today!,0
"So a few weeks ago I quit my job and I started working at a restaurant across the street from my house. This restaurant seemed very convenient since it was so close and I would get tips, unlike my retail job. Although my retail job was actually pretty great when it came to having good coworkers, I thought it was worth it because I wouldnt have to uber or bus to work anymore since I dont have a car. Upon getting hired at the restaurant, I informed the manager/owner that I have to be sure about this job because my mom and I combine our checks to get by every month. He told me to quit and start working for him, which I did. When I started working there, he wasnt planning on paying me for training (I know its illegal but Im a fucking pushover and I didnt know what to do in that moment). So on my first day the Manager proceeded to insult me multiple times such as saying oh do you think the customer is gonna clean up his own table? When I actually checked on the customer multiple times and he was fine. That same night he told me to come dressed in a white button up and I didnt have one since he told me to wear black when I got hired. He told me to get a white button up at midnight and expected me to have it the next day. So the next day which is my second day of work I come to work in a black button up because thats all I had and I didnt have time to go to the mall which is pretty far from my house. He comes in and tells me I told you to get a white shirt, why arent you wearing a white shirt I explained that he told me on too short of notice and then he told me when I tell you to do something you do it, dont give me any excuses ok?. He constantly complained about how I was too slow but in reality he just expected too much from a server. He wanted me to make hookahs, pour alcoholic drinks (which I know nothing about), serve tables, be cashier and host all at the same time. Im 19 so making hookahs and pouring alcohol are illegal here in the US. (Three illegal things in a matter of two days)On my third day of work, which was my last day of work I opened the restaurant alone. The chef and the dishwasher were with me, I organized and cleaned the place up, took down reservations. All of a sudden two couples and a table of four comes in at the same time and its my third day so I get really overwhelmed. I had to get drinks, hookahs, food for all the tables and take phone orders all at the same time. I started panicking and I made a huge fool of myself because I was going very slow. A customer asked me to get her some kind of cocktail and I had no idea what the hell she wanted because once again I dont know shit about alcohol. She ended up going behind the bar and getting what she wanted. I almost dropped the hookah, I had to write everything down manually because I didnt know how to use the POS system very well yet. The chef was about to cry, I was about to cry. The Manager/owner finally decides to show up and starts yelling at me for making a mess of everything when in reality hes a cheap, irresponsible person who lets a new employee work alone on her third day in a fine dining restaurant. He starts telling me that I didnt do shit the entire day. He then proceeds to tell me that he speaks arabic with me, speaks English with me and I dont understand anything. (He and I both speak Arabic). Then I end up leaving because he tells me to go home, I told him I couldnt work there anymore if things were like this. This is where things get good: Im on my way home after quitting and being humiliated. I hear someone yelling me name across the street while Im on the phone with my mom on the verge of tears. I see that its one of the customers I had who was very nice to me. I walk up to her and she hands me 40 bucks. She asks me if I got fired and I just burst into tears at this point because I cant really not have a job since Im not financially stable. She tells me to wait and comes back and hands me another hundred and just holds me while I sob. I told her that I just couldnt handle the pressure and that Im sorry I fucked up her orders and everything. Her friends that were with her (one of which made fun of me and didnt realize that I heard him) all told me I did a great job and that nobody could handle the pressure I was under. One of them gave me a big hug and told me she was so proud of me and she just showered me with comforting words. She then told me that they gave my manager a piece of their mind, which made me feel so much better. They offered to take me home despite me living across the street. I got in the car and the lady that told me she was proud of me gave me another hundred bucks. When I got to my house they told me to stop crying and that everything would be alright. I couldnt believe how my night turned from thinking people were awful to understanding that theres still great people out there. I was truly amazed by their generosity and kindness. I will never forget these people. They were so good to me in my time of need. The interesting thing was, the woman that helped me had a name that translated into happiness in Arabic, and she truly lives up to her name by spreading love and care the way she did for me. God bless those people.(Sorry for the grammatical errors)TLDR: quit my job to work for a terrible person, he humiliated me in front of everyone at work, customers swooped in and saved the day.P.S: I ended up getting my entire check in full :) including training.",0
"I downloaded Reddit randomly almost exactly a year ago, out of randomness and boredom. It might've been the best decision I had ever made. I'm a highschooler and Reddit has helped me through so much. It helped me stay alot calmer and have more to do besides sleep in my room, and it helped me get past some depression I was having from lack of time. Now I'm happy and I love Reddit. I mean, me too thanks",0
"This goes out to everyone who thinks they're too ugly, unmotivated, unkind, introverted etc. to be loved. I thought I was all of those things but in the past few months I've been dating the most wonderful person. I love her with all my heart and she loves me so much to. I didn't really know where else to post this so i'm sorry if it violates the guidelines but i'm just so happy and I want tell everyone how great life can be. We're together all the time and we text each other when we're not and nothing ever seems to go wrong. Whatever happens around us we just deal with it together and keep on loving each other. I need to say it again reddit: I'M SO HAPPY!",0
"This is a throwaway because I don't think I can associate my casual account with this (mildly drunk) post. I'm working in cochlear implant research, in the neuroscience department at Cambridge University. For those who don't know, CIs are essentially 'bionic ears'. They are electronic devices which allow deaf people to hear again. We are quite literally performing biblical miracles here. Every day just fills me with so much joy! I've been in the room when we turn on a patient's CI - I've seen someone, who has been deaf for 20 years, hear her husband's voice for the first time. It was the most profound moment of my entire life. This is why we devote our lives to scientific reseach! This is why all those late nights were worth it! I cannot express how happy I am. Every day I wake up in disbelief that this is my life now. It means so god-damn much to me. I'm so happy. I can't say any of this to my friends, because I worry that it comes across as bragging. It probably does, and I'm sorry for that. But this is a throwaway and if any community on Reddit understands and forgives me, it's gonna be you lovely people. Friends, aim for the stars. Apply for jobs that you have no business applying for. Apply for positions for which you are woefully unqualified. Aim high, and expect to fail. Take every failure in your stride, ignore that little voice which says you're not good enough, and just bloody go for it. You fail 100 times before you succeed. I'm dumb as shit. If I can somehow manage this, so can you. Everything is beautiful and nothing hurts:) :) :) :) :)",0
"Ive finally graduated from college!! Oh boy, it feels so amazing!First step of my long and hard academic adventure is behind me at last. I know it might not be such a big thing but I just wanted to share it with someone. ",0
"My last few months have been very hard.My depression and anxiety have been really kicking me recently and my grades and social life have suffered because of it, however this last week things have seemed to improve a bit. I made a breakthrough with my therapist, and last night the man of my dreams said that he loved me. This morning I woke up smiling because of him, and as I walked to my classes for the day it started snowing. I just stood and admired the beautiful snowflakes, my heart was so full I almost burst into tears. In love, watching the first snowfall of the year, and my favorite song was playing through my headphones. I think that I can finally understand what it feels like to be overcome with joy. ",0
"Although I doubt he knew it was my birthday tomorrow, he was cleaning out a closet in the band room and pulled out an ibenez bass that the pickups didn't work on and was going to throw it out but I asked if I could have it because even though it was broken, it was still better than the one I had and he gave it to me, Pretty good day!",0
"So I was looking nearly everywhere for a MSI GTX 1080 Armor OC graphics card because it's [so aesthetic](https://images10.newegg.com/ProductImage/14-127-945-S99.jpg) and for a good price. I asked around in nearly 6 shops over two weeks and the final shop gave me the good news.The guy behind the phone said ""Wow, you're lucky! This is the last one we have."". I was so uplifted by this, and to make matters better, the guy even made delivery free so I don't have to pay extra money!Glorious PC master race, here I come!",0
"Years of therapy after ending a physically abusive marriage, I said yes to the love of my life, and we will be getting married this summer. He convinced me to go back to school, where I have been thriving (with straight A's) and even convinced me to go for a job I would have never believed I could get (I've been there for a year and a half now.) He truly believes there's nothing I can't do, and I've never experienced that before.  I just finished booking our dream honeymoon, and it all got so real so fast. This is actually happening. I came from absolute hell on earth, and here I am surrounded by so much love and joy. Thank you for giving me a sounding board to vent my extreme happiness! ",0
"I won't spoil anything but I guarantee if you take to heart the message conveyed in the video, you're bound to start feeling more happy and positive overall. Give it a whirl!Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHv6vTKD6lg",0
"I never thought it would actually come to this.  I almost gave up and took an absolutely horrible job just to help alleviate one or two of the above symptoms but thankfully I didn't.In January I (as long as the offer letter doesn't get rescinded) will be starting in a job I've dreamt about since high school.I'm scared, nervous, excited, but most of all - HAPPYThey're also letting me take my already planned vacation between Christmas and New Years so I can visit wedding venues with my fiance (since it's an out of state wedding).  Also, my fiance moved in-state, but was still about an hour away due to public transportation (NJ to NYC...12 miles but 1.5 hours :|).  So now that my job is in the city, we're moving in together. Which is a far cry from the ""once-every-three-months"" trips we used to plan to see each other.Literally everything in my life just fell into place and I don't even know what to do with myself.  I just need to express it somewhere!!!!",0
"TL;DR - Poor mental health does not mean a lack of mental toughness. Last October (2016) I had to part ways with my girlfriend of almost six years. I am bipolar so it put me in a horrible depression (made worse by cold weather elongated low cycles). It broke me, it was never that bad before. The drastic life change made my brain go haywire, worstening all my symptoms. Even after months of weekly therapy and almost doubled medication dosage I'm still broken. Amidst my pain, I showed up to work everyday regardless. It kept my mind busy and gave me purpose. When I snapped out of the deep lows in about March, mania cycles kicked in harder than ever before as well. I experienced almost daily severe anxiety with panic attacks. I eventually said  you to the anxiety and suicidal ideology, and used my anguish as motivation to fight harder than ever before... Last quarter I reported the best numbers in all of the Accounts Receivable department and got a new job within the company that comes with a 30% pay bump and I start Monday! I feel like I am living proof that poor mental health does not mean a lack of mental toughness. With support from my family and friends, my therapist, my psychiatrist, Van Halen, and a burning desire to overcome, I made it through the worst year of my life. My ex was very understanding and graceful about the break up and helped me get through the most. She is now my best friend and main support outside of my medical support. I owe all my support members my life and will do my best to return the favor. Thank you for reading and letting me share. I hope this reaches others with BPD and other mental health issues to remind them they're stronger than their illness. Be excellent to each other!",0
Im literally vibrating at my desk!,0
I finally got what was probably my best night's sleep in months! I feel fantastic. I just had to share. (The noise difference is ridiculous...it went from very frequent bumps so hard that my own furniture vibrated to barely hearing any footsteps.),0
"Eventhough my laptop is awful broken and have no money for food until Monday, I am happy that people on Reddit help each other. Once I saw there is one offered to gilded everyone ask, once I saw there are a lot people sending cards for cheering up the kid who is sick, and I saw a wife try to give surprise for her husband by birthday card from the whole world by reddit users, and once I saw people sent $6 for help who is need. I am happy to know that kindness is real. Have a nice day, folks!",0
"I'm a little nervous, but so excited! We've just been calling it ""the apartment"" (maybe to make me a little less nervous!)... Well, we're about to be in OUR apartment soon!!I've been living in a house with roommates I don't particularly get along with, to put it lightly, and I'm just so relieved that I don't have to deal with their drama anymore. In a few days, I will be living in my dream apartment with the cutest cat in the world, my best friend ever, and in the best location in my city. I. Am. So. Happy!",0
I just got off the phone and I'm still trying to wrap my head around it but this is the happiest I've been in years! I can finally provide comfortably for my family!,0
"Im in my senior year of high school, Im finally getting good grades, finally able to focus, got a semblance of a college plan, working hard on making art and comics every day, and just yesterday, I had a sort of a date with a girl I have a huge crush on. Im just in a damn good mood.",0
"Last night I got the feedback from my Grad Research Paper. And it is going to be submitted for publishing! I never got so anxious about an assignment. We had some hard times im the research group dealing with eachother, whole days without sleep, remaking spreadsheets over and over again, and we got frustrated so many times, but it was all worth it. Last night when they told us, we had no reaction. But today I realised what this whole thing means, and it's really overwhelming. Some people in the government heard about this and I might be getting funds to do another research.  But I'm not happy for all that, because what really got me was my mom telling me she spent all day saying how proud of me she is, and my dad telling me he was extremely happy for me. Sometimes I feel like I don't give them back enough, because they are great parents, so things like this really make me happy. ",0
"I just wanted to say I feel happy. Everything is so calm and quiet. I think I'm meditating, or at least feel like it. I'm so numb and happy and calm its wonderful",0
its too early to tell family but i figure its OK to tell Reddit. this is something we have both talked about for a long time and its finally happened. she sees her doctor in a week and we are definitely going over board on the planning. just needed to tell someone because its had to keep such a big secret.,0
"My depression has been kicking my butt lately. These two kids came up to the counter to chat with me. I made them some ice cream sundaes, they were so happy! The father kept apologising for how long the kids had been chatting to me, but they honestly made me so happy. Thanks little girl for being so kind :) ",0
 ...and she wasn't sure if I anyone else had told max It made my day since I've been doing 3 peoples jobs for the last 3-4 months  and never feel like I'm doing enough. ,0
I looked at people who drove cars like they were gods. I grew up never having a vehicle in the family and I assumed since we weren't very wealthy that only the richest drive. I never thought I'd be able to drive one day.. but here I am !! Never been happier. ,0
super excited I am so nervous to meet him in person. We have been talking through social media and text for a week or so and have a date scheduled for this Friday. I don't think I've felt this nervous and excited in awhile. I think I'm nervous because it has the possibility to be the real thing. Just wanted to share I am soooo excited!!!,0
"I'm not a huge fan of the cold, but man do I carry a boat load of stuff on me at all times (keys, keycards, wallet, phone(s), change, etc.) and when I can comfortably wear a coat/jacket, I've got plenty of extra pockets for those things!Just a little bonus that brought a smile to my face today when I noticed I wasn't struggling to cram stuff into my pockets. That's all!Hope everyone had a good holiday!",0
"I work as a bagger at a grocery store and at work today this older guy came through my line who was wearing a green shirt with a bunch of bison all over it. I told him that bison are some of my favorite animals and that I really liked his shirt. He immediately perked up and said ""No way! My wife hates this shirt because it's starting to get a little worn around the edges. She hates when I wear it! I can't wait to get home and tell her what you said!"" I told him that it just adds a bit of character and it shows that he has loved the shirt. He said he likes to wear it because he has worn it for so long and made it super comfy now.  It was just very cute how excited and happy it made him that  1 someone was validating his feelings about something he liked and  2 that he would get to neener neener neener at his wife later :)",0
"We didn't start as friends but we might as well have. I've never had it where I have everything: we cut up and play around as friends, we play funny little games like getting fake upset or fake jealous over ridiculous things, we were attracted to each other since day 1, we respect and are honest with each other (like if our breath stinks, or if we wear something unflattering, etc.), we like to have intellectual conversations and it's ok if we disagree, we both have good income and don't depend on each other... and probably more that's not coming to mind at the moment.

"November 2016 after years of dealing with depression and anxiety I tried to blow my brains out in my grandparents garage, and I can finally say I'm glad I didn't! 2017 has been an adventure, from running away to Colorado and finding out how much I love skiing to meeting some amazing people and getting closer to my old friends. And to top it all off I've started dating the most wonderful girl, I can't help but smile whenever I'm with her. I know things won't last forever but I am for once genuinely happy to be alive and just wanted to share. ~thank you dear reader ",0
"Ever since I was 12, I did not like myself at all. It was hard looking in a mirror and liking him. It was hard looking at my personality and liking it. I battled depression for 4 years and after that, Ive been battling borderline personality disorder and low self esteem for 2 years.I recently got news from my therapist that Im pretty much in remission for borderline personality disorder and Im very very VERY close to be considered recovered. My grades in this semester of college ended up the way I wanted them to, I finally went on a date after 3 years of not being on one and me and him clicked instantly and we have a second date coming up, I got rid of a toxic friend and I found my true friends. This is all Ive wanted out of life. To be happy. 8 years I hated myself. Today I can say I love myself and truly mean it. I couldnt be happier. ",0
"i'm using a throwaway account for this because i don't want the karma but no one in real life will know about this so i might as well share with internet strangers.i grew up the only child of immigrants and although i had want for few things we were fairly poor when i was growing up.one of the more vivid memories i had from my childhood was entering a contest at the local big-box toy store where the winner got a shopping spree to fill up their cart with as many toys as they could fit.  naturally i didn't win and though i realize it's just ""stuff"", that feeling of sadness stuck with me.fast forward lots of school and hard work, i now have a wife and family of my own.  i have been exceedingly fortunate in my life.  this past black friday i swung by that big box toy store, grabbed a cart and took a few laps around the store.  i picked all those toys younger me would have loved to have.  there were times i had to play tetris with the boxes in the cart to make them fit.  the tired cashier gave me some bug-eyes and i think some of the other customers may have given me some looks but i was too excited to pay much attention.i payed for all my toys, had them bagged up and pulled the cart the extra 15 feet to the toys for tots collection box where i placed all the bags and went home.  25 years later i finally got my toy shopping spree.  best feeling ever.",0
"I already knew this, but today I feel like I'm exploding.I was having a really bad day.PMS/family drama was making me feel extremely depressed. I just wasn't even getting out of bed.My boyfriend decided to come to my house, he bought me my favourite sweets (which I had finished 'cause i eat them for breakfast) and then laid down with me in bed to cuddle and make me laugh. After dinner he bought me McDonald's Mcflurry which I hadn't had in ages and made me laugh some more. I can't wait to see him again tomorrow, he's my ray of sunshine and cup of tea during a rainy day  ",0
"I met my partner in April of 2016, he had been diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis two years earlier and I knew what I was getting into. In May of 2016 he got the call that he would be receiving a new treatment called Lemtrada in June, I remember he was frustrated because it seemed so far away. He got his first infusions and other than a bit of fatigue he didn't experience many side effects, his team attributed this to him being one of the youngest male patients to be given the treatment. The treatment essentially smashes the lymphocytes that are attacking his myelin sheath, it's not a cure, it's a disease modifying drug and at current time the best hope is that his body will regrow new lymphocytes that won't attack his myelin.Over the next year we made some big steps, bought our first car, moved in together, he even started working part time at his brother in laws start up, when it came time for his next infusion we had to delay them because he had some issues with his teeth, he had been in an accident a while back and his root canals were becoming infected. July of 2017 he got his second round of infusions and other than a rash that went away after 2 benadryl he had no side effects! Now here we are, November of 2017, he had an MRI earlier in the month and on Wednesday we went to his neurologist to get the results of it, he was very nervous as he felt like he may be relapsing. His neurologist comes in with a big smile on her face, he has no new lesions! Ok so we're happy, then she tells us that the lesions he has haven't grown in size and are starting to heal!!!!!! Such freaking good news! She asked if over the past year and a half he had taken any sort of medication, other than his prescribed medical cannabis, and with the exception of 2 benadryl he hadn't.  She had looked through his records with his nurse before the appointment and wanted to confirm that. She then told him that she believes the cannabis helped him through the side effects of Lemtrada and she wants to start prescribing it to her other patients who will be getting Lemtrada!! She also is considering doing a case study on him for other neurologists because of his success!I know that was quite the read, but I'm so happy and excited that my wonderful partner is getting better and I've already bragged to all my friends and family so now I want to tell the whole interweb!Tl;Dr: Life is so amazing and science is so amazing and cannabis is so amazing!!!!!",0
"This could just be me, but I used to be very cocky and high on myself. This came with me constantly comparing myself to others and wanting to be remembered and known as a huge success and etc, etc. Someday something just clicked in me, after reading a bunch of literature on the subject and also having real life experiences that helped contribute to it, but I believe I had an ego death. As in I could care less what others think of me, but I still treat them as I would like to be treated. Suddenly I found I wasn't constantly unhappy because I wasn't achieving something that society would consider ""succesful"". Suddenly I was appreciative of the fact that I had lived a good life and had a good family. I feel all these huge expectations we've placed on ourselves can be these constant reminders of what you're not achieving.I'm not saying to not shoot for the stars, I'm just saying that i've discovered an entirely different way of living, and that is to just make sure im happy and comfortable. If I die with people who love me, yet no one remembers me besides them. I still lived a great life worth living. Sidenote: It completely obliterated my love of rap and hip hop because 99 percent of those songs are ego boasting lol",0
"I live in a small town and dont drive so the job search has been incredibly difficult for me, but, after months of searching and applying, i officially start work on monday!Even better is that its a ob with a good company with a decent wage, so i can finally start moving forwards.

And that means I get to spend tons of time with my wife!!!!!!  I love that woman!,0
"I don't know if this is the right subreddit for this, but I wanted to put it in words somewhere. I have two friends who are married to each other and they both just mean so damn much to me. I came over to hangout for a movie night and they both fell asleep but honestly, I don't know that I've ever felt truly happier. I've struggled with depression for quite a while but they make me feel genuinely loved and appreciated and I'm currently bawling like a little baby because I'm so filled with a loving happiness.

He graduated in 2014 with a Bachelor of Education from an Ontario university, and has been trying to get into both public and private schools ever since.Today, he called me at work with amazing news: he has been hired as an English AND History teacher at a private school just up the road from us!! I am SO over the moon happy for him! There were times when he didn't want to renew his teacher's membership. It can be hard facing rejection so many times.. I'm grateful that he didn't give up and has landed a job in his field! ",0
"All my life I've been incredibly insecure. In school I've always struggled with presentations and getting attention.Last year I started a new school that focuses on music - a hobby I've had for basically all my life. I've grown so much as a person since starting there and lately we've had a lot of concerts. I haven't been nervous at all, and all the gigs make me so happy.I'm so glad I've gotten out of the dump I used to be in, and that I get to feel like this every day. ",0
"My husband got a job in another town pretty far away. He moved there 5 months ago. Selling the house was a nightmare, the first month we didn't have a single showing. We dropped the price multiple times. We struggled a lot with bills, since we had to continue to pay for the house as well as an apartment and car for him in the new city. I've been living alone and I suffer from anxiety/depression which gets a lot worse when I am alone, so that has been very difficult. Last night I had to take my car to the shop for repairs that ended up costing a lot more than expected-the stress I felt was almost unbearable. 20 minutes later our realtor messaged my husband and I to let us know about an offer with no conditions, we accepted. As of now its official. I'm so happy and relieved I just needed to share! The dark times are finally over and I get to move on! I can quit my job-and move in with my husband-and actually enjoy Christmas this year! ",0

"After months of hemming and hawing over the program I wanted to go into, I got accepted into one program first and just decided to go with it. I am officially attending a zoology undergraduate program in the fall of 2018, with the intention of going to a Veterinarian program. My other option was a nursing program. I've been a crazy animal person all my life. I guess it's time to accept it! Yay zoology, I am so happy! ",0
"Im only 25, but its felt like a long road up to the point. From family issues to struggles with depression, I was pretty resigned to the idea that I would never be truly happy. This year started rough. I was having to work through issues with my boyfriend, I ended up losing my best friend after she became emotionally manipulative and taxing on my mental health, and I was struggling to get out of the job that I hated. Then summer came. Something flipped. I got a job offer working at a high school as an Instructional Assistant (Im working towards becoming a teacher, so I was elated.), my boyfriend and I resolved our issues, I let go of my anxiety with love and life, and I got back into a great university. Right now, Im in a car, exhausted, at the end of an 8 hour ride to my boyfriends fathers home. The fact that we are at this point, where he wants me to be part of his family, means the world to me. I have never had so much love for one person and it surprises me every day. He has been such a great influence on me, and I couldnt be more grateful. Im finally here. My life is moving forward at a real pace now, instead of stalling. Im finally happy. ",0

"I just bought a one-way ticket to Australia in the spring to kick off a long solo trip. I've always been scared of traveling and have always passed on international trip opportunities.

"1) I learned two days ago that I have been accepted into the McNair Scholars Program, which is geared toward graduate school preparation and research. This is a super huge deal for me because I applied last year and was not accepted. I will be doing research for eight weeks again this summer (with a stipend--again!), but now I will also have the opportunity to present my research at conferences across the country (and maybe in Canada or in other countries) with all expenses paid. 2) By the time I graduate, I will have had two paid research fellowships (each eight weeks), I will have been a research assistant for one semester (this coming spring), and I will have completed my Honors thesis over the course of three semesters. I am somehow even more excited for graduate school than I was. :-)3) I somehow have been managing to hold two jobs (working roughly 26-28 hours per week) while taking eighteen credit hours this semester, and I am very proud of myself for it. I learned a lot about myself and what I am capable of, and I feel great! I've stepped outside of my comfort zone a lot this semester. I have been less afraid to ask for help.4) I watched Luna perform twice in one week, and got to see Dean Wareham play ""Tugboat"" (Galaxie 500) in Pittsburgh. 5) I have enough money to actually buy Christmas presents for my parents this year. I purchased/commissioned oil paintings of their cats, and I got my mom a poetry book relevant to my school and bought my dad a Battlestar Galactica action figure for his desk. The poetry book is signed by the editor, who was a professor at my school before I came here, and the action figure just looked really cool (even though he looks like a bad guy). My dad really likes Battlestar Galactica. Handmade presents are still awesome, but it is a really cool thing for me to be able to buy them presents that I hope they will like.6) I get to see my cat in three weeks. I miss him a lot. I also actually played piano and viola for the first time in a while. I can still read music and my fingers still work a little bit like they used to.7) I declared a World Literature and Cultures minor a few weeks ago! Now, I will graduate with an English degree, a Philosophy degree, and also a World Literature and Cultures minor. 8) I start my Honors thesis in the spring. Today, I met with an Honors advisor today and picked up the forms I need to formally begin.9) My grandmother crocheted a beautiful blanket for me. It is black and orange, and I love it.10) I am working on figuring out how I can overcome the medical hurdles that have been thrown at me in regards to getting my student pilot's license. My dream is still to fly, and while I had to change my major from Flight Technology to English and Philosophy, I am still dead-set on being able to fly airplanes--even if I have to fight for it by myself. I tried to ignore that desire for a couple of years, but I am growing and coming to terms with the fact that I will find a way to do what I am passionate about.",0

"This past week has been a refresher, I've literally lived in a tent on food stamps.  - I remembered how awesome candles are!  - Found a legit use for one of my old phones!  A Motorola with built in FM and a battery that lasts for days.- I learned how to press coffee.  Remembered I had a bday giftcard  Bought a press and coffee from statbucks, yay caffeine!  - Yay oil & gas!  My electricity may have been shut off, but my heat+hot water+stove are gas.  ..and about 1/3 the cost of my electric bill.  - Speaking of oil and gas, my old truck makes for an excellent phone charger.  800 cca battery could charge all my devices several times over before needing to start the truck to recharge.  I could probably charge all my devices for a year on $5 worth of gas.  In summary, hey my life might appear to suck (no electricity?!?), it's really not that bad though. I chose to spend a few nights in the dark, more or less on purpose. I'll get mostly caught up on payday and go back to fixing up my hot-rod (2nd car). I've got a lawn, a garage, a job, a dog and coffee. Life's good. :)",0

"Tl:Dr; I got a ~60 on my first differential equation test, I got an 88 on my second!So I have been struggling with anxiety and depression for the last few years, but it has really been bad this last semester. I was having almost daily anxiety attacks. I couldn't focus in class and no matter how much effort I put into studying I was getting 60's on all my tests.Differential equations was particularly difficult to me as it focuses on all the aspects of math that I struggled with most in the past. Even with tutoring I only got a ~60 on my first test, out of two.After a particularly bad day and some dark thoughts, I decided enough was enough and got some help.I started seeing a therapist and psychiatrist and got some medicine to help. I slowly stopped having anxiety attacks and have felt better than I have in years.I took the second differential equations test last week and just got my grade back. An 88!!! I'm just so happy because this feels like physical evidence of how I'm getting better and reaffirms my choices and the fact that what I was feeling was not normal, and it wasnt that I'm not good enough.

I was jet skiing around Clearwater today when I saw a medium sized fishing boat go by pretty fast (for a boat that size) and drop one of those red gas cans with five gallons of fuel in the water. He was about 500 yards away but on the jet-ski it barely took 10 seconds to get  there and pull the tank out of the water. No gas had spilled. I chased the guy down and told him to be careful. Those five gallons of gas can do A LOT of harm to the wildlifeI noticed he was a little red and his speech was slurred. So I followed him to the ramp making sure he wouldnt crash or get in the car with a trailer and a boat. But luckily his friend was there to drive. ,0

"I am so excited about this, I just had to post somewhere. My boyfriend knows to be proud but hes more into science and doesnt care for the finer points of what happened so hes just blindly saying good job! and offering to take me to dinner. I wrote a paper about a new historicist/feminist analysis of The Story of an Hour by Kate Chopin and my professor recommended I submit it to a research conference! I put it alongside A Dolls House, the Declaration of Sentiments, and Hills Manual and my professor said it was clearly very well researched. Im so excited!! This professor has also gotten increasingly tough on me since I took my first class with him, two semesters ago. This is the fourth class Ive taken with him and since he had a baby over the summer hes gotten MUCH tougher, so I know his praise is very genuine. He still grades me fairly but since he knows my writing so well he gives me very candid and detailed feedback. (An entire single spaced page plus written margin commentary that often spills over.) He praised it so much and Im so proud of myself. I really respect that hes always been honest and told me when I can do better (like when I wrote a B paper that definitely would have been an A like I usually get if I put any effort into proofreading but he knew I didnt try because my overall course grade would still be A because I had maxed out extra credit) and I know he wouldnt advise me to submit if he didnt absolutely mean it. He said that my writing has come really far and I know hes right. This paper is a thousand times better than anything I could have written two semesters ago and its actually something to be proud of. I used to be ashamed to have professors read my essays because I knew I could do better but I just kept getting stuck because I would get As anyway because in general in my English department professors are really lenient about grading because they know a lot of people want to go on to grad school where GPA counts for a lot. I knew it wasnt my best and he was the first professor to completely call me out on the fact that while my ideas were good and my presentation was great it was clearly a paper that was making the least work possible look like the best thing possible. He pushed me to do better and I did. I have no idea what this means, as I havent met with him one on one to discuss it further, but I know at the very least it is very high praise from someone I respect. I am almost certain Ill submit it like he recommends, and I might ask for his help submitting it several other places too if its as good as he says it is. Im so freaking happy that I actually started doing my best work and its clearly paying off. ",0

"In July 2016, my 64 yr old dad was diagnosed with Stage 3 Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma. He then underwent chemo treatments for about a year. The treatments were pretty effective against the cancer but it wasn't enough to fully eradicate the tumor on his neck. Fortunately, the doctors recommended radiation therapy which wiped out the remaining of it. In July 2017, we received the best possible news - that he was in remission and officially a non-hodgekins survivor! I knew my dad was supposed to have two CT scans this month to see if he was still in remission. For months, I had been dreading these tests. For the record, the chances of his type of cancer coming back are 60% which is quite frightening. After a week of waiting, we received the results last night and they came back clear showing that he is still in remission! I feel as though I am the luckiest daughter in the world.

"If you guys wanna read a story, here ya go. If not, it's basically me just telling everybody why my boyfriend is an amazing person and my hero. As cheesy as it sounds.My boyfriend was completely and totally my hero yesterday. I stopped for gas on my way home from his house, about a 20 minute drive, and when I got home I couldn't find my wallet. In my panic, I managed to lock my keys in my car, and I panicked even more. I called up my hubby, not exactly begging for help, but it was the first thing that came to mind when I was distressed. I didn't ask him to come over but he rushed over in the middle of whatever he was doing, stopped at the gas station to look for my wallet (wasn't there though), and then came to my house. He then spent the next 30 minutes or so helping me break into my own car (thank god for the guy who taught me how to, since this is the second time now). My boyfriend was the one who managed to get my car open, and immediately found my wallet. It was wedged in a crack under the passenger seat. My boyfriend left for a work related dinner, and during the time he was gone, I managed to upset both of my parents by making a tiny mistake. I accidentally let the cats ruin the dinner I cooked. Oops. Through out all of this, I've been sick with a nasty cold, and already feel like garbage. After his dinner  my boyfriend comes back over, and we cuddle, and he comforts me for a while. We then head to the midnight release of the new Pokemon game, he was getting it, but I didn't have the money to get one. He bought me comfort food on the way there, and then when we get the game he surprises me with my own copy. He bought both of us games. I do things for him too, I try to buy him things and make him feel loved and appreciated, but he manages to always go above and beyond for me. Yesterday I let him know that he was my hero all day long, and I don't know what my dumb ass would do without him. If you see this, I love you so much. You deserve so much for all of the kind and wonderful things you do. You're the love of my life and I can't wait for us to spend the rest of our lives together. I can never tell you enough, or show you, just how much you mean to me.(And yes, I am a total dumb ass. Bless you for putting up with me!)",0
"I started writing a post but before I was half way done with it was a wall of text. Ive got it typed up on google docs if anyone wants to see it Ill post it but Ill stick to bullet points. Supposed to graduate high school in 2004. Had to take an extra year due to being short a few credits. Delayed again when it came up I was short on classes that were not mentioned before. I delayed myself by another year (2006) by focusing on WoW rather then doing the 2 weeks worth of work to graduate. (2006)Wash dishes for a month and decide that I need to go back to school. Spend the next 4 years working only 2 years and always part time but part of it going to school. (2008) Stop going to school because my mom made to much by FAFSA standard even though she couldn't afford to help me with school. I have to wait until winter 2010 to go back. Unemployed for 2 years. Felt like killing myself several times for being worthless. Land a job at a mom and pops thanks to two guys from highschool. Work there part time, school full time for two years. Literally walked 2-2.25 miles to work and school everyday, uphill and downhill, and even in the snow on the rare occasions. Sometimes doing HW at work between class and work. Right before I graduate 1. Fafsa sends me more money because they had it laying around. Bought a car with it. 2. A local hospital lays off 100 employees in the field Im going into. Graduate, cant find a job in that field for two years. Stay at mom and pops making minimum wage for another 2-ish years but moving to head manager. Land a job at my current company $11.50/hour to $16.XX/hour. Start saving for a house. Car accident two years ago that wiped out the 5k I had started saving. Bought a new car but had car payments, silver lining - I learned I had high credit because I was approved for a $20k auto loan Buy a new car in September of 2015 with the assumption it will last for many years. Paid off new car Before Thanksgiving 2016. Small raise at work to $17.XX an hour. Sit down with my boss at lunch. Ask him ""whats the difference between my job (entry level) and (next step up?"" ""Nothing with everything you can do that's why Ill get you a big raise."" Currently - Boss got me the raise from $17.XX/h to $25/h. It came in on half my paycheck today. Checked bank balance - 18k saved at the moment. This time last year I paid off the 13k on my car.Ive stopped buying video games and comic books ($100 a month on comics alone not to mention bags, boards, and boxes) so not only will my raise be a nice boost but Ill keep some extra money. If I can keep saving like this I estimate that Ill be at 42k saved by the end of next year. That will be enough for a decent down payment on a house so I can finally move out of my moms house and live on my own at sadly 33 but better late then never.  -",0

"My girlfriend and I were eating at the food court and saw a guy in a wheelchair struggling to put condiments on his hot dog. He found a table to eat at and started eating right away. As we were leaving, My girlfriend realized he hasn't filled his cup, likely because he couldn't reach the machine. Being the amazing human being she is she said she was gonna help him get his drink. I beat her to it and walked up to the guy and offered to get him his drink. He said yes and I brought it back to him. He said thank you and asked me if I was religious, to which I replied not really. He smiled and said he hadn't eaten all day and that unfortunately he didn't have enough to get two hot dogs, that he'd give me the change he had if I wouldn't mind buying him another. I gave him a $5 bill and told him to get whatever he wanted. He smiled, shook my hand, asked me for my name, told me his, and said thank you. I left feeling a bit confused, he looked homeless. He had both legs amputated, and when I did speak to him I got the feeling he wasn't all there mentally. I felt a bit dumb for giving him the $5, thinking maybe he just played the victim card and got some money out of me. Besides I'm only just starting in my career and trying to save money so every dollar counts. But I realized that doesn't matter, what matters is that I did something good and it made me feel good. It made me happy to know that my girlfriend brings out something good in me, instead of being cynical about everything. Most of all, it made me happy I was in a position to help. I've been in situations where I've felt down and out, and I know just how much the kindness of a stranger can mean, no matter how small. I hope that the thoughts and doubts I had after are only the cynic in me acting up. But I feel happy knowing I helped someone, I don't get a lot of chances to help people and I always appreciate it when I do. I hope this doesn't come off as grandstanding, it just made my day today after a tough day and I hope me sharing it can bring a bit of brightness to yours. ",0

"We've been really close friends for a while now, talking each other through breakups and various issues. Lately, we've been hanging out at each other's places the past few weeks watching tv. It's always late when we hang out because she has rehearsals going on. Last night we decided to watch tv in my room because my roommate was using the living room.Nothing sexual happened, but it was nice to hold onto her and talk until we fell asleep. I honestly don't think I've ever been as happy in my entire life as I was waking up next to her. I can still smell her shampoo on my pillow. Now I just have to work up the nerve to ask her on a real date.",0
"I've always had a bit of a complex about how I think management views me in any job I've worked. In all of my long term jobs I've been regarded as a model employee. But despite that, I've been forced to just watch as countless people were promoted over me. As a teenager I was thrilled when McDonalds started grooming me to become a supervisor, but they would never commit to officially giving me the stripes, it was always something along the lines of ""you're just not ready yet"". Meanwhile some jerk comes in with a few months experience and gets the spot.Fast forward to today, I've been working at Tim Hortons for about 8 years now. It's been a lot of the same, I'm the superstar employee that is always overlooked when there's an opportunity for advancement. All of my supervisors were nowhere near as experienced and capable as I was at keeping the shift together when they got bumped up over me. It definitely stung, even though I just went along with it.Then suddenly 2 months ago everything changed. The restaurant manager (The main boss) just up and quit on pretty short notice. Plans for succession were all of a sudden in the works, while it was still unconfirmed who was getting it, there was a de facto leader everybody assumed was going to be it.To my surprise, the owner took me aside several days after the manager quit and offered to make me a supervisor. I said yes of course, and I went along my happy way, content with what I had been given. I respected my fellow supervisors for their experience, and defaulted to the de facto leader.Today was a shocker to everybody, I was once again pulled aside, this time I was given the manager position. I once again accepted, and the owner made the announcement that I am now in charge. I'm still in shock, I had some suspicions that I was going to be the one, but I don't think I ever let myself believe it. I know I deserve it more than anybody else, I just never expected somebody would ever be willing to take a leap of faith with me. ",0

"4 years ago, I finally got my license at the age of 18. And then I didn't drive again until this year, because I was terrified.

Driving my sister around town, even drove for the first time alone a few weeks ago. What a rush.Today is a big day for me. After waking up to drive my sister to work, I drove around a bit.

"I was having dinner with my boyfriend after work, just relaxing. The conversation turned to our past love lives, or lack thereof. He mentioned how it sucked because girls he was interested in never reciprocated and girls he didn't like would ask him out.I was surprised because he's smart, handsome, fit, and a very talented singer, who wouldn't want to date him? He told me he didn't date those girls because he was picky. I asked him, ""Oh whoa, then why did you date me? "" He looked straight at me and sincerely said, ""because  I'm picky"".Now I don't have the most self confidence. I have just come to internalize that he's always been too good for me and when I heard his answer I was genuinely happy and started tearing up in the restaurant. He saw my reaction and started tearing up as well. I don't know where else to post this I'm just seriously happy right now from my conversation this evening.",0

"I was in a not-at-fault accident just under a year ago and I've been struggling with memory ever since. My short term memory was awful, I forgot all of my friend's names, and it feels like I lost an entire year of school between the accident right before finals and struggling to remember new information. Professor pity and some doctor's notes got me through last winter's finals, and last semester was just me coasting through school and hoping that luck would carry me. It was absolutely horrible, and even though my marks were really good, I felt like I should've taken the year off because of the stress and self-doubt. I honestly told people around me that I felt retarded in the medical sense... slowed down, stupid, useless, and thinking like I was back in grade school and lost all my process from high school onward. I had to re-learn how to do basic math despite acing calculus in my first year of university, I had to re-learn all of my old courses based on old notes, and I spent more all-night study sessions in the living room than I care to admit because I completely lost my ability to focus. But the worst one, I think, was the first time I saw my friends after an accident and realized I didn't know what a single one was named. One of them even had the same first name as me and I had no idea. They tried to lighten the situation and poke fun at it, but I left crying. That came right after my make-up exams and it was the exact moment I realized how much I'd lost.Well, I'm approaching the one year mark, it's a whole new semester, I just finished my midterms... and I finally feel confident again! I'm able to go into midterms feeling pretty good and I'm getting A's in everything! I'm still struggling with self-doubt, but so far it's all been going fine. I'm not having nearly as much trouble understanding lectures in real-time, my courses are making sense even though they're harder, and I'm actually having motivation to do my work during daylight hours, which is huge. It's still a really big struggle to get anything done before sunset, and I'm still having a lot of moments where I forget how to talk for a bit, but I'm honestly doing so much better, and it's wonderful. I'm remembering things so much more than I'm forgetting them now. There was a long time where I wondered if I'd ever see this again. And it's right now. I never thought I'd be able to take something as simple as short-term memory for granted, but I never will again!Another good thing... I got all those names back. I had to re-learn them, but I think I might even have a better grip on them now than I did before. :)",0

"A little backstory: I deal with pretty severe mental illness and went from Ultra Smart Golden Child to nearly dropping out of high school with no college prospects. I've been trudging my way through fast food, trying to save up for college but barely scraping through bills.A month ago on a whim I decided to send my resume to a local restaurant. Through amazingly good timing, the owner/chef was desperate for a new line cook and gave me a shot despite my utter lack of culinary experience.Now I work full-time as a line cook and I couldn't ask for a better job. I love what I do so freaking much, I love the people I work with, I love everything. I'm actually respected here, and he listens to my opinions and actually cares about what I have to offer. I have freedom to explore, learn, and be creative. I learn so many new things every day. Last week, he took me and another of the kitchen staff (there's only ~5 of us) out to dinner after a long day. He's welcomed me into his family and I feel so at home there. I never thought something this amazing would happen to me. I wake up every day excited to go to work and learn more. I get to end my days by hanging out with my coworkers, eating great food and playing games and just bonding. Life is just like a dream right now and after so many years of struggle and failure it's just so mind-blowing that I'm here.",0

The past few years were pretty depressing for me and, as a result, I took a few years off from running/exercising. Well, I decided to get back into running last week and last night, I beat my personal best with a time of 8:29. It's not a fantastic run time by any means, but it is the fastest I've ever run.

"Doesn't matter what it was about, it's the type that isn't easy. You know the ones, where no one wants to address it but you both know it's there and can't be ignored.We sat on opposite couches and fiddled with our phones for a while, waiting for the other to speak. And finally someone did.And so we talked. We laid out our innermost feelings that are usually only acknowledged by yourself and perhaps a diary. Our hopes and insecurities, our love for each other and commitment to making things work.There was nothing bad about what happened. It was constructive and difficult but we came out all the stronger for it. Love is work, to paraphrase a wonderful post I saw on reddit years ago: it's a conscious effort to wake up every morning and say I am going to work for not only myself but my person as well. There are no fairy tales or soul mates and people will be people, with poor communication or lack of it entirely being what I believe is the principle divide.I want to emphasize that I have a wonderful relationship and feel loved and supported and do my best to reciprocate or outdo what I receive. The feeling of handling an adult conversation like adults and being able to say ""I love and appreciate you, we'll do better"" at the end of it is an amazing feeling of success. She makes every day a bit more worth it and I am so very fortunate.And so today, more so than others, I am very happy.",0

"So, yeah, I'm really feeling it today, and in all honesty, why is that abnormal? I mean, can we just take a moment to appreciated the fact that we're sitting on a little rock in space, yet there just so happens to be so much to love about it? Like, seriously, we get to make art, we get to enjoy music, we get to tell jokes, to laugh at jokes, to eat ice cream, to drink water, to feel the breeze, to see the sunset, to have friends, to ask a random person on the street for a high-five and probably get one, to think, to do whatever the hell makes us happy! For god's sake, we have birds! BIRDS! Just these things with feathers that fly around and sing! That's just there for us to enjoy! You ever seen a person with a nice smile? Why do smiles exist? What are the odds that something capable of smiling just happened to develop naturally in some weird rock moving around a ball of fire? Why are we not all smiling all the time?

[Boom!](https://cdn.decoist.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Small-cowboy-themed-Christmas-tree-with-hat.jpg) Why does that picture exist? Because the human race is delightfully off its absolute, ever-loving, monkey-brained fucking rocker, and if we want a cowboy hot on a Christmas tree, we're damn well going to get a motherfucking cowboy hat on a motherfucking Christmas tree, and it'll be the cutest damn thing ever to bless your stupidly beautiful eyes, because seriously, have you ever seen an eye that wasn't fucking gorgeous? Eyes, man! Looking at eyes is reason enough alone to stay alive! So, listen up: next time you feel shit, just keep in mind that none of this - NONE of this - ever had to come about, but it did, and now you're at the culmination of 13.772 billion years of development, and you get to look at eyes!So, sadness, you cowardly piece of shit, listen to my words, and quake in your stupid, ugly boots: life is fucking incredible, and you can just suck my dick!

"I know that rats, even pet rats, are a bit of an acquired taste, but I love their mammoth-sized personalities contained in a pint sized rodent body so please have an open mind if you choose to check out the video I want to share with you all. Rats don't live very long (2-3 years is the average in the UK), but they have a habit of forming a close bond with their owners which they later break when they pass on. We choose to rescue two rats, and I'm determined to make their short little lives full of adventure. They don't know what halloween is, but they sure enjoyed exploring the haunted mansion I made for them out of cardboard (featured as a background prop in the video.)After we had some leftover pumpkin; I had planned on just giving it to them for their dinner when I remembered a hamster-friendly pumpkin pie recipe I'd found on youtube. So there I was, mixing flour and peanut butter and rolling it into a pie shape, filling it with some mashed pumpkin then using a chopstick to stab a smiley face into the top (they're fearless, there was no point in a spooky face). I baked it and once cooled offered it to the ratties as a treat during their free range time.They loved it and kept trying to steal it from me; I've never had to wrestle food from my girl, Nova, so much!

"The last two years have been so insanely good, and it feels important to take stock in it and do some appreciating of it. Two years ago I married my internet friend of eight years and moved to Europe. I've made friends, I'm learning the language, my husband and I have a full and loving relationship! I absolutely love and appreciate this new country, and I make sure to think about that every day on my way to school, which I get paid for going to. I was overweight while living in the US, and had gained 10 more lbs since being in Europe. I got really really sick of it, I lost 60 lbs in 6 months and I've never felt better about myself! I'm this new woman whose bras fit and thighs don't rub!I got a contract with a global shoe company for proofreading! It's so so exciting to get working and contribute a bit more to our bank account!AND the icing on the cake is the most recent good news! The same shoe company asked me to do a few drawings for the next journal set to come out. I did a watercolor of the plant they were looking for and it got the green light! My watercolor will have its own full page in a magazine translated into 17 languages with a run of more than 100,000 going all over the world! When I got the news I started laugh crying so hard I almost couldn't breathe. I've never had so much exposure for anything, I'm still gushing with happiness and gratitude! Things are just going so well, and I don't even wanna complain a little!",0
"I'm 23 and I have NEVER run a mile without stopping in my entire life. I'm on the fifth week of the Couch to 5K which requires you to run 20 minutes without stopping. I actually totaled 1.8 miles in 20 mins, so an 11 minute pace. I'm over the moon!! Never in my life did i think i would be able to do this. I'm so excited for next week to keep training and run even farther!! ",0

"Today is the first day in 7 years of depression and depersonalization that I can say I'm happy I never killed myself. It's been on my mind for ages, and I've always asked myself if I'm glad I never did it. The answer was always ""no"". Today I'm glad I never went through with it. I want my life to get better and look up.I've struggled with DPDR, anxiety, depression, insecurities, and suicidal thoughts since I was 13. Today, I'm happy. Cheers everyone.",0
"In 2014 I dated a guy for about 10 months. The reason we broke up seemed so silly in hindsight; it was something we could've easily worked through it together. He was such a good guy, we really clicked on a personal level and I always regretted the relationship ending. A month or two ago, I found out through a friend that he was single. Today I worked up the courage to text him out of the blue and ask him to go for a coffee date - and he said YES!I don't want to get too far head of myself, but I'm just so happy that I get to see him again and catch up. We're meeting up on Sunday - wish me luck! :)",0
"I've been on Facebook since I was 12. It just used to be a way for me to play games while not contaminating my mom's Facebook.Then over the years it involved into something I was always on. Dependent on even. It was quite scary how much time I spent on that site. I turn 20 in a month, and I've been very reflective lately with how I want to welcome my new decade of life, and I realized that I want to welcome it with happiness, and peace within myself, and I wasn't getting that by being attached to Facebook 24/7. I was more stressed than anything. Now I feel free and peaceful and truly happy. I've set out to try new hobbies, get creative again, read more often, do photography again. Hobbies and things I used to enjoy that got sucked away from all the time I spent on Facebook. Just my little ramble. (I got rid of snapchat too, I hated that app) ",0
"Seven years ago, back in high school, I would normally draw or paint for people: portraits mostly. And usually for people that I admired or liked.That year, I had made a painting for a high school crush/friend for Christmas. It was a painting of a giraffe (a nickname she would sometimes call herself), on a yellow background (her favourite colour), and walking on a rainbow floor. Inside the frame I had written a lengthy note about our friendship. One that I considered would never actually be read, but at the time I felt it was necessary to add. To be completely honest, I can not recall a single word of what I wrote those many years ago.We haven't spoken to each other for seven years, but still were facebook friends and followed each other on instagram. I can't say if the note was ever read. But tonight she posted a picture of her room on instagram, and in the background was the painting. I would have expected her to have thrown it out by now, since we haven't spoken in seven years. But knowing the fact that she actually kept it for so long without us being part of each other's lives for seven years makes me very happy. It just made me feel nice to know that I might have positively affected someone else's life, or that she actually appreciated the painting enough to have kept it.",0

"Lately our puppy seems like she knows I'm having nightmares. She comes up in the morning to snuggle with me and my fiance, but in the mornings after he leaves for work I've been having a lot of bad dreams lately. The past few of them, the puppy has been snuggling so close to me I think trying to wake me up, like she's cuddling me back to comfort. I want to cry with how sweet this dog is. I've had plenty of dogs my whole life but none have ever been so intuitive as she is.",0
"I've been so overworked and had the worst week. My boyfriend decided to come visit me (lives 6 hours away) and I literally can't wait to see his face. I think we might watch Hulu all weekend and cook pasta, but it sounds perfect. The weekend is almost here!",0
"I was told as soon as I started university that it was impossible to find relevant biology co-op jobs and that I was basically screwed. Having zero past experience in a lab setting and this being my first work term, I had all but accepted that I was going to end up unemployed this winter. Well, after 3 stressful interviews with different companies, offers went out today and I ended up receiving an offer for my first choice job (out of over 100 applicants)!! I get to work in a lab as a research assistant and learn about all sorts of molecular biology techniques and help conduct research that matters in a field I'm really interested in! This is such a weight off my chest and I'm so excited to start working :)",0
"So, I'm a college student taking Chinese along with the rest of my engineering classes. All my classes are tough, but Chinese goes fast. Really fast. We learn about 20 to 40 characters a week and are tested often. To keep up, I regularly put in half an hour to an hour and a half a day, partly to keep up and partly because I enjoy it.I went to talk to the professor about continuing classes in Mandarin, he told me that I was a good student, that he could see I put in the time, and that he was disappointed at times when he could see most of the students just shrugged it off as a humanities credit. For reference, this teacher never does anything but smile, he's the happiest person I know.For him to have noticed me in particular just made my week. It's wonderful, both to know my work isn't in vain, and to slowly be able to puzzle out basic Chinese sentences.I hope this wasn't too bragging-y, this just brightened an otherwise rather dull week.",0
One of my best friend's awesome girlfriend had thier baby a few days ago. They had a previous miscarriage and we're both overjoyed at this pregnancy. Mama felt something was wrong and went to the hospital and saved her baby's life as something was seriously wrong. One more day or so and it would been a different story.I'm so freaking happy for them ,0
I am beyond happy. I have stressed for months over college applications and finally this morning at 1am I submitted my first application. Its early action but the road only gets easier from here since I have all the basics done. So now goodnight but man Im so happy. ,0
"I have been on tinder for a couple of years. I have gone through phases of usage with the app, usually a week or two of diligent swiping, but usually I go weeks without opening the app.A month or so ago I got a notification saying that a girl had super liked me. If readers are unaware, you swipe up for a super like, instead of the usual left and right. This happens more often as a mistake from exiting detailed views of users profiles, at least more often in my experience. I ignored this super like. That was a mistake. A few weeks later, I thought, what the hell, Ill give it shot, Im desperate. I sent her a message apologizing for not getting back to her sooner, and explaining that I dont check the app very often. To my astonishment, she actually replied and understood. It turns out she was a genuine super like. We started talking, and things progressed from there. I added her on Snapchat, and after talking on that, I got the nerve to ask for her number. She gave it to me without hesitation. We texted, and things went deeper.After two days of texting, I had had enough. I told her Im smitten with her, and if she wants me, Im hers. She said she does, and I couldnt be happier. Weve been texted all day everyday. The best part? Shes damn gorgeous and thinks Im handsome. Shes kind, sweet, and has a beautiful smile. The bad part? She lives three hours away. Some day we are going to meet in person, and that day is going to change my life. I love you Mariah. You mean the world to me. ",0

Dad and I kind of just drifted over the years and I held some animosity toward him because of it. But weve been talking a lot lately - settled our differences - and are closer than ever. Im really happy about it ,0
"I didn't think it was possible after a series of terrible relationships, but I really feel happy about this. I would be okay even if it didn't go anywhere long term, but it's given me hope that someone out there exists for me. We seem to get along so well you could call it eerie. Everything seems to flow naturally from conversation to kissing. I asked him out expecting all the worst possibilities, but I never thought to consider what good could come out of it. I barely know the guy considering I met him in a random encounter. I don't know how to feel yet, but I feel a strength of spirit that I haven't in a long time thanks to this. I am more capable of overcoming my depression and anxiety easier thanks to this random blessing. I don't believe in any gods, but fate has given me a small present. Whatever it is I feel grateful. I am not used to being happy and this feels like a small miracle.",0
It wasn't cheap but I got to be home for the first time in 9 months to see her get married and I also saw my brother who I hadn't seen in almost a year and some other family members I haven't seen in even longer!,0
"I had a long term crush on this good friend of mine. She's wicked smart, goal oriented, fun, and just absolutely beautiful. I've known her for a solid 4 years now, and I knew I was not her type based on the guys she's been with previously. I obviously did not want to make things weird between us since I would rather have a friendship with her than nothing at all, so I never said anything. Then, one night, when we were both getting drinks with friends, she kissed me! Ever since then, I could not be happier. I take my GRE next week, I'm in my last year of college, and super stressed every week, but I'm typing this as she's sleeping right next to me, so life is not as bad as it seems. She's my best friend and I love her ",0
"This was a few weeks ago, but I finally got around to watching all six ""Star Wars"" movies all the way through (I know there are seven now, but I'm talking about George Lucas's films). I saw them in chronological order, not release order--I started with Episode One and ended with Six. To me, it was more of a story about a family than anything, which I thought was wonderful. All these years I was led to believe that they were hardcore science films, the kind where emotion was scarcely visible and had to be scoured for, but I was so wrong. The conversation between Padme and Anakin in the end of Episode Three (you fans know what I'm talking about) made my heart ache; I had to take a break before I saw Episode Four. I'm just relieved I got to appreciate such an awesome movie series before I turned 20.",0

"I never saw myself coming this far! I got married at a young age (19) and was happy, until a guy I worked with decided to go full creep and followed me home, threatened my life and really just.. did too much. My husband at the time couldn't handle any of it and left me, broken and scared. This was 6 years ago, for the past two years I've been with an amazing guy I met through Tinder (I know right? Thank goodness I got lucky) and I never imagined I would make it this far in life! I thought I could never be happy again after everything, and he's an insane blessing. I hope everyone is having a wonderful of day as I am <3 ",0
"For starters this happen very recently (last Tuesday to be exact). Im a flooring installer, I work for a subcontractor, and overall I have good weeks and bad ones. This week was the best I had ever made, I got paid (I get paid a percentage, so I get paid in cash, pay my own taxes at the end of the year as most people in my line of work are 1099 by the Subcontractor) on my way home from work I stopped by a grocery store gas station and grabbed milk for my kid and pumped gas.Apparently I either dropped my wallet from my pocket, or laid it in my car through the window and it fell out when I opened the door, really Im not sure. I left and didnt notice it was gone till about 30 minutes later when I went to pay a bill and the wallet wasnt in my pocket... at which I drove back to the store (about 15 mins down the road) and the attendant told me someone had turned in the wallet to lost and found... I checked lost and found, it wasnt there...I filed a police report, tried everything I could to find the wallet, waited at the store for 2 hours, when I get a phone call from a company we occasionally do flooring for, telling me this gentleman is trying to find me to turn in my wallet. When I meet with him the entire paycheck was in there.My current financial situation is grim, Im litterally living paycheck to paycheck (this week I made 250.00) if this gentleman decided to keep my money, Im not sure what I would have done, Im on the verge of getting evicted, it was my rent, and food, and gas for the week... This gentleman really saved me, Im not a religious person but Im really thankful that there are some good honest people out here still.",0

"Forgive me for this long text and for my english as it might have a lot of mistakes.I started working at this company last year (1 year and 6 months now) and it was just the usual depressing factory job. Past 6 months, after a lot of trouble trying to click with the person I was working with (he was very difficult to work with, especially with people who were beginners), I asked my team leader if it was possible to change places and have another task.There was one. Probably the most physical job in the whole company. You literally had to walk 15Km or 9 miles for my American friends, everyday. At least that was my average. Carry hundreds of containers everyday. Containers weighing from 10Kgs to 15Kgs (22lbs to 33lbs). Working 6 days straight. 7 days straight once a month. The schedule changes every week. One week 08:00 - 16:00, the next 16:00 - 00:00 and the next 00:00 - 08:00 and repeat. My arms have ""black marks"" (I don't know what to call it but, it's that mark you get after your muscle gets injured and becomes yellowish, sometimes purple) from carrying stuff around and can't seem to lose them as I really don't have enough time off work for them to heal completely. My hands are not pretty even though I use gloves most of the time. My back hurts, my legs too. Sometimes, exhaustion, ironically, doesn't let me sleep. Even though it was difficult, I gave it my all every single day. They needed someone for extra hours, I was there. They needed someone for the heavy lifting, I was there. Someone to work on day offs, I was there. I sacrificed a lot on a personal level to be able to work and provide for my parents. After all this time, I started thinking if all this hard work would lead me somewhere and kept imaginating scenarios. But the reality was, with my level of education, I was probably condemned to be doing this job for my whole life as in every job offer the company had, you needed to be an engineer to be able to climb through the ranks. Honestly, I didn't want that for me, so I seriously started thinking about finding another job. Yesterday, after my lunch break finished, I went back to work. As of minutes, I see my two team leaders approaching me and telling me that they needed to talk with me. I said sure, without any idea what was coming my way. I just thought they had a task for me and wanted to explain it to me. I followed them and I see them entering the meeting room and my immediate thought was ""Shit shit shit, am I getting fired, did I fuck up somewhere?"" I don't know why did I think this as I knew I had done nothing wrong, but that was all I could think. After a brief silence, they start telling me that all year long, they have noticed how hard I've worked and how dedicated to my job I am, how passioned... At this point, all I'm thinking is ""Is this happening? What in the blue hell is happening?"" They kept telling me that I was a very good worker and that I was very dedicated, etc etc. I just wanted them to go straight to the point!!  After all this, they said it. ""We're offering you a new position."" I started stuttering A LOT (not a good first impression, I know), but I knew I had to be calm and composed so I, successfully, tried my hardest. They gave me a brief description of the position they were offering and how serious it was, if I was ready for the new resposabilities and so on. After thinking about everything they said, I accepted! They did congratulate me and told me to not ever think that hard work goes unnoticed. They still didn't know when I'm going to start with my new tasks as they still had to communicate with their higher ups that I had accepted the offer. Then they said ""That's all"" and I asked if could get back to work.After I left the room, my legs and hands were shacking HARD. I never thought this would be possible. I went to the bathroom, called my parents to tell the news and god, were they happy.  I can't wait to start and I've never been so motivated to work again. All because now I know that all that hard work wasn't for nothing.I just want to add up that if you're in a similair situation, don't give up. There's almost always someone watching your hardwork, and even if that hard work doesn't get you higher, just be happy for yourself because you gave it your best shot.Thanks for reading and have a good day!",0

"2013: I met my best friend online, over 1,000 miles away from me. I fell in love with her, and somehow convinced her to take a chance on me. We kept up a long-distance relationship for almost a year before meeting.2014: I got picked for an amazing, very well-paid internship at the company Id always dreamed of working for. In addition, I got to live rent-free by house-sitting for a multi-millionaire the entire summer I was at the internship.At the end of the internship, I was offered an incredible job, which I was to start January 5, 2015, two weeks after I graduated. I was elated.Plot Twist - a huge management layoff occurred, and I was laid off before ever starting, on December 20, 2014. My old Director and I had become friends, and he sent out a recommendation letter as soon as he heard what happened, and less than 4 hours after being laid off, I got offered a job from a consultant Id worked with, which had the exact same pay, and I didnt even have to interview. I graduated in December 2014 with my Bachelors in Biology and a Minor in Environmental Sustainability.2015: I moved to a new state and got my first apartment on January 9, right on a lake with a wrap-around balcony and awesome fishing. Two days later, my then-girlfriend traveled over 1,000 miles to move in with me. Id never been so happy. In addition, my wifes parents are some of my favorite people. No jokes, no sarcasm, I have the best in-laws in the world.I started my new, job on January 19, 2015, and even got a corner office since one was available. By the end of the year, I got my performance review... out of 5, 3 was meets all expectations. I got a 5, a personal review from our regional manager that put all of my scores higher than my self review, and a great raise.During the year, my wife and I traded my truck and her car and bought a car together, which Id been told by my family Id never be able to afford for at least 5 years.By May, I proposed on the spot my wife and I first met, and we were married by October 2015. We had an incredibly small wedding, nestled in the most beautiful little town Ive ever seen, right in the heart of the mountains in east Tennessee.During the year, we met an awesome couple and have been great friends ever since. In addition, we lost my wifes dog, but adopted a beautiful border collie/Lab mix named Lady, who is the most gentle, loveable dog imaginable.On top of all this... Im adopted, and without me knowing, my amazing wife somehow tracked down my biological mother, who turned out to be a veritable saint. Shes one of the greatest people Ive ever met, married to a man Im honored to know, both of whom immediately became a permanent part of our lives. Thats a story in itself.There were times that first year that were hard - our apartment looked amazing at first and turned into a horror show (so many stories about it), we had medical issues and at one time, had $0.38 to our name, as well as my adoptive family rejecting us entirely. Id do it all over again.2016: In February, my wife and I began trying for a kid, and to our eternal surprise, she got pregnant within 2 weeks. Plot twist - wed moved to a new apartment two months before, and about the time we found out my wife was pregnant, we found out our neighbor was stalking us. Terrifying time, so many stories.We finally move out of that apartment and away from our stalker, into a brand new, gorgeous apartment that was finished 3 days before we actually moved in.November - our son, James, is born on 11/11/16. He was born early, and was a lil fella, but was the greatest thing to ever happen to us. Im so proud of my son I cant stand it, and my wifes calling in life is to be a mother. Im humbled daily by how amazing of a mother she is.2017: In March, we drove from Florida to Iowa to visit where my wife grew up and where her brothers still live. It was a great time. Two weeks later, we find out that my brother-in-law and his wife were approved to adopt a beautiful baby girl, after trying for 5-10 years to have a child. She was adopted from Florida, so they were able to stay with us for a few days after leaving the hospital with her, and theyre both such incredible parents.In three weeks, were celebrating my sons first birthday, and its unbelievable how fast this year has gone by.I end this by say that these have been the hardest, most challenging years of my life. There have been so many crazy and tough moments that werent mentioned (which I can share if anybody wants to know). But more importantly, there have been an abundance of truly incredible moments, as many peaks as valleys, and with that, I am content. ",0

"Im just so happy about the seemingly little things in life. It was highlighted today when I was putting away the groceries. It made me think of all these things. Like coming into your house when its cold outside and feeling the burst of indoor warmth squeeze you. Having a couch to sit on, and a variety of snack options in my kitchen. Having lights at night, running water in multiple rooms of the house, and a phone on which I can speak to my grandkids any time I want. Im so grateful to be in a comfortable financial situation. We cant leap up and decide to buy a new car without careful consideration and planning, but things like noticing the cutting boards have gotten grungy. I can go right out and replace them! I can take my kids out for ice cream or call in a pizza when Im too tired to cook. When its raining or hot or cold or windy or gloomy, I can be inside a temperature controlled space on a comfy seat and I have the autonomy to do whatever I please. I can knit, I can take a nap, I can watch the Home shopping network for 24 hours straight if I want! I am at a wonderful time in life and couldnt be more content with the decisions Ive made that led to this point. ",0
"I love baseball but I have had to miss watching many World Series in the last several years due to class/work. The games always started after I had to be there and ended before I could get home. My family was really low tech so once all the VCRs broke I had no way to record a game and watch it later.I now have a real job and can afford a DVR in my apartment. I had to miss the World Series Game 1 today due to work, but I am watching it right now on my DVR and getting to experience it as if I was watching it live! This is awesome! It makes me so happy!",0

If I created an RPG game where you create a character, and can level up the character by completing tasks that make you happier (such as meditation, deep breathing etc.), would you play it?

"Heya r/happy I am usually more of a lurker (mainly cause my english needs some work, but also because I often times felt like what I had to say was not relevant) but today I want to break out of my lurker shell. I went through quite a long phase of feeling depressed and like I had no energy. But today I think I might've fallen in love again which has not happened for a long time. Now I haven't even told her yet and I don't even know if it is going to work out ( hope I am not jinxing it with this post ), but I am feeling like a million bucks right now.  For the first time since ( at least what it feels like ) forever I feel like I can do the things I want to do and achieve the goals I've set for myself. And the problems that I am struggling with don't seem that big anymore. And even if it won't work out in the end, I am grateful to just feel like this once again. Just thought I would share this with you, and anyone out there who is stuck in a terrible spot at the moment... I know it might sounds like it is completely out of reach but just don't give up on everything. I never suspected that I would be someone to post on here, actually if you would've told me something like this maybe 3 weeks ago I would've just said "" ehh.. that is easy to say for you "" but please trust me when I say something someday will cheer you up and make you feel happy again and every shitty day you have got to endure is worth it!

"STORY TIMEOk it may not sound like much to a lot of yall but to me this is a 12 year goal finally completed. Bad in 2nd grade I decided that I wanted to be an Infantryman in the Army, and since then that has been my goal. When I was a Freshman in high school I was told I had congenital lobar emphazyma and that one third of my right lung had to be removed. No biggie right? Wrong. Little did I know that the military considers that to be and automatic disqualifier, meaning I couldn't join, but I did not care. My senior year of high school I applied to the University of North Georgia and their ROTC program and i was accepted. Having not forgot about my original goal, in the summer between my senior year of high school and my freshman year of college i walked into the recruiting office at the local recruiting depot with the goal of enlisting. More on that later. My first semester of college went ok, got a 2.6 GPA but wasn't too happy there. Second semester was horrible, 1.6 GPA and miserable the entire time, and all the while trying to figure out my enlistment paperwork and the headache that was caused by my lung surgery. After my freshman year of college i decided that college isn't for me right now, so I dropped out, still continuing the goal I set back in second grade. Come around a month ago things really started to pickup in my enlistment process. I was approved to go to MEPS, however, me and my recruiter both knew I would ""fail, meaning the doctor there would fail me and require me to get a medical waiver. I went, and by the stroke of god that is exactly what happened. So after that my recruiter was finally able to submit my medical waiver (to the Army this means, if approved, it's as if my surgery never happened) but these kinds of waivers are very rarely approved. 3 days ago he submitted it and told me it was no longer in his hands and we juat had to play the waiting game, which could very well take months. As of 3 hours prior to writing this I got a call from my recruiter as I'm sitting at my desk playing games with my friends. I pick up the phone and this is what follows. R ""Hey man I got some news for you, they denied your waiver."" Me ""Fuck man, now what do we do."" Recruiter ""Nah man I'm just fucking with you, they approved your waiver and you're all set to join the military."" At this point I leap out of my chair and run out of my room to tell my parents I'm going to join the military. Oh, I'm also balling my eyes out at this point from excitement and reliefe. We talk some more and in two weeks I will be signing my contract to officially join the US Army. Sorry for the long ass story but I really felt I had to get this out. Now marks hour 3 that I have had a smile on my face. Yall have a great day, thanks for reading. ",0
My boyfriend and I had a bit of a fight kinda thing because of some shitty stuff I did. I love him so much and knowing I hurt him made me feel worse than I ever have. I felt so guilty and so unworthy of his love. The last thing I ever want to do is hurt him in any way. But he was so understanding about everything and he kept reassuring me that it was all okay. We had a thorough conversation about what happened and I've never felt more loved in my entire life. I feel like I don't deserve him. He's more than the best partner I ever could have asked for. He means the world to me and he makes me feel so happy. So I'm going to spend the rest of my life trying to make him as incredibly happy as he makes me. ,0
"I'm 24 years old and I've been off and on with this girl since I've been about 21. Long story short the last 3 years have been SO draining that almost every aspect of my life had lost its zest literally. It's been a month now and my life immediately took a turn for the better. I even appreciate color, sound, smell, feeling and taste so much more. Not to mention all of the great things in life I still haven't experienced.I'm noticing even a day at home with a cup of tea on a rainy day by the window is such a blessingThe present moment is so much more immersive, I'm enjoying my family so much more, I have so much more TIME on my hands! My creative endeavors are in full bloom, I just see possibility rather than wondering when the next argument is going to occur or whatever. Lol The best part about it is I hold no resentment for her, I still really love her and wish her the best.I feel like I've been reborn!!! Thanking God / The Universe / The architect, whatever force that created this realm of reality, for every moment and cherishing the present! ",0

I was originally not going to take it because everyone said not to since no one ever got an A over the years and over half of the class were getting F's.

"I decided I needed an outlet to help with my depression but regular journaling doesn't work for me so I decided to make a no rules digital journal in indesign and I'm loving it! I'm also realising it's helping me grow as a graphic designer because I can just do whatever I want without the fear someone will dislike my layouts! And when I'm feeling bad it often helps because I end up wanting to try to make the page reflect my mood which churns up my creativity and gets me thinking about other projects I'd like to take on.It's so freeing having a journal I can do whatever I want with. I found bullet journaling alluring but I eventually gave up because it simply took too long to format my pages. Now I can add elements from bullet journaling, regular journaling, mood boards and general graphic design to create something I'm really enjoying and proud of creating that's truly helping my emotional state.",0
"Just wanted to share how ecstatic I feel right now. Last year was a pretty low point in my life. My girlfriend of two years cheated on me, engineering was getting difficult and to cope with it I started doing more drugs. On top of everything I had severe anxiety. By the end of the semester I failed two classes and received a 1.0 gpa. I had to send an appeal to come back to school. I felt like I was a piece of shit.After coming back I wanted to take back control of my life. I started getting more help in my classes and went to mental health counseling. Failing helped me find value in my education and myself. It was the first time I ever felt true failure. And because of it I ended up with a 3.67 gpa for last Spring. So now Im happily single, on my way to being clean and keeping my grades up. Its not something I talk to people about but I figured Ill finally start talking about it. Cause one thing I want people to understand is that its okay to fail as long as you own up to it and learn from it. ",0
He lives an hour away and our schedules clash a lot so I haven't seen him in a month. But he surprised me at school today! I told him my last class was cancelled and he drove all the way out to see me just for the tree hours I had until work. I'm so lucky,0
"I live alone with two cats, one 2 years old and one 5 month old kitten. A couple months ago [my 2 year old cat](http://i.imgur.com/9ZoXCSb.jpg) was very sick. His liver was failing and he hadn't eaten food in over a month, despite me trying everything either I or my vet could think of.We then put a feeding tube in, which was a really hard decision to make as I didn't want to make him suffer for no reason, since they didn't know why his liver was failing and he had some other issues going on as well.I fed him via the tube 3 times a day for 4 weeks or so. It was a lot of work as it took around 45 minutes to feed him his food and medicine. Combine that with working 9 or 10 hours a day and suddenly needing to work from home for a month in order to take care of him, it was very stressful. A couple weeks ago he finally started really improving, so much so that he started eating again on his own! His personality has completely come back. He is doing things that I forgot he did. The way he likes to nibble on my knuckles, or meow angrily when the AC turns on, or lay on my desk and put his paw on my hand when I am working. I am taking him in to the vet in a couple days to get his feeding tube removed. I am so happy this turned out well.",0
"There's a lot to explain here but I'll try to stick to the main details.I'm a bisexual woman, and yesterday I was hanging out with a very very good friend of mine who is also a bisexual woman. I'm super attracted to her and have been ever since we met 4 years ago. She finds me attractive as well and compliments me regularly, and will sometimes joke about doing more-than-friendly things with me, but she's never made any kind of moves. I always just assumed her attraction to me was purely aesthetic and was just being an encouraging friend because that's just how close we are, you know? So I never made any moves, because who wants to be that person to make things weird with a good friend?But yesterday, as we were hanging out at my place, there was just a really intimate vibe between us throughout the day, and we made casual affectionate contact a lot more than we usually do. But again, we're already very close so I didn't want to read too much into it. As I was driving her home, she basically confessed to me that she actually would be perfectly fine if something intimate happened between us. I wasn't even fully recovered from hearing that before she gently kissed me before we said goodbye. I've wanted to kiss her forever and it's finally happened. I'm just so stoked.I guess I'm still like riding the emotional high and I wanted to tell someone super super badly. So I thought maybe some of you wouldn't mind hearing my dumb ramblings. Anyway, just something really nice that happened to me that I wanted to share.",0

"I've never posted to r/happy before, only scrolled and been inspired, but finally today I feel halfway worthy of posting. An attempt at quick background:  All my life I have been fascinated by medicine and science but always assumed I wasn't smart enough to be a real doctor, typically scoring average or only a little above average. About 4 years ago after my first year in undergrad I had a drastic change of attitude and decided I will never be what I want I don't try... I am currently on my 5th and final year of my Biology degree with all additional credits for both the MCAT and required by US medical schools. I struggled and literally scraped by all the chemistries, re taking general 2 and organic 1 twice. I got an academic scholarship to an out of state school so there I went, only to find out that the scholarship only lasted 4 years. This year I am full out of state tuition, and I ALMOST had to transfer back into my state for only  my final year, which would completely change where my degree was from, even if I went to USC for 4 of 5 years. Due to some amount of privilege I am ever grateful for, my parents are just barely able to financially support me through my last year in combination with some student loans, but it HAD to be my last year (of undergraduate).Alongside these facts my final requirement for the MCAT and medical school (other than highly specific biology courses to finish my major) is the notorious physics class I am in now, the physics of electricity, magnetism and optics. Again I must re iterate friends I am no genius, in fact I often feel like I'm pretending among other really smart people, but this course wasn't an option if I want to even apply to medical school. So I go to class, take notes etc, read the text book, all normal requirements, and I got a whopping 3 points on my first exam. For writing my name correctly, impressive. Come one month later my second exam is coincidentally timed to be on the exact date (today) that my university has declared the cut off date to drop a course with out WF- which is basically quitting halfway through with out failing, but you get no money back. This course alone out of state ran me over 3 grand. I studied so long and so hard but I was sooo nervous I had no idea how it went. There was even a small riot at the end of the exam, people demanding we get out scores before the cut off date. It seemed like everything was on the line... This evening my poor friend I studied with texted me and said, the scores are up, I got a 3 again, I have to drop. I knew I was fucked, this guy was so organized compared to me, scatter brained and freaking out. I got an 82 on the exam!!! I really got a B on this exam. I just want to cry. Everything seems to be okay again, and the delayed gratification combined with surprising myself is the sweetest satisfaction I can possibly think of in this moment. I hope anyone reading this (and anyone in general) has had a happy day as well, and if not there is tomorrow, there is always tomorrow!!",0
"I just started University a few weeks back and I've had a tough time making friends but we just went on this trip to Wales and stayed in this old building. I was at dinner with these guys I was hanging out with who I didn't really like but figured it was better than sitting alone and then this girl came over and sat with us.We didn't say much at first but instead joined in the group conversation. But eventually we got talking to each other and I can't remember the last time I've just hit it off with a person so quickly. Before I knew it the other guys had left and it was just us at the dinner table.After dinner we just explored the huge house we were staying in and went outside and looked at the stars and just talked and talked and she makes me so happy it's insane. Bearing in mind this was on the first day, so from then on we basically spent the whole weekend together just doing random shit and having the best time. I kept thinking she'd get sick of me or I'd get sick of her but we just kept finding things to do and talk about.We got back yesterday and chilled at hers for ages, and we're meeting up tomorrow to go to a bar. This isn't even like a romantic thing I don't think at least not right now, I'm just so happy to have someone like that. I thought I was losing myself when I moved to Uni because there was no one I felt comfortable with but it kinda feels like she's saved me ya know. Update: We just kissed I guess it was romantic.",0

"This past year has been the lowest and surprisingly highest points of my life and its not even over yet.  This time last year I was burned out from working at a hospital and spending my time off with my girlfriend whom I was also getting burned out from (4 years, 4 different times cheating, forgave her 3 times) I ditched the job and the girl and fulfilled a childhood dream.  I opened my own comic store which has been doing well overall.  Stressful but doing well.  I've also found someone new.  She's now my fiance and we live together with 2 awesome cats, getting married next October!  Its so amazing to me that I was able to do this.  Up until recently I had very little self worth.  A failed marriage that was like prison followed immediately by a toxic relationship took 9 years of my life.  Didn't think I was worth the dirt I walked on.  Even owning the comic shop didn't really make me feel any better.  I mean I was doing what I had always wanted to do but I still felt low.  Then I met her.  She's beautiful, and smart, and funny, and while our relationship has been going very fast I wouldn't have it any other way. People always tell us we're so perfect and blah blah blah (humble brag) but the truth is we have had some pretty serious moments that could have torn our relationship apart.  But we are open about everything.  We say how we are feeling and boom. 15 minutes later the arguments are over.  We empathize with each other and are able to take ourselves out of the situation and look at it from a different point of view. I didn't know that something like this existed.  A relationship thats just been so easy and easy going.  For all of you in relationships now I hope that yours is the same way.  And thank you for reading this.  Just want to tell the world that after almost a decade I am finally truly happy.",0

"this is one of the biggest and most important things to me right now.so, basically, when i was a little girl and younger than i am now, i used to be REALLY shy. i had a hard time communicating and talking to the other kids and people who weren't part of my biological family. so i was pretty awkward and i stuttered a lot, i loved to talk about things i liked though! sadly not many people wanted to talk to me since everything i tried to say ended up being weird or anxious soundingthis was a big problem for me, and because of the lack of friends i had in my past and when i was younger (not including my cousins nor my family), i didn't get involved in anything and i was extremely anti-socialnow it's not a problem for me!!while i was still really shy, i started talking to people online; my ooooold, old 2015 friends from transformice! they helped a lot, and they helped me get more comfortable around people. it sort of made me a little bit mean but it still really helped, beside the part of me that was still struggling with it.present me is VERY talkative! i just love talking to people, and i'm up for being friends with anyone that wants to, anytime. :) my favorite thing to do is just ramble on and on about things on my mind, and i don't even mind if my friend isn't listening. i do this a lot with one of my friends and it's funny! i don't mind if she doesn't listen because she doesn't have to; most of the things i say when i start to ramble aren't that important.so, this is the first club i'll ever be joining.it's great because;1. i rarely ever have anything to do after school and i have too much free time that ends up being wasted and turns out to be very boring,2. my friends are also in dance club! not all of my friends, but about half, more or less, of the people i talk to in classes on a daily schedule including my friend group of 7 (including me)3. it'll really help me with things to do after school, because i usually just waste the day away on my computer. it's not bad; i love being on here! it's very fun. but all day? that's becoming a waste. i want to do something funner with friends and get involved.so, it's VERY important to me! and even better, not just because my friends are in it, but because the director is my science teacher i had last year! she's very nice and fairly young i guess?? i'm gonna show her my favorite musicians (oh wonder, vance joy, jon bellion, passion pit, etc.) and see if she's heard of them beforeso. first dance practice. monday. tomorrow. going to be amazing!",0

"Today I watched my roommate and best friend of nearly 14 years get married to an amazing girl. She was beautiful, he was handsome. The ceremony was beautiful, the reception was lovely, and my best man's toast was very well received. I got to laugh and dance and be with friends, some of which I haven't seen in a while. The whole event was really touching, and it brought me joy to see him and his wife so happy together. I have been dealing with a handful of issues regarding depression and just needed to file for a temporary leave of absence at my college in order to deal with this issues. I don't share this in an effort to be depressing, but just to outline how important tonight felt for me. This night of love, support, and laughter really couldn't have come at a better time and for the first time in a while, I am really happy. ",0
"My girlfriend I were living in Santa Cruz at the time this was filmed and were both working all the time and incredible stressed out.  We got so busy that we forgot about the fact that we lived by the beach.. One day I told her enough was enough and we decided to play hookie and just take a day to be grateful for the blessing we have been given.  Went to the beach with our pup and some friends, cracked open a beer, and felt the happiest we had felt in weeks.  It does so much to be thankful for what you have!

"I've been in college for 5 years and I've never gotten 100% on an exam before. Granted, it was an exam on equine diseases and I've been a giant horse nerd since like first grade, but I still was surprised! None of my friends are awake yet and my family is two hours behind me, so I have no one to tell right now so I'm bragging here. ",0

"Today is her birthday and the third we are celebrating as a couple.  The first one as a couple was 2 years ago and I gave her a necklace that I carefully chose and it was so important as I knew that I was bat shit crazy in love but was not ready to give her a ring but I knew I wanted her forever but didn't have idea of what it would look like.  Lot's has happened since and now we are married and it is milestones like this that make me remember all the important times we have shared so far.   Even the daily little things, to me mean the world.  She means the world to me.   ",0

"Tl;dr at the end.On October 12th, 2001 my mother lost her battle to cancer after being diagnosed on October 12th 1999. I was 17. It destroyed me. She raised my by herself and was my only family (I'm an orphan now, with no living blood relatives, they all died when I was kid). Then, today at 7 pm, I read this article: http://birthmoviesdeath.com/2017/10/12/trent-reznors-releasing-a-cover-of-john-carpenters-halloween-theme-tomorrow/amp And for the first time on this day I'm crying because I'm happy. See my mother introduced me to John Carpenter films when I was a kid, her having a crush on Kurt Russel and Jeff Bridges helped (she loved Starman and Escape From NY). Watching Escape From NY was mind blowing and made me a John Carpenter fan for life. She even took me to see John Carpenter's Village of the Damned in theaters (I was like 10 and hid behind the seats for most of it).Then I discovered Halloween. Hands down my favorite film of all time. My favorite theme. My favorite everything. It, in it's own way, helped me cope with my mother's cancer (as an adult I realized it was because Myers became cancer and Laurie was my mother). My mother and I always watched movies together, it was all we could do because we were so poor. She loved John Carpenter's films and so do I. I had the pleasure of meeting him once and he was kind and amazing. I bought a meet and greet ticket for one of his tour stops in 2016. He went out his way for me, a fan, because I could only afford one ticket so my wife couldn't be there, who I've turned into a Carpenter fan (They Live is her favorite, we're seeing it in theaters on Halloween this year!). John Carpenter had a security guard find me so he could talk with me again in which he bought my wife a ticket for the show. Which allowed me to write the best text I've ever sent to anybody ever: John Carpenter just bought you a ticket. So a couple of nights ago, drunk and sad not looking forward to today (I also lost my 17 year old cat 6 months ago, who knew my mother and was my sweet baby girl) I went on Amazon and bought every single John Carpenter film I didn't own yet (except Cigarette Burns because I forgot about it). It made me feel better. They started arriving today, and will be arriving randomly for the rest of the month. Trent Reznor, and NIN is my favorite musician. His music, especially The Fragile: Left, has always been a solace in moments of darkness for me. It's a cathartic experience for me to listen to that disc and his music is always inspiring me to keep fighting my depression while sparking the creative part of my brain. I tend to write just listening to Reznor's music (often Ghosts 1-4). He's even covered two of my favorite pieces of music (Greig's In the Hall of the Mountain King and Led Zeppelins Immigrant Song). A friend brought me to see him live for my 31st birthday and It was the greatest concert ever. Today was hard for me. It was the first anniversary of her death without my cat, next year I will have spent half my life with a mother and without, and I've been sad all day, letting that day 16 years ago play on repeat in my head. Just after 7 pm, on the day my mom died, was when a friend's father put his hand on my shoulder, looked me in the eye and started to speak. I fell to the floor before he finished. As that was replaying through my head I saw that news article and just started crying tears of joy. Of all the days for that to be announced. It broke me out of the sad and depressed funk I've been in (and that I always get this time of year). Thank you serendipity. This smile is for you. :Dtl;dr: 16 years ago today my mother died. We shared and loved John Carpenter films, Halloween being my favorite. Trent Reznor's music helps me fight my depression, and has since she died. At 7 pm today, when 16 years ago I found out my mother died, I see an article posted today that Trent Reznor is releasing a cover of John Carpenter's Halloween theme tomorrow. It caused a cathartic flow of happy tears on what's usually the saddest day of the year for me. ",0
"I had surgery a week ago and I havent felt this amazing in 18 months. I am able to walk my dog, go to the store, and even cook a little bit! It just feels so good to say that Im getting better, so why not share my happiness with the fine people of Reddit?",0
"Not trying to brag I just really want to share. I am a Junior in college and have been stressed out applying to internships, just got a call back saying that I got one. I'm gonna be taking an entire year off of school to go work at a really big company, I'm really excited! Best news I've gotten in a long time :)",0
"Earlier this year I was going through a divorce, I didn't have a job, no idea where I would go, I don't really have much family of my own so I felt very alone in this world. I cried...a lot. I couldn't imagine a future for myself. It was so bad that I nearly ended up taking my own life.But things have turned around. I realize the ex is an emotionally abusive jerk. I am finally working again after years of being unemployed. I found out I do have loving support from friends who are closer than family. Tomorrow, I can start moving into my own place. And....I'm even going out with a wonderful guy :) All smiles. ",0
"Beyond happy. An opportunity arose in the company for a higher position with better pay and hours than what I currently have. I went for it even though I'm relatively new, and another co-worker did too who has more experience. Apparently they were blown away by my interview and I was just told I got the job! So damn happy! Had to share it here :)",0
"My wife is pregnant! After two years trying to conceive, both of us having treatment for fertility issues, and month after month of negative tests. We finally got 2 lines last night, and then another test with 2 lines this morning! We arent telling anyone yet, so I had to post it somewhere. Thank you for reading!",0
"And I couldn't be happier. My co-workers are amazing, my boss is chill, I can wear whatever I want to work, I have benefits, sick time, holiday. This is my first job after college and I'm so happy they hired me. I can't wait to see how I grow with this company ",0
"Four years ago I was depressed and fat.

After almost four years of work at University I have finally gotten a job offer at a job I think I'll love. I cannot believe I got an offer for employment. I never thought I would get one!,0
"Just wanted to share with someone!I have applied for a couple of promotions and am undergoing the testing/application process for one of them over the next month. I could potentially be successful in both of these applications, would be able to do them both concurrently, and would literally achieve my career dreams, all in the next few months. In the meantime, I was also targeted for a secondment into the position ABOVE one of the roles I applied for - which Im really excited about and will make me more competitive for both of the roles I applied for. On the personal front, my partner asked me to formalise our relationship last night. A wedding isnt really an option for us in the foreseeable future, so this is the next best thing! This will give us all the same rights as a married couple, and is a big personal commitment. Just happy and wanted to put it all out there. Thanks if you read it!",0
"Today is my 26th birthday and it couldn't have gotten off to a better start. My fiance who I am marrying in 50 days (:O excitement!) wished me a happy birthday last night when he came to bed after midnight. I woke up to a birthday gif from my best friend, who, though she is super busy with a newborn, still remembered and made sure I felt loved. A minute after my alarm went off my grandpa called me to make sure he was able to talk to me before he was out of a cell service area on his trip. My mom is making a special and fantastic birthday dinner for us (my stepdad and I share today for our birthday) tonight and I will be getting birthday cookies at work. Our kindhearted owner already wished me ""happy birthday eve"" yestersay because he wasn't sure he'd be in to see me today. The older I get, the more I appreciate small things like so many wonderful people taking the time and going out of their way to make me feel special. This has been the happiest year of my life so far and I'm filled with joy thinking of the good times ahead! What a way to start my day.",0
"I was in a 5 year relationship that was causing some pretty rough depression. She ended up breaking up with me which was hard, but it made me realize that I needed to work on myself. I have since got some help and I'm feeling emotions I completely forgot I could feel! I'm just happy to feel like a human being again. I have a crush for the first time in years and it's making me feel like a high schooler again, which is a welcomed feeling. I've started trying new hobbies and life just feels so much easier. I just wanted to share because this is one of my favorite subs.I was always the type of guy to be afraid to talk about depression, but after I admitted it was a problem things started to turn around when I put effort into it. If you're like me, don't be afraid to do something about it! Sorry if this is against any rules! not sure where the line on this kind of post is!",0
"I'm not quite to that level yet, but after a series of unhealthy relationships it's nice to know she really cares for me. :)",0
and I fucking nailed it. 2 months of studying and a month of anxious waiting and I kicked that test in the teeth. I'm so happy!,0
"We met in class last semester but for some reason I never asked her out. It's not that I was scared to, I just for some reason didn't even realize that was an option. The other day I was just like... what am I doing? I skipped right past greetings and texted her ""Hey do you wanna go on a date?""We're gonna get coffee tomorrow. Wish me luck!",0
"Just got a facebook group message inviting me to a party from a couple coworkers. I know it's not a work function, and more exclusive. This means more to me than I can actual express to any of them. I was diagnosed as bipolar, and sufficiently medicated for it, and have had a hard time maintaining relationships, both professional and personal. So the fact that they saw my name and decided to invite me means so much.I had no on else to really tell, so here I am. Thank you all for being here.",0
ive seen her around school constantly so i asked her out on a date and 3 days ago we went to get coffee and it ended with us cuddling beside a river and she told me she felt the same way and we feel in love. were both very socially awkward but when were togeter i just get a sence of pride and confidence. she is now my girlfriend and i love her very much,0
"so i posted earlier about the first date with my new girlfriend i went on but today was even more special. today was the day i sat down with her father and talked to him and he said he approved of me so i was already super happy about that. for the second date i took her out to a very fancy resturaunt where the waiter asked what the occasion is, we told him we were a new couple so he gave us are meals for free THAN i took her to my house and we spent hours on my couch cuddlind and just talking. i know it doesnt sound to special but to me having a girlfriend i can tell anything to is the most amazing thing in the world as my last gf was very abusive. anyways, ive been super happy lately and i hope all of you guys that read this are also happy too",0
"Talking to a girl that I've been on a date with and planning a second. Asked how her day was, which she replied not good so I asked if I could help. She replied with ""No just by talking to you makes my day "". This is the first time I've ever been on the receiving end of a compliment like this and it completely reassured me that she likes me too. I had to walk away from my desk because I was so giddy I couldn't focus on work.",0
I have worked really hard and a lot of hours!!! I like what I do and am good at it. I have people who work really hard for me...this means I finally have a way to promote them too!!! ,0
"We found out on January we were pregnant with our first. Our pregnancy ended in miscarriage in April. We werent trying, but we found out in June I was pregnant again! This has been a super emotional and exhausting journey for me. 4th of July I had heavy bleeding. I went to the ER and based on blood and my HCG I was miscarrying yet again. I saw my OB and he confirmed and ran blood work. He sent me to get an US the next day, so I could find out if I needed another D&C or if I could miscarry on my own. Well, the ultrasound showed a perfectly developed baby and a strong heartbeat of 150!! My HCG came back perfect as well. Ive been terrified ever since that this pregnancy will end in miscarriage. Tuesday I felt our little girl kick for the first time (my placenta blocks her), Wednesday my niece was born, and last night my husband was able to feel a tiny little kick! So thankful and happy I can feel her moving now! My mind is at such peace!",0
"I recently got to be the minister for my sister's wedding to one of my best friends.  I went and got ordained just for this, and I only had a little goof during the ceremony.  I'm so happy for them and I'm pulling for them so hard when so many of both families are against them.  They are meant to be!",0
"Over the last couple months I lost my job of 2 years and my girlfriend of 3 years. I fell into a depression slump for a month. A few days ago I started talking to a girl I met on Plenty of Fish, she's super cute and I asked her on a date and she said yes.I know there are tons of other stories about getting a date on this sub but I just needed somewhere to post this :) ",0
So I've been talking to this girl for a while and shes amazing. I've had a crush on her since about last week and we've hung out a few times but i was always scared to tell her how i feel because i didn't want to ruin our relationship. But today she came over and we hung out and she asked me what we were. So it kind of gave me a hint hat she reciprocated feelings and I felt amazing. Then she was texting me not too long ago and she said she liked me but didn't want to put a label on it too soon. I'm so happy right now. We're hanging out again soon ,0
"Just about everything that could have gone wrong went wrong in getting my Master's degree.

I'm due with my first in a week and a half and it just seems  like a good sign that it's raining, I don't know why... I also hate summer with a passion so if it's raining it means it's going to cool off. I'm so happy! ",0

"My girlfriend is really massive on art. She loves drawings, paintings, sketches, tattoos (though she doesn't have any), digital photos, canvases etc. etc.It really shows. She does a lot of art herself and I personally find it amazing, she is so talented and I always tell her, but she comes out with phrases like 'yeah, could be better though' or 'but have you seen x's art?'.I've always told her she should open an instagram account and just post what she does, if not for the likes and attention then just to have it as a mini portfolio -- but alas she's pretty socially withdrawn, and usually likes to keep to herself.Finally today, I brought it up in conversation and she said she thought she'd be ready to give it a go, I was so excited. I instantly got to helping her set it all up, and she posted two pieces of her artwork. 0 followers, but an instant response! She got 5 likes on each within about 2 minutes!We were both really happy, and she started posting more of her work. Over two hours, she had posted 11 pieces up and each one was over 10 likes, and some even hitting 20! She gained about 10 followers and about 1-2 comments on most of them complimenting her work, and she seemed to be really ecstatic about it, and plans on posting more as she does it all.  It made me really warm inside so see her come out of her shell a bit and share her passion with people who enjoyed what she does, and it was all I could think about tonight, my 12 hour work shift just flew by and I've been smiling all night.I'm just really excited she has a small community she can share her work with and give her motivation and drive to do more, and I'm also excited to see more art come from her, as her talent just makes me melt.Thanks for reading, just felt like it'd be a good /r/happy share :) ",0

I've always fantasized about a AMP experience as well... but I have no clue what to expect. Will there be any weirdness? I'm pretty awkward as it is and I feel like they won't be used to seeing a fairly attractive, fit dude in his early 20s, come in to there place. Will I have to be extra assertive with what I want, since I don't necessarily ""look the part"" (I'm stereotyping all you guys as big, older, beefy truck drivers, sorry ). How do I know when to ask for FS or whatever, where do I leave the money? When?? If I'm naked how do I give her the money before she starts?? Lol I really just need a walk through. Lastly, I have a rare skin rash that oh so conveniently flared up. It's called gutate psoriasis, and looks pretty nasty and weird (Google it). It's not as bad as most the Google images you'll see, but it's still pretty unsightly and covers most of my torso, stomach and arms. I'm really afraid they will see it and it will just turn them off from it completely, would I be better off waiting till it clears up? I'd rather not as it.could take.months... think I'd be fine if I explained it or would they kick my gross ass out? Any help guys please!",0

"Note: They asked us to use the hashtag #BringBackHappyEndings, so go do that!PopFest was a lot of fun and the crowd was really into it. The plot of the new episode was totally stupid but the point was really about calling back to as many jokes and catch phrases as possible. Episode 401 was titled ""Happy to Be Here.""Basically the premise is that after the series finale, Brad and Jane had a big fight about her moving to Tokyo to take a job at Toyota (although Alex thinks she works at Toy Yoda, a company that exclusively makes little green Jedis from Star Wars). Their fight breaks up the entire group (unlike the Alex and Dave break up at the start of the series. Get it? the opposite thing happened) so no one has spoken for the last 939 days.In the last 3 years, Penny got married and divorced three times to guys she met on Kid Rock cruises. Max moved to DC. Alex turned Xela into a Fortune 500 company and moved to London. Jane runs Toyota's sex doll department in Tokyo. Dave made a food truck with Paul Haggis called Haggis' Haggis but Paul screwed him so now Dave is recreating the road trip from Chef. Brad went off the grid and lives in the woods getting raped by bears. They really went off the rails with the Brad storyline.So the plot of the episode is that Max and Penny want to reunite the gang to go to Scotty's funeral (Scotty's dead). Eventually everyone returns to Chicago, Brad and Jane reunite, and Alex reveals she got Scotty to pretend to be dead to get them all together. But twist! Scotty actually did die! Penny has to go sing Torn at his funeral, because his head was torn off while riding a Sea-Doo. To which Dave replies: Sea-Doo? More like Sea-Don't!Then Dave awakes suddenly, and Alex says ""Bitch it is 5:30!"" He tells her all about this crazy dream he had that she left him at the altar and she tells him to go back to bed, everything's okay. But wait, she asks, is that a thing people can do if they're having second thoughts?The end.",0

Brad says that it wasn't really a picture of him but rather, a picture of one of the guys on In Living Color, a show that the actor, Damon Wayans, Jr.'s father was in. Before I get down voted to China (I'm in the US), I'm well aware that DW is DWJs dad in the show and in real life, but this was a nod ""Brad"" made to his father in real life as an actor. I thought it was pretty clever, having not caught it in several re-watches.",0

"I'm having trouble getting my Season 1 of Happy Endings in the correct order or storyline. I feel like my original order was incorrect so I have gone to [thetvdb.com] (http://thetvdb.com/?tab=season&seriesid=167571&seasonid=329101&lid=7) which says it is in order of air date, but I feel like that is wrong and I will say why.[thetvdb Season 1 order:] (http://thetvdb.com/?tab=season&seriesid=167571&seasonid=329101&lid=7)1 Pilot	2011-04-13	2 The Quicksand Girlfriend	2011-04-13	3 Your Couples Friends & Neighbors	2011-04-20	4 Mein Coming Out	2011-04-20	5 Like Father, Like Gun	2011-04-27	6 Of Mice & Jazz-Kwon-Do	2011-05-04	7 Dave of the Dead	2011-05-04	8 The Girl With the David Tattoo	2011-05-11	9 You've Got Male	2011-05-11	10 Bo Fight	2011-05-18	11 Barefoot Pedaler	2011-05-18	12 The Shershow Redemption	2011-05-25	13 Why Can't You Read Me?     2011-08-24    One thing I find incorrect here is that in ""Dave of the Dead"", Dave decides to get a food truck, but in ""Your Couples Friends & Neighbors"", Dave and Max view the teddy bear nanny cam footage on his food truck, 4 episodes before he actually decides to get the truck. Also, in ""Barefoot Pedaler"" Dave and Alex aren't getting along similar to early in the season, So this episode should be earlier, as in my original order:My original order:1 Pilot	2011-04-13    2 Bo Fight	2011-05-18    3 Barefoot Pedaler	2011-05-18    4 Dave of the Dead	2011-05-04    5 The Quicksand Girlfriend	2011-04-13    6 Of Mice & Jazz Kwon Do	2011-05-04    7 Mein Coming Out	2011-04-20    8 Your Couples Friends & Neighbors	2011-04-20    9 You've Got Male	2011-05-11    10 The Girl With The David Tattoo	2011-05-11    11 Like Father, Like Gun	2011-04-27    12 The Shershow Redemption	2011-05-25    13 Why Can't You Read Me?     2011-08-24    Now this makes sense in that the food truck storyline is more in order. But, to me, it seems incorrect that ""The Quicksand Girlfriend"" is no longer in the 2nd slot. In that episode, Dave is rebounding, Alex is looking for a new roomate (both make sense after a failed wedding) and Derrick is introduced (which makes sense for a new character introduction to happen in S01E02 in a new series).What episode Does Dave move in with Max? Alex wouldn't look for a new roomate until Dave moves out. Did the episodes originally air out of order? Why am I so confused by this season and why am I having so much trouble getting them in the right order?!?!?also, [Wikipedia] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Happy_Endings_episodes#Season_1_.282011.29) has the same order as [thetvdb] (http://thetvdb.com/?tab=season&seriesid=167571&seasonid=329101&lid=7)Anybody have the DVD's/Blu-Rays with the actual correct order of episodes? Are the DVD's/Blu-Rays even correct? Any help would be appreciated!!Sorry to nerd out on this show but its my annual revisit Happy Endings time and I've started noticing all this.",0
Does anyone know the song playing at the end of season 1 episode 7 (Dave of the dead)? It plays when Dave's truck is being chased by the hipster zombies.,0
"Original broadcast episode 7 (shoot order episode 3) Brad, Jane, Max and Dave in Max's apartment taking about a zombie apocalypse (happens during the cold-open, right after Jane says ""lack of ambition, no self-respect"") what does Brad say? In roughly a dozen viewings of this episode, I've never been able to figure it out. If someone owns the DVD and can turn subtitles on to find out for me I would really appreciate it. Thanks in advance.  ",0
"So, I watched the whole series a cuple years ago and thought it was fantastic. And I remmebered an episode where at some point, I think towards the end Alex and Dave work some issue of theirs by sliding down a muddy slide. I can't remember which episode it is. If anybody can remember, pls point it out for me",0
"happywrites thinks her therapist is a genie, does that mean her wish of bringing Happy Endings back is coming true?",0
I had never heard of this show but discovered it on Hulu a few weeks back. It is (was) fantastic. Anyone watching it now? I am halfway through season 2. ,0
"In one episode Alex mentions something about her trivia team. She said the name and I thought it was super clever, but I can't find it anywhere and don't remember which episode it was in. It was literally only focused on for a sentence basically. ",0
"Seriously no one asked about the song from S01E01?  Well I'm gonna ask - which song do we hear at the club with lyrics ""make that booty bounce..."".  I can't believe tunefind lists only 2 songs and not even a question about this song in particular.",0
"I've noticed so many more nods, references and what seem to be inside jokes with other shows that only they are in on. Can this show get any better? ",0
Which is too bad because I was going to suggest it to some friends but now I don't know how they will watch it.,0
"I've had it in my Amazon cart since before it was released, monitored Best Buy and other places for the price, and it's always been substantially more expensive than the other seasons.As of today: Season 1 - $7.99 Season 2 - $7.64 Season 3 - $23.49This is the cheapest it's ever been, usually hovering closer to the $35 mark (and has been as expensive as $45.99)Does anyone know if they didn't produce as many, or if a different company released it, or... what? What could it possibly be that caused this season to consistently be so much more expensive than the other seasons? Any ideas?",0
"Loved HE and just finished my second watching of the series. The only thing that I thought was cringy was they intentionally drew attention to and over hyped Max's ""I'm gay but I'm not a gay stereotype like Derek"" persona. Max's character was the best but just the fact that they did that by trying to make him as anti stereotypical as possible and even by making other characters look metrosexual really ruined it.",0

"AAAARRRRRRGHHHH! God damn it. This show should have been as big as How I Met Your Mother, Friends or Scrubs- it's just as good if not a hell of a lot better! Can you imagine if we had 6-7 more seasons of this! Oh life is so bloody unfair sometimes! ",0
"I skimmed youtube and couldn't find it. Would love a clip of the boys dancing their hearts out, Kid N Play style.",0
Corey the bully says something about Rocksteady and then Penny mentions Bebop immediately after in the next scene. It's around 8 minutes or so in. Am I reading too much into this?,0
"Ok to start off, I will say that I LOVE this show, even more than Friends and I was devastated when it was cancelled. Anyway, I've been watching through again and noticed that there have been a number of points where the story seems to jump around a lot.I'm currently watching S03E10 Kickball 2: The Kickening and Penny talks a lot about how she's looking to hook up with guys there. But in the previous episode she's already dating Pete and they're pretty serious (2 episodes later they get engaged!).Thinking back to season one as well, in the 10th episode, Dave moves his stuff into Max's but I'm pretty sure he's been living there for the previous 9 episodes right?? Am I just over analysing things or is there actually a bit of confusion with the continuity of things??",0
"I'm making a phone wallpaper with important things or recurring jokes in the show. So far I have the racist parrot, steak me home tonight logo and the unbreakable piata. Anything else that comes to mind?",0
"Anyone watch these newest shows from the Happy Endings alumnis? One Big Happy is unfathomably terrible and even Elisha Cuthbert no matter how cute she is, isn't enough to make me wanna watch another second of that trash.I was actually pleasantly surprised that Knighton's new show ""Weird Loners"" wasn't that bad, it's ratings were super low on the debut this week, so it probably won't last long, but I'll stick with it during it's short run.",0
"As a long-time fan of Happy Endings, I have to say, I am disappointed. Not at the original countdown tweet, which as we all (correctly) guessed at the time was done as a joke.I am disappointed with everything that followed. The stringing along. The obvious hints. The thinly veiled promises that there would be ""something"" at the end of the rainbow. Whether it be some reunion, maybe a one-off episode, perhaps even a webisode. Or, yes, a fourth season. But here we are, almost two months later, tail between our legs. Which begs the question: how can you waste so much goodwill in a matter of seconds?At any point you could have clarified the situation. You could have officially stated: ""this is definitely a meaningless prank, but we're trying to turn this into an actual campaign"". We would have all jumped on board in a second. You could have also shot a ""five-minute cold open"", or at least announced you were on the way to doing so. Before April 1st.After all, this is the time of miracles and sudden revivals. The age of Netflix's Arrested Development, Yahoo's Community, Kickstarter's Veronica Mars, Indiegogo's Super Troopers 2. Right?But no. This cat-and-mouse game was all for naught. Hardy har har. We actually ARE fans of some show that got cancelled a couple years ago. You got us real good! What a fucking waste.",0

Do they ever address how Alex pays her bills? Her store doesn't exactly seem successful...,0
"Two weeks ago, there I was re-watching ""The Girl Next Door"" with Elisha Cuthbert (back in 2002 she even made Mila Kunis look like a average girl...)And I remembered that she was in ""24"" (Cougar...Elisha...cougar...Elisha), but I was like ""let's check out what other things as she done"" and there it was ""Happy Endings""At first I was like ""meh...ok, another FRIENDS/HIMYM show..."", but I gave it a try, and I've to confess now I'm like:""This show is Ah-mah-zing""And Elisha is still ""super cyuth"" (probably only second to bear-Max)Ps: Hope that the tweet from the ""Happy Writers"" means a new season, but if it isn't, I wish it was at least a 1st April prank made by Alex and that they tweet her face in a fax-like picture.",0
"I keep understanding more references, especially this new one I just understood in season 3 episode 2. When Penny looks in the backseat of her car to find Jane has appeared, she yells CCH Pounder?! which is a reference to the actress who played Mrs. Frederic in my second favourite show, Warehouse 13, always popping up at unexpected times. I fucking love Happy Endings so much for this.",0
"I didnt listen to it yet but this site has a recap with a quote from her: http://www.thefancarpet.com/NewsPage.aspx?n_id=10915Casey told Alison I think it might be our writers assistant joking around, and unfortunately I dont think its a welcome joke for everyone (0:25:53). I dont love that [someone] did that, to be honest. To my knowledge theres nothing moving forward, I apologize if it got anyone excited. (0:26:46)Well thats a bummer. Damn, so the jerkface writers assistant that runs the twitter really was just fucking around all this time?",0
"Some of you may recall I posted a version of this script about one year ago. With this whole ""a new day"" thing popping up by the Happy Endings writers Twitter, I decided it might be time to revisit it.I trimmed out the fat, got rid of some bad jokes, and added some new jokes that I expect I won't know are bad until next year.[Here's](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bz5SU9l8k1BKTGxUdGotMjdEdXc/view) the link.While last time I asked for opinions on plot, this time I'm hoping for opinions on jokes.

"So I was thinking the other day, articles keep mentioning Amazon, Yahoo, Netflix or ABC to be bringing the show back.What about VH1 or Logo TV which both have aired or are airing the show. (I'm not in the U.S. so I don't know if those networks still air it or not.)",0

Any thoughts on their recent [Twitter posts](https://twitter.com/happywrites)?,0
"The title is honestly why I didn't start watching it til the end of season 2, it seemed kinda meh. Once I actually started watching the show, I was hooked. But the title turned me off, it seemed schmaltzy on the one hand and a cheap attempt at a double entendre on the other. It also doesn't really have anything to do with the plot of the show. I don't feel like happy (or ironically unhappy) endings are a big part of the showAnd the opening titles/music don't really get me jazzed for the show, I feel like they're an annoying jingle in between the (usually amazing) cold open, and the rest of the episode. I feel like the show would do better if it had a catchy intro like Friends, Scrubs, Psych or Community, or even Parks and Rec, which has a fun intro even though it is wordless. EDIT: I shared my opinions on the opening, but my question was whether people think the show might do better with new viewers if the title, opening, or both were changed.I think it's a relevant question now that it might be brought back, and because it never got the acclaim or recognition it should have. (Not ratings, lots of shows get ""low"" ratings but are well-known, like Parks and Rec)",0
"I've been thinking about these tweets and I'm just as in the dark as everyone else.  One thought that crossed my mind was, what if they announced a Kickstarter to fund season 4?  Would you donate?  If so, how much?  I'm just curious how badly we all want the show back.",0
"Allow me to present a theory on how they could relaunch Happy Endings given where they left the series and what all of the actors are currently up to.----Season 4, Episode 1: Alex and Dave finally got married!  The episode opens with the gang all together at the airport seeing the newlyweds off.  For their honeymoon Dave has insisted that he and Alex go explore his Cherokee roots for an undetermined amount of time.  (This allows Zachary and Elisha to pursue their current projects but keeps the door open for their return at any point.)  The six friends talk about what's been going on the past two years, and we are treated to some flashbacks of the wedding (Max made out with the priest!  During the ceremony!) and other adventures (Dave was run over by his own food truck giving him a big insurance payoff).  The scene ends with Dave and Alex boarding the plane in slow motion while sentimental music plays and the camera cuts back and forth to the characters looking at each other with bittersweet emotions except for Max who is stuffing his face with a giant ""Barry Bond's CinnaBon-Bon"" that was introduced in an earlier joke.  After A&D board, Brad remarks that they should probably go since the TSA will be here any minute.  A cop is seen headed their way riding one of those airport golf carts.  The four remaining characters start to run away while Jane yells that she told them they should have just said goodbye outside instead of sneaking through security.  Out of breath even though he's only run a few steps, Max replies with something about sticking it to ""The Man.""  The scene ends with the comically slow security cart rolling by in hot pursuit.In the next scene, Brad, Jane, Max, and Penny are at Rosalita's talking about how they narrowly escaped arrest.  Penny tells everyone that now that Dave and Alex are gone she can finally introduce them to her new boyfriend.  ""Oh here he is now.  Guys, meet Rick!""  Rick waves.  Brad: ""Rick Rickman?  Dave's old psychiatrist?""  (Who was played by Ken Marino, currently starring in ""Merry Me"" with Casey Wilson).  Rick explains that Dave was never technically his patient because he only ever paid Rick with vintage Bulls trading cards.  Penny explains that she always liked Rick, but she didn't want to hurt Dave's feelings.  Now that Dave's gone she and Rick can start dating again.  Max says he's not crazy about betraying Dave's trust, but Rick is at least better than the last guy she was with.  Cut to Penny making out with the same priest!  During someone else's wedding ceremony!----So there you have it.  We lose Alex and Dave (hopefully just temporarily), but we get Jake from ""Marry Me"" who has shown he fits well in the Happy Endings style and he has great chemistry with Penny/Annie.  If five characters isn't enough we can bring over some of the other Marry Me characters.  Max and Gill can have a ""who's the lazier slob"" contest.  Rick can bring in Denna as an ex-girlfriend; Penny is surprisingly not threatened at all, but Jane hates her because she wants to be the only tall skinny blonde in the group.  Kay can show up and put Brad and Max to shame by being a better black friend AND a better gay friend.  The sky's the limit.This all hinges on ""Marry Me"" getting canceled, which I hope hope hope doesn't happen, but if that's what it takes to get Happy Endings back, I'm on board.Edit: formatting ",0
"With Damon Wayans Jr. leaving New Girl, Adam Pally leaving The Mindy Project, and Eliza Coupe's show Benched being canceled, we are now left with Casey Wilson's struggling show Marry Me, the yet-to-premiere but likely ill-fated One Big Happy with Elisha Cuthbert, and what may be the only survivor this year if it manages the ratings: Weird Loners with Zachary Knighton.Here's my idea for a new show, since Happy Endings seems unlikely to come back: Six struggling actors try to revitalize their careers while maintaining the friendships they formed working on a beloved cancelled comedy.There we go, make it happen Netflix!",0
Did anyone catch the Dogs in Heat stand? I saw it and sadly realized that Dave was never able to beat their meat. :(,0
"I really enjoying this weeks Marry Me Episode. Really funny. And there was a line about Happy Endings. During the lie detector scene, Casey Wilson's character talks about voting for the black guy on Happy Endings on BuzzFeed.",0

"Annie (Casey Wilson's character) says ""And yes...

"I want to get my roommates into Happy Endings since I think they'd both like it.  I also told them if they could honestly tell me they didn't like it I'd give them each $5.  They both like Friends and It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia and HE is sort of cross between their two brands of humor.  But I want to show them an episode or two that would really sum up what the show is about.  Ones that have some good laughs, but not the funniest episodes, but don't deal too much with any long term plotlines (IE nothing to do with Dave and Alex).  Any ideas?",0
I am watching both shows. They come on the same night! I REALLY like Benched. I like the supporting cast. I real free for her character and what she is going thru and i find the writing very funny.Marry Me started out really hilarious to me but the last couple of episodes werent that funny to me. I think the supporting cast is great. I like Casey and her male lead. How does anybody else feel?,0
"For some reason I absolutely loved it when Max proposed going to the airport to get hammered and read some Grisham novels.  What episode was that from?  I feel like that line and the line where he says he was dating a Basque, but broke up because ""for a separatist he was pretty clingy"" are two criminally underrated lines.",0
"I will like the show. IT feature a guy I loved in another underrated short lived comedy, Better Of Ted, Jay Harrington. Eliza is good of course but it feels like she's playing Jane in another setting. I keep hoping Brad (Damon Wayans) will show up! LOL",0
They did such a good job showcasing each of the leads. They all got their own stories. Each had backgrounds. The various combos worked. Do we feel that some of the leads stood out more strongly than others? Were any of them underrated? I think about Alex. I LOVED her as the series went on. She had the tricky task of making us like her because from the beginning she leaves Dave at the altar. And she wasnt the stereotypical dumb blonde. She was actually smarter. What are your thoughts?,0
"I know a lot of us Happy Endings fans are bummed but Marry Me is actually pretty decent.  Its about a couple that has been together for a while and decided to get married (sound sort of familiar) Good cast, has the same flow and jokes as Happy Endings.  I miss Brad (whos awesome on New Girl) but the show really is enjoyable. Its filled the gap this has left. Give it a shot Penny shines through just as she did before. ...also its got Sarah Wright who is just stunning (Parks and Rec) and Ken Marino from Party Down. (I know other shows they are in but those are the most prominent lately) ",0
Max was one of the best well written gay characters ever on a sitcom! And Adam Pally was sooooo good in the part! Along with great direction! AND Adam did a great Chicago accent!!! I miss Happy Endings!,0
"I'm kind of a stats obsessive and I've done line counts for various shows.

Alex had 22 lines in the same episode, which is the all-time lowest for any of the regular characters.   Brooke Kerkovich had the most lines of any one-time guest character (42).

"When someone asked if the rest of the Happy Endings cast would guest, Caspe said it's very likely and you'll probably so a lot of them pop up as the season goes on. Sadly not as their Happy Endings characters, but better than nothing. I think he said that they already had some ideas for characters Cuthbert and Coupe could play in future episodes.But a heres something I found interesting, he revealed a semi-regular character from Happy Endings will be crossing over to his new show ""Marry Me"".... Stephen Guarino will once again be PLAYING DERRICK on this show, hes in the Halloween episode and will probably keep bringing him back after that. He said it was weird and didn't really make sense that this same character is in both shows, but they liked him too much on the other show and since this show is also set in Chicago it seems like he could exist in both universes.I actually kinda remember Greg Garcia doing something similar with Raising Hope and My Name is Earl.

"So I needed something to fill the hole in my heart left by that disappointing finale to HIMYM and had already watched my way through most of the shows on U.S. Netflix so I decided to try Hola Unblocker to see what Canada had to offer. The first two shows at the top of the list were Community and Happy Endings, and since I'd already watched Community I figured I'd give Happy Endings a try. Holy shit, I've been watching it nonstop since I found it, putting me into season two. I can honestly say it is one of the most consistently hilarious shows I've ever had the pleasure of watching. That season two intro with the ""you stabbed me dude"" had me clutching my sides from laughter. How the hell could a show like this have been cancelled while ABC still manages to pump out shitty pilots for bad shows that flop in a matter of weeks?",0

"I have had a vague memory of a scene from a movie or tv show in my head for the last week or so. I posted this on /r/tipofmytongue and the first reply said it might have happened on Happy Endings.I think what happens in the scene is a character (I can't remember if it's a man or a woman) goes on a long rant about how they succeeded despite a rough upbringing and mentions they went to Bryn Mawr law school.At the end of the whole thing another character just says something like ""I didn't know Bryn Mawr had a law school.""I might be remembering some stuff wrong. The only thing I feel confident in is that Bryn Mawr was named.",0
"The greatest reson that I love this show, besides great characters, amazing casting and hilarious episodes, is the dynamics of the group. Sure Alex left Dave at the beginning, but they all managed to stay friends. The group never seems to encounter many problems within the group, except for characters' personalities clashing at times, but it's more like the group against the world. That's what I feel when I watch the show. I love shows when the characters are really great and get along all the time. Maybe it's just me?! ",0

It was completely smile inducing and it made me forget about whatever else was going in my life. Are there any other shows with a similar sense of humour that can replicate this warm, happy feeling? Ever since HE ended, I've been looking for a smart, single camera comedy to take its place. The only other shows I've gotten this from are Scrubs, New Girl and How I Met Your Mother.

But it works if you click the link.Happy Endings might be over but at least we can still enjoy and support the cast we love so much by checking out all the future stuff they do which I'm sure will be great.",0
"I posted this on another Happy Endings forum a few weeks ago (have since updated some stuff before posting it here), and I've been meaning to repost it here on reddit, and now with todays depressing news, it seems like a good time to put it up....For anyone missing the Happy Endings cast, heres all the upcoming stuff to look for them in soon that I've been able to find:Upcoming TV stuff: Zachary Knighton just appeared as Elijah Wood's mailman on the new season of Wilfred, not sure if this is a recurring role of just a one time spot. He also mentioned on twitter a while back he's in the upcoming season of ""Always Sunny in Philadelphia"", possibly playing the same character he played on there several seasons ago? I'm not sure. Would be funny if he was returning as that character to get some revenge on the gang, in the similar way Chase did on Max -- too bad we were robbed of another season, I wanted them to continue the Max/Chase thing, darnit! Adam Pally and Casey Wilson will be guest stars on the new season of ""Comedy Bang Bang"" on IFC starting in July. Casey's the main guest for the September 13 episode titled ""Casey Wilson Wears A White Lace Dress & A Black Blazer"" and Adam will be involved in some kind of skit with Chelsea Peretti and Doug Benson, they posted the pic on the Comedy Bang Bang facebook page a while back, it looked like he was playing a UPS delivery guy. Casey will also be appearing in some sketches on the Comedy Central show ""Drunk History"", premiering on July 9th. Heres a pic of her filming a sketch [as Dolly Parton](http://i.imgur.com/lUcbXCL.png). I posted this last week, but another reminder that Adam and Casey are gonna be the two panel comedians paired together for ""The Jeselnik Offensive"" episode that airs on July 23 on Comedy Central. Thats gotta be the one I'm looking most forward to, I hope we keep getting to see the cast keep doing some stuff together in the future. I definitely think Casey and Adam will keep working together in stuff anyway, since they were already good friends before Happy Endings. In a perfect world they'd end up on another show together and Damon/Eliza would end up on another show together, they were my 2 favorite pairings on the show, it's a shame to waste the perfect chemistry those 4 had. I posted about this the other day, but Casey is co-starring in Paul Scheer's new Adult Swim pilot called ""Filthy Sexy Teen$"", which is a spin-off to Scheer's other funny Adult Swim show ""NTSF:SD:SUV"", I now kinda remember that ""Filthy Sexy Teen$"" was a fake tv commercial they ran during some of the credits on ""NTSF"" last season. Much the same way ""NTSF"" originally started as a fake tv commercial during the first season of Childrens Hospital. Of course it's been rumored that Damon will go back to New Girl now, possibly for at least a couple episodes. I haven't been able find any upcoming projects for Elisha yet, but with the announcement of FOX doing a 24 reboot, I assume she's likely to make some appearances in that. I think she surprised everyone on Happy Endings with how funny she was as Alex, lets hope this isn't the last we see of her doing comedic stuff. Don't think anyone ever would've guessed Elisha Cuthbert would be so good at comedy all these years!Upcoming movies: I'm sure most here have heard about this by now, but Damon's filming a movie he's starring in with Jake Johnson (Nick from New Girl) called ""Lets Be Cops"", lets hope it turns out to be good. Adam is also currently filming his first lead role in a movie called ""Search Party"" that he stars in with TJ Miller (The Goodwin Games, played Shershow in Happy Endings season one) and Thomas Middleditch (UCB comedian) and also features Alison Brie from Community and Krysten Ritter from Dont Trust the B in Apt 23. Casey recently made a movie ""Ass Backwards"", that her and June Diane Raphael (NTSF:SD:SUV, Burning Love, Sadie the lesbian gynecologist on New Girl) wrote and star in together. It was at Sundance earlier this year and is supposed to be a female take on ""Dumb and Dumber"" type buddy comedies. It will have it's LA premiere at the [2013 Outfest](http://www.outfest.org/tixSYS/2013/xslguide/eventnote.php?EventNumber=3785&notepg=) in July and is coming out with a wider release later this year. Another Sundance movie Casey co-stars in called ""C.O.G."" (written by David Sedaris) will also be at Outfest and will have a wider release on Sept 20. Casey plays a rare dramatic role in this one. Zachary has a new movie hes in called ""Teddy Bears"" that premiered at a film festival Seattle earlier this month, its some kind of dark comedy that also stars Gillian Jacobs and David Krumholtz. I was watching a video interview with him where he mentioned he's shooting a movie in Austin Texas this summer, haven't been able to find what the movie is yet. Eliza recently co-starred as the love interest in an indie movie called ""Shanghai Calling"" that was on VOD earlier this year, I remember her talking about it in an interview and saying she had to learn Chinese for the movie. They just announced it'll be on DVD on September 17.--I'll update in the replies of this thread if I find anything new, others can feel free to add to it if they hear about any new projects or appearances. It's sad we won't see them get to keep making the show but With the talent of this cast I have no doubt that they'll all find lots of work in their post-HappyEndings careers. After how good they all were on Happy Endings, I would think they'll all be in high demand when networks are casting for new sitcoms, especially come pilot season.",0
"So in the Season 2 episode Party of Six, the gang goes to a restaurant only to get served by a girl who Dave had previously dated only to find out she was in high school.I could have sworn that this actually happened (Dave bringing the girl to dinner with the gang on Penny's b-day the year before, her wearing a douchey hat, etc.) in a Season 1 episode, but I cannot seem to find the episode.

As much as we'd like to see this show continue, all signs have been pointing to the fact that season 3 will be it for our weird little comedy.I just wanted to thank you for the great discussions/posts/memes. Even when things have gotten a little weird (aka this week), this is a pretty great group of people. Happy Endings was one of the best sitcoms while it was airing, and you all were a part of that fanbase that even started a conversation for a fourth season. While it looks like Sony was ultimately unsuccessful, the fact that this wacky midseason replacement that seemed sent to die ended up with 57 episodes is a feat itself. The odds were always stacked against Happy Endings and hey, we got three seasons out of it.I wanted to thank the other moderators. I'll stick around and keep moderating. Others are welcome to do the same. There still is plenty of cool shit to post and hey, if you ever see any of the Gang on the street, a picture would be great.

"Dear Executives of ABC, TBS, and now USA Network,As a fan of good TV, I love the witty, critically acclaimed comedy Happy Endings. So do many others, I am sure of it. Recent distressing news of the cancellation of its programming buddy, Dont Trust the B in Apt. 23 has us fans very worried that Happy Endings wont make it to a well-deserved fourth season. I understand that ratings are almost everything to keep a show running, but Happy Endings seemed to perform better with lead-in viewers during its first and second seasons immediately following the smash hit, award winning comedy Modern Family on Wednesday nights at 9:30pm airtime.Mr. Paul Lee, President of ABC Entertainment Group, said the following during a January TCA press tour, We just wanted to say to our audiences that they have more chances to see this. We love this show,"" he said, noting that he recognizes Endings has to stand on its own and that he is confident the series can.If the President of ABC Entertainment recognizes that the series is strong enough to stand on its own, why not renew it for a fourth season? Could you consider it a move to another programming block, perhaps back to Comedy Wednesdays? Any slot in that block would be very good for this comedy. The current confusing scheduling of two episodes a week is also a marker that the show is on the bubble of cancellation. Alex Kerkovich is already crying reading this letter, don't make it worse for her!If the programming space on ABC is an issue, consider the successful (if bold) moving of Cougar Town from the ABC network to TBS network, where, since its move, has performed incredibly well, boasting 2.2 million viewers for its fourth season premiere episode in January. Im sure Cougar Town fans appreciated the move, and will continue to watch faithfully.Recent news of USA Network's interest in picking up Happy Endings if ABC ultimately cancels it led me to add USA Network executives to my efforts. USA Network is responsible for awesome original programming including Psych, Burn Notice, Royal Pains, Covert Affairs, Political Animals, and Necessary Roughness. Happy Endings would fit well among these fan favorites.As fans, we enjoy the witty jokes and gags on this amazing show. The cast is top-notch and blend well together on our TV screens. The writing team is incredible, and, if evidenced by the Funny Or Die video of the writers room, are very tolerant of new ideas. Give the gang another chance, or suffer the wrath of Mark Blumno wait. Why cant I remember my own name?Critical edit on 5/14: Happy Endings has been officially cancelled by ABC after a complete mess of a season scheduling (was Hip Hop Santa on scheduling detail?) despite self-referential network hashtag #SaveHappyEndings in mid-March. Mr. Lee has lied to the ABC demographic and fans about what he wants for the show. He wanted it to die all along. For shame!! I, an avid Castle and Modern Family fan will NEVER watch another show on ABC again. I hope others will join me, for killing Happy Endings, Better off Ted, AND Pushing Daises (a critically lauded trifecta) is all too much to bear.Thank you for your time!TLDR FUCK Paul Lee for crushing my hopes. The petition letter is something execs almost never see due to how Change.org does biz. The link to petition here: http://www.change.org/petitions/save-happy-endings is a gateway to a brief memo auto-sent to ABC/Turner/USA (NBC Uni) at the bottom when a person signs the document via an online signature.

"Right now there are 2,880 friends on this subreddit. I think I can safely say every single of us is so devoted to Happy Endings that the dedicated fan base is almost like a cult. We need Happy Endings to not only be not cancelled (4th season renewal by ABC or pick-up by TBS or USA Network), we want Happy Endings to maintain the highest level of humour and to, if it's even possible, induce even more headache and nausea from laughing too much.We need to SAVE HAPPY ENDINGS. I have been confused in the past few months about the validity and effectiveness of the petitions out there. So I think those of us who have Twitter should just constantly tweet @ABC all the reasons we should save Happy Endings. I feel like the studio and the channel will get our ardent message if we inundate their Twitter. This is something I feel like I can personally do since I am always on Twitter anyways and I know this is something that others can do as well. Any time Happy Endings come across your mind, send a tweet to ABC.This is a business after all. Television shows do need to pull in big ratings to make big money. However, ABC needs to know exactly how strongly we feel about this show. I don't know about you guys but that hour during Friday evening, I really really really give a shit about the show and it has my attention through the hour. And after the original airing, I will find the episodes and then watch them over and over and over and over again until the laughter I get is only partially painful rather than full-on painful. This devotion is conducive to a network's business. ABC needs to realize that.So let us tweet at ABC, Facebook ABC, write long, passionate fan letters, or even stalk the decision-makers. Whatever you can do, do it. SAVE HAPPY ENDINGS!",0

"Last night, Change.org informed me that my little petition that could hit a staggering 400 signatures in just about 2 weeks of being ""live"" on that site. This is probably due to my rather aggressive side project of promoting it round the Internets these past few weeks. Thanks to you, and people I've hooked on the show, fans, etc. from around the web and world, we've hit this milestone. Change.org suggested I contact a local TV news station (probably ABC 8 here in CT) to do a blurb. That's not out of the question. Still promoting it, and will be mailing a few printed copies with signatures to Paul Lee (President, ABC Entertainment) and 2 addresses of Samie Kim Falvey, Executive VP of Comedy Development at ABC at the very least.

We'll probably get an ""official"" update on the show's uncertain future after the March 29th ""new time"" premiere, and maybe Mr. Lee and co will listen to the growing chorus of fans from around the globe. Not stopping me from still making a YT video, SoundCloud shenanigans, and the like. This is my side project, one I feel deeply for, and I don't want Happy Endings to end up like two recent ABC productions: Better Off Ted and Pushing Daisies, both highly acclaimed by TV critics but under-performing with viewers, hence the ""Brilliant...but cancelled!"" categorization.

"4 episodes left this season (17 total, which is 4 more than the first season and 4 less than last year's full (aired) season) and they're showing them two episodes at a time over two weeks?

It's been too long since a fresh episode (and still 3 weeks to go), I'm torn between wanting to get my eyes on the new episodes and wanting to savor them.EDIT: I got this information off Wiki (while looking to see if I accidentally missed an episode). http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Happy_Endings_episodesAccording to IMDb it does show there are 22 episodes but they have the airing dates different from what others have commented here.

Does anyone else like it a whole lot more? I enjoyed it before but this season just feels like they amped up what made it funny but without making it over the top.They've gone more for non traditional stuff and just thrown completely random things in like them having met on Real World.It's the opposite of most comedies where they tend to drop off a bit then hopefully regain their footing.

Who Charted is, by far, one of my favorite podcasts. It is entertaining week in and week out and they always have great guests. Casey Wilson was a guest a while back, as well - both episodes are worth listening to.[Episode 112 - Hollywood's Next Jew (Adam Pally)](http://www.earwolf.com/episode/hollywoods-next-jew/)[Episode 19 - Finding Love on Who Charted (Casey Wilson)](http://www.earwolf.com/episode/finding-love-on-who-charted/)Comedy Bang!

It's a fun episode, but the best ones feature Adam Pally as a character, not merely a guest. Adam's character on Comedy Bang! Bang! is Bro, host Scott Auckerman's pot dealer. He shows up both times that Andy Samberg is a guest - both episodes are highly recommended.

"So, as you may or may not know, we're not doing great in the ratings. The show will be pulled off the schedule in March, with only 15-17 of the ordered episodes for the season to air (don't worry -- all 22 will be produced, so there's that).I don't see many avenues for the show to continue on ABC. We're not getting a new timeslot and we're getting an untested lead-in (a cooking show).There are a few reasons why Happy Endings is the perfect show to take to cable: it has a loyal cult following, the quality is incredible, and it has 50 episodes in the can. So, I propose a three step process towards spreading the word and helping convincing another net to take the show:1) Evangelize the hell out of the show. Tell everyone. Post it on facebook. Post on twitter. Link to the episodes on Hulu. Use social media to spread the word. Even if we can, ever marginally, get the ratings and uptick, we can help show cable nets that there is an audience here that is ready for more ahmahzing times.2) Bug the shit out of TBS and ABC that you loooove this show. Write on their facebook walls: (https://www.facebook.com/TBSveryfunny?fref=ts, https://www.facebook.com/ABCNetwork). Tweet at them: (https://twitter.com/tbsveryfunny, https://twitter.com/ABCNetwork) Email them: (http://abc.go.com/site/contact-us, support@tbs.com). If you guys can think of anything that Fringe or Community did, that would also help. Maybe something super cheap that's very Happy Endings that we can send them.3) Buy the DVDs! It's almost Christmas, yeah? Tell ABC Studios and Sony that there is a fanbase that wants MORE! Give it to your mom! Your little sister! Your pastor! http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Dmovies-tv&field-keywords=happy+endingsWe need to make sure that as many people as possible know about this show.

"What I noticed while watching Happy Endings is that Alex behaviour got weirder and weirder every episode. While she started out as a decent character she became more of a weird crazy person, whose dialogue and behaviour was just ""different"", but also kind of cute and naive, from what you would expect from a ""normal"" person. For example when she had a crush on Max, or in ""The Butterfly Effect Effect"" where she is there physically, but is struggling to keep up with the conversations that are going on and therefore is making unfitting remarks which seem rather stupid and nonsensical. Like she is in a whole different world sometimes. So I just assumed that she had trouble with handling the loss of her relationship with Dave, or rather not being able to be as close to him as she was before, while also seeing him with other women. I'm not too sure about this, but I think that she was not in any kind of relationship after she left Dave at the altar. Therefore she was actually ""suffering"" throughout the whole series, which went by rather unnoticed with only a few hints towards her thoughts and feelings. Though I wonder how she will develop in the third season as she is closer to Dave now, who also showed a lot of rather childish traits lately.Well, in the end I just found her as a character and her development very interesting and was wondering how other people perceived it so far, so please do reply. :)TL;DR: Alex is actually going crazy.

Eliza Coupes legs alone are enough of a reason for me to enjoy this show. I honestly didn't know about this show until people on /r/community were saying that this show was worth the watch.

"Watched season 1 of HE and just loved it a few months back. Now that season 2 is over I'm looking forward to checking it out also, but I had a question for those of you who'd watched it. I noticed that watching S1 in the recommended viewing order instead of production code was a big mistake -- character development seemed to run backwards instead of forwards in many cases. But watching S1 by production code fixes all the inconsistency problems!I noticed that S2 is aired semi out of order again, and the second half of the episodes don't even have production code released ... my question is -- is there any of that same stuff like the Barefoot Peddler episode, where everybody seems to go back in time if you watch it in order? Or can you watch S2 in the suggested order without any of those shenanigans?Thanks :)",0

"All of the characters on the show have developed from season to season.  While watching season 2 its apparent that Dave hasnt moved past being the guy who got left at the altar, and then had the idea for Pangaea. His food truck and freedom from the daily grind are the only changes that he has initiated. He is the butt of every joke that is all that identifies him. All of the other characters have had ups and downs; Dave had a big down, and has mostly maintained afterwards. Having gone through the YouTube video aftermath and post wedding lows not much has happened. He should be more damaged or changed, or angry, or looking for the next thing; think midlife crisis but in his 30s. Like Ross on friends he is a party to stories, never the party. Brad has lost a job, become a trophy husband, and found a new job. Penny did the one thing she always wanted to do. She got engaged. Jane has started and climbed to the top of a new career, all while still working on charity events. Max became self-employed, had a long-term relationship for a sitcom, and took place in an epic prank war. Alex didnt date as much as Dave, but run away brideing was her reset button. She was happy at the start with the exception of her relationship woes. What can be said of Dave?Dave got left at the altar, quit his old job to start a risky food truck  if half of all new businesses fail I think its ever higher for restaurants. He got back together with the women who left him at the altar, rushed into a new apartment with her, and otherwise just hung out in the background. Its like he waits in the wings until they need to make fun of someone.Somehow this guy who was left at the altar and got back together with Alex realized things were going to fast but forged ahead anyway by moving in together. I want to like Dave but hes the guy whose dad is way cooler than him and he will never grow until he can move from under the shadow cast by others and does something, anything. If he were to propose to Alex, it would be dumb but it would be him taking a shot at something more; instead of sitting idly by as the rest of the characters progress. In the post breakup he dated women but nothing that lasted. Penny thought she was interested and they played that up until Dave and Alex get back together then out of the blue penny finds the one. Dave never truly went looking for himself and we are to believe that a guy who's obsessed with the fact that hes part native America wouldnt go on a vision quest or talk non stop about his spirit animal, why has he not gone to a local Indian casino and gotten in hot water with the local tribe? Or gotten a tattoo with his Indian name? What is his Indian name? He who drives with meat? ",0

A lot of the humour from the show comes from incredibly specific pop culture references which are hilarious if you understand them but make no sense otherwise. I like to think that I have a good knowledge of pop culture but sometimes even I have to look things up to get jokes (usually about American sports).I think this may be why it is doing so poorly in the ratings as so many people won't understand half of the jokes and see the brilliance of the show.,0

"I ABSOLUTELY love Happy Endings.  It wasn't a love at first sight kind of affair, more like savoring a fine wine, took some time, many episodes (probably the first full season) to like them, and then even more (half of the second season) to love them, but I have now re-watched every episode at least 3 or 4 times, and I still find new stuff to laugh at. Like Brad's expressions when someone else is talking, or Alex' stupidly awesome jokes.  And yes, I'm terrified that the show's low ratings might get it cancelled (NO NO NO NO NO NOOOOOOOOOOO), but I'm also sort of happy that it isn't popular.  It just feels more exclusive, more niche, more intimate, and a bit like that stunning and affordable restaurant that you want the whole world to know about but that you're also terrified of making popular just because you don't want it to lose its exclusivity and charm.  So I tell everyone about Happy Endings, I explain how wonderful it is, yet secretly I wish they don't tune in, just because they won't even get 20% of it, and that's what I like about it. It's a smart comedy, fast-paced, incredibly well written, even more incredibly well-acted, and with so much wits that it alienates a lot of viewers.  And somehow, I think ABC understands that this is what makes Happy Endings special. I hope I'm not too delusional about that.",0
I'm aware of that they kissed in episode 13 but that actually looked pretty fake. Like their lips weren't touching. Anyone else noticed this?Curious..,0
"USA NETWORK GREENLIGHTS ITS FIRST-EVER ORIGINAL HALF HOUR COMEDIESNEW YORK  May 16, 2013  USA Network today greenlit its first original half-hour comedies, with series orders for SIRENS from Denis Leary (Rescue Me) and Bob Fisher (Wedding Crashers) and PLAYING HOUSE from Jessica St. Clair (Bridesmaids, Best Friends Forever) and Lennon Parham (Best Friends Forever, Accidentally On Purpose). The network also picked up a new comedy pilot, LOVE IS DEAD. The new series will debut in the first quarter of 2014, and will be strong complements to MODERN FAMILY, the award-winning and top-rated comedy, which premieres on USA Tuesday, September 24 at 8/7c. The announcement was made in conjunction with USAs Upfront (#USAupfront), which is being held today at Pier 36 in New York.This is the right time to be introducing half hour original comedies to the USA audience. With MODERN FAMILY joining our line-up in the fall, we can leverage televisions most popular comedy to serve as a powerful launch pad for new originals in this genre, said Chris McCumber, Co-President of USA Network. Our new series come from some of the best comedic talent in the business, and reflect USAs style  with great characters, strong execution and compelling storytelling, said Jeff Wachtel, Co-President of USA Network.From the distinct comedic point of view of Leary and Fisher, SIRENS follows three of Chicagos best EMTs whose sometimes silly, self-righteous and even self-destructive personalities make them unqualified for sustaining relationships, friendships and most occupations. They are, however, uniquely qualified for saving anyone who winds up in their ambulance. Based on a UK format, SIRENS stars Michael Mosley (Pan Am), Kevin Daniels (Modern Family), Jessica McNamee (The Vow) and Kevin Bigley (Game Change). Leary and Fisher co-wrote the pilot and both executive produce the series. Jim Serpico (""Rescue Me"") of Apostle, and Hal Vogel, David Aukin (Hyde Park on Hudson), and David Leach of Daybreak Pictures also executive produce. Filmed on location in Chicago, the series is from Apostle and Fox Television Studios, in conjunction with Daybreak Pictures. PLAYING HOUSE is a single-camera buddy comedy about what happens when two best friends come back together, just when they need each other most. The original half-hour series is inspired by the ultra-close friendship between St. Clair and Parham. In PLAYING HOUSE, when mother to-be Maggie (Parham) asks her single and career-driven best friend Emma (St. Clair) to return home from her job overseas to attend her baby shower, she has no idea whats truly in store. Parham and St. Clair co-wrote the presentation and will executive produce the series along with Scot Armstrong (The Hangover: Part II, Old School) and Ravi Nandan (Best Friends Forever, Animal Practice) of American Work. The series is from Universal Cable Productions and American Work.LOVE IS DEAD (pilot order): This single-camera comedy is set at a unique company that specializes in breaking-up romantic relationships -- rationally, compassionately, thoroughly -- on behalf of those who are willing to pay to not be around when it happens.  Its the unconventional romantic comedy that asks: Why, if love is so fickle, do we keep coming back for more?  Written and executive produced by Zev Borow (Chuck), the pilot is from Universal Cable Productions and Gaumont International Television. Katie OConnell, Elisa Roth, Sidonie Dumas and Christophe Riandee executive produce for Gaumont International Television. The pilot is based on the award-winning French short film of the same name, written and directed by Eric Capitaine and produced by Carole Lambert and Carine Ruszniewski of De Films Aiguille.The #1 network in all of basic cable for an unprecedented seven straight years, USA Network is seen in over 102 million U.S. homes.

"Hey guys so I am not sure if this is the place to post this, but here I go anyways. When I was a child, things were just simpler. I remember having the time and inner peace to reflect on things, enjoy them more fully, and bask in the calmness of nothing. One of my most vivid memories is when I was about 10 years old reading the Hardy Boys. I was sleeping in the sun room and dozed off. When I woke up it was golden light streaming through the room, and I remember feeling the pinnacle of contentedness right then and there. I actually thought I was in a dream still, until I slowly came to my senses that it was real. This is a small example, yet it doesn't change that I haven't enjoyed anything 100% since around that time. It's almost like, becoming an adult creates a perpetual stone of reality in your gut that makes you never able to again fully escape into bliss. My question is, can adults feel like that too? I mean, VERY rarely for brief flashes of a few seconds, I will feel completely at peace with myself, and the sense of clarity that comes from that is RIDICULOUS! But it feels like an unattainable state of being, so any advice on what this is and how to deal with it would be greatly appreciated. ",0
"Hey everyone, noticed that there isn't a lot of activity in this sub, but I just wanted to say that I recently got the calm app and I have really enjoyed the effects of my meditation practice and being mindful. One small story of a change I have noticed is that I proctor 3 hour exams at the end of term (I am a grad student TA), and I used to dread the boredom. But this time around the exam did not seem to take so long to proctor. I was focused on my task, and was not constantly pulled away by day dreams and focusing on the amount of time remaining. Anyone else with examples of how meditation or mindfulness has impacted your life in big or small ways? Thanks!",0
